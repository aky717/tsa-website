We collected data on exam scores and failure rates in a wide array of STEM courses that had been taught by the same instructor via both traditional lecturing and active learning, and analyzed how the change in teaching approach impacted underrepresented minority and low-income students. On average, active learning reduced achievement gaps in exam scores and passing rates. Active learning benefits all students but offers disproportionate benefits for individuals from underrepresented groups. Widespread implementation of high-quality active learning can help reduce or eliminate achievement gaps in STEM courses and promote equity in higher education. We tested the hypothesis that underrepresented students in active-learning classrooms experience narrower achievement gaps than underrepresented students in traditional lecturing classrooms, averaged across all science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields and courses. We conducted a comprehensive search for both published and unpublished studies that compared the performance of underrepresented students to their overrepresented classmates in active-learning and traditional-lecturing treatments. This search resulted in data on student examination scores from 15 studies (9,238 total students) and data on student failure rates from 26 studies (44,606 total students). Bayesian regression analyses showed that on average, active learning reduced achievement gaps in examination scores by 33% and narrowed gaps in passing rates by 45%. The reported proportion of time that students spend on in-class activities was important, as only classes that implemented high-intensity active learning narrowed achievement gaps. Sensitivity analyses showed that the conclusions are robust to sampling bias and other issues. To explain the extensive variation in efficacy observed among studies, we propose the heads-and-hearts hypothesis, which holds that meaningful reductions in achievement gaps only occur when course designs combine deliberate practice with inclusive teaching. Our results support calls to replace traditional lecturing with evidence-based, active-learning course designs across the STEM disciplines and suggest that innovations in instructional strategies can increase equity in higher education.",https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/117/12/6476.full.pdf,

We controlled for 1) instructor effects by analyzing data from quarters when the same instructor taught the course, 2) exam equivalence with new assessments called the Weighted Bloom's Index and Predicted Exam Score, and 3) student equivalence using a regression-based Predicted Grade. We also tested the hypothesis that points from reading quizzes, clicker questions, and other “practice” assessments in highly structured courses inflate grades and confound comparisons with low-structure course designs. We found no evidence that points from active-learning exercises inflate grades or reduce the impact of exams on final grades. When we controlled for variation in student ability, failure rates were lower in a moderately structured course design and were dramatically lower in a highly structured course design.

In this study, we used machine learning (ML) algorithms to identify low-engagement students in a social science course at the Open University (OU) to assess the effect of engagement on student performance. The input variables of the study included highest education level, final results, score on the assessment, and the number of clicks on virtual learning environment (VLE) activities, which included dataplus, forumng, glossary, oucollaborate, oucontent, resources, subpages, homepage, and URL during the first course assessment. The output variable was the student level of engagement in the various activities. To predict low-engagement students, we applied several ML algorithms to the dataset. Using these algorithms, trained models were first obtained; then, the accuracy and kappa values of the models were compared. The results demonstrated that the J48, decision tree, JRIP, and gradient-boosted classifiers exhibited better performance in terms of the accuracy, kappa value, and recall compared to the other tested models. Based on these findings, we developed a dashboard to facilitate instructor at the OU.

Affect and behaviour detectors are used to estimate student affective states and behaviour based on post-hoc analysis of tutor log-data. For every student action in the tutor, the detectors give us an estimated probability that the student is in a state of boredom, engaged concentration, confusion, or frustration, and estimates of the probability that the student is exhibiting off-task or gaming behaviours. We used data from the ASSISTments math tutoring system and found that boredom during problem solving is negatively correlated with performance, as expected; however, boredom is positively correlated with performance when exhibited during scaffolded tutoring. A similar pattern is unexpectedly seen for confusion. Engaged concentration and, surprisingly, frustration are both associated with positive learning outcomes. In a second analysis, we build a unified model that predicts student standardized examination scores from a combination of student affect, disengaged behaviour, and performance within the learning system. This model achieves high overall correlation to standardized exam score, showing that these types of features can effectively infer longer-term learning outcomes.",https://learning-analytics.info/index.php/JLA/article/download/3536/4014,

There are four main findings. First, students are sorted into different school types largely on the basis of their entering exam score. Public schools attract the highest-scoring students, while private vocational schools serve the lowest-scoring students. Second, after controlling for a variety of characteristics, including test scores, male public school graduates earn a substantial premium over their privately schooled counterparts. Third, private vocational school graduates fare at least as well as private general graduates, despite coming from more disadvantaged socioeconomic backgrounds.

In the current study, we continue to characterize gender differences in our physics courses by examining the second-semester, electricity and magnetism course. We analyze three factors: student retention from Physics 1 to Physics 2, student performance, and students’ attitudes and beliefs about physics, and find gender differences in all three of these areas. Specifically, females are less likely to stay in the physics major than males. Despite males and females performing about equally on the conceptual pretest, we find that females score about 6 percentage points lower than males on the conceptual post-test. In most semesters, females outperform males on homework and participation, and males outperform females on exams, resulting in course grades of males and females that are not significantly different. In terms of students’ attitudes and beliefs, we find that both males and females shift toward less expertlike beliefs over the course of Physics 2. Shifts are statistically equal for all categories except for the Personal Interest category, where females have more negative shifts than males. A large fraction of the conceptual post-test gender gap up to 60% can be accounted for by differences in males’ and females’ prior physics and math performance and their pre-Physics 2 attitudes and beliefs.

Yet many students, especially those from lower-income backgrounds, find the high-stakes exams in courses necessary for STEM success to be stressful and anxiety provoking. Such experiences of stress can lead to underperformance and compromise students’ ability to advance in STEM. We show that lower-income students given the opportunity to emotionally regulate their worries and reinterpret their arousal go on to perform better on their high school science exams and endorse a more adaptive interpretation of stress. Critically, emotion regulation interventions cut in half the course failure rate for lower-income students. For many students, success is based on more than STEM knowledge—their ability to regulate emotions is important too. Educational attainment is one lever that can increase opportunity for economically disadvantaged families—especially in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM). Unfortunately, students from lower-income backgrounds often perform poorly and fail high school STEM courses, which are a necessary step in pursuing fast-growing and lucrative STEM careers, graduating high school, and matriculating to college. We reasoned that, because high school STEM courses often use high-stakes tests to gauge performance, and such tests can be especially stressful for lower-income students, interventions that help students regulate their negative emotions during tests should reduce the achievement gap between higher- and lower-income students. In a large-scale (n = 1,175) field experiment conducted in ninth grade science classrooms, students were asked to complete a control exercise, or they were given the opportunity to complete an exercise to help them regulate their worries and reinterpret their anxious arousal before their tests. We found significant benefits of emotion regulation activities for lower-income students in terms of their science examination scores, science course passing rate, and students’ attitudes toward examination stress, suggesting that students’ emotions are one factor that impacts performance. For example, 39% of lower-income students failed the course in the control group compared with only 18% of students failing the course if they participated in the emotion regulation interventions—a reduction in course failure rate by half. Our work underscores the crucial importance of targeting students’ emotions during impactful points in their academic trajectories for improving STEM preparedness and enhancing overall academic success.",https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/116/5/1553.full.pdf,

The fraction of copied submissions increased rapidly over the semester, as each weekly deadline approached and for problems later in each assignment. The majority of students, who copied less than 10% of their problems, worked steadily over the three days prior to the deadline, whereas repetitive copiers those who copied 30% of their submitted problems exerted little effort early. Importantly, copying homework problems that require an analytic answer correlates with a 2 decline over the semester in relative score for similar problems on exams but does not significantly correlate with the amount of conceptual learning as measured by pretesting and post-testing. An anonymous survey containing questions used in many previous studies of self-reported academic dishonesty showed 1 /3 less copying than actually was detected. The observed patterns of copying, free response questions on the survey, and interview data suggest that time pressure on students who do not start their homework in a timely fashion is the proximate cause of copying. Several measures of initial ability in math or physics correlated with copying weakly or not at all. Changes in course format and instructional practices that previous self-reported academic dishonesty surveys and/or the observed copying patterns suggested would reduce copying have been accompanied by more than a factor of 4 reduction of copying from 11% of all electronic problems to less than 3%. As expected since repetitive copiers have approximately three times the chance of failing, this was accompanied by a reduction in the overall course failure rate. Survey results indicate that students copy almost twice as much written homework as online homework and show that students nationally admit to more academic dishonesty than MIT students.",http://link.aps.org/pdf/10.1103/PhysRevSTPER.6.010104,

In this study, we compared results from a computer-based and paper-based exam in a sample of psychology students and found no differences in total scores across the two modes. Furthermore, we investigated student acceptance and change in acceptance of computer-based examining. After taking the computer-based exam, fifty percent of the students preferred paper-and-pencil exams over computer-based exams and about a quarter preferred a computer-based exam.

The Dundee Ready Education Environment Measure (DREEM) is a validated tool to assess the EE. This study aimed to collect baseline information about our medical student’s perception of the EE, and to identify areas of strengths and weaknesses as well as scope for improvements in the current EE. Methods: Medical students and interns were included in this cross-sectional study. The DREEM questionnaire was used to measure students’ perceptions about the EE, which has five domains: students’ perceptions of learning; students’ perceptions of teachers; students’ academic self-perceptions; students’ perceptions of atmosphere; and students’ social self-perceptions. Students were asked to respond using a 5-point Likert-type scale. Data was analyzed using suitable tests and statistical significance was set at p<0.05. Results: The mean global DREEM score was 123/200. All students had more positive than negative academic self-perception (21.24/32), perception of atmosphere (29.21/48), and perception of learning (28.99/48), while their social self-perception (17.48/28) was not too bad and perception of teachers (26.71/44) moved in the right direction. The fifth semester students perceived EE more positively than other semester students. Conclusion: The present study revealed that all students perceived their EE positively. The positive points were that teachers were knowledgeable, that students had good friends, and they were confident about passing their exams. Problem areas observed were authoritarian teachers, overemphasis on factual learning, overly teacher-centered teaching, teachers getting angry, and the need for a support system for stressed students.",https://doi.org/10.3946/kjme.2016.32,

Methods This was a cross-sectional study involving dental students from year one to year five from private and public universities in Malaysia. The study was formally approved by the Research and Ethics Committee, International Medical University Malaysia. Dental Environment Stress (DES) questionnaire was used for data collection and the gathered data were analyzed using SPSS® version 18. The Kruskal-Wallis and the Mann-Whitney U tests were used to compare stress items across various academic years and universities. Results A total of five hundred and twenty nine (529) students participated in this study. Fear of failing the course at the end of year exams (mean stress level=5.57); concerns regarding completion of clinical work (mean=5.30); and examination results and grades (mean=5.27) were found as top stressors among dental students. Female students had higher stress scores than males with respect to personal issues, academic performance, educational environment and learning of clinical skills. Students from public universities had higher stress scores than their counterparts from private universities. Conclusion The Malaysian dental students reported higher levels of stress.

However, the two exams have slightly different content domains, as well as different representational formats; hence, one exam or the other might better fit the interests of a given instructor or researcher. To begin the comparison, we outline how to determine a single-number score for the FMCE and present ranges of normalized gains on this exam. We then compare scores on the FCI and the FMCE for approximately 2000 students enrolled in the Studio Physics course at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute over a period of eight years (1998--2006) that encompassed significant evolution of the course and many different instructors. We found that the mean score on the FCI is significantly higher than the mean score on the FMCE, however there is a very strong relationship between scores on the two exams. The slope of a best fit line drawn through FCI versus FMCE data is approximately 0.54, and the correlation coefficient is approximately $r=0.78$, for preinstructional and postinstructional testings combined. In spite of this strong relationship, the assessments measure different normalized gains under identical circumstances. Additionally, students who scored well on one exam did not necessarily score well on the other. We use this discrepancy to uncover some subtle, but important, differences between the exams.

No single one of these proposed teaching strategies meets the needs of all students. The new Every Student Succeeds Act, successor to No Child Left behind Law, which transfers oversight from federal level back to states, could be a benefactor for constructivism and special education. Educators are also optimistic that the new Every Student Succeeds Act will be better for vulnerable students in special education because it will introduce more flexibility in how individual states carry out evaluation of students and teachers. In addition, it will provide more flexibility on testing and adapt the curriculum to student’s needs.

Previous studies have assessed ChatGPT’s performance in university or professional settings. However, the model’s potential in the context of standardized admission tests remains unexplored. Objective This study evaluated ChatGPT’s performance on standardized admission tests in the United Kingdom, including the BioMedical Admissions Test (BMAT), Test of Mathematics for University Admission (TMUA), Law National Aptitude Test (LNAT), and Thinking Skills Assessment (TSA), to understand its potential as an innovative tool for education and test preparation. Methods Recent public resources (2019-2022) were used to compile a data set of 509 questions from the BMAT, TMUA, LNAT, and TSA covering diverse topics in aptitude, scientific knowledge and applications, mathematical thinking and reasoning, critical thinking, problem-solving, reading comprehension, and logical reasoning. This evaluation assessed ChatGPT’s performance using the legacy GPT-3.5 model, focusing on multiple-choice questions for consistency. The model’s performance was analyzed based on question difficulty, the proportion of correct responses when aggregating exams from all years, and a comparison of test scores between papers of the same exam using binomial distribution and paired-sample (2-tailed) t tests. Results The proportion of correct responses was significantly lower than incorrect ones in BMAT section 2 (P<.001) and TMUA paper 1 (P<.001) and paper 2 (P<.001). No significant differences were observed in BMAT section 1 (P=.2), TSA section 1 (P=.7), or LNAT papers 1 and 2, section A (P=.3). ChatGPT performed better in BMAT section 1 than section 2 (P=.047), with a maximum candidate ranking of 73% compared to a minimum of 1%. In the TMUA, it engaged with questions but had limited accuracy and no performance difference between papers (P=.6), with candidate rankings below 10%. In the LNAT, it demonstrated moderate success, especially in paper 2’s questions; however, student performance data were unavailable. TSA performance varied across years with generally moderate results and fluctuating candidate rankings. Similar trends were observed for easy to moderate difficulty questions (BMAT section 1, P=.3; BMAT section 2, P=.04; TMUA paper 1, P<.001; TMUA paper 2, P=.003; TSA section 1, P=.8; and LNAT papers 1 and 2, section A, P>.99) and hard to challenging ones (BMAT section 1, P=.7; BMAT section 2, P<.001; TMUA paper 1, P=.007; TMUA paper 2, P<.001; TSA section 1, P=.3; and LNAT papers 1 and 2, section A, P=.2). Conclusions ChatGPT shows promise as a supplementary tool for subject areas and test formats that assess aptitude, problem-solving and critical thinking, and reading comprehension.

Clinical shifts during emergency medicine (EM) clerkships provide a wide variety of experiences, some of which may not be relevant to recommended educational objectives. Students can be directed to standardize their clinical experiences, and this improves performance on examinations. We hypothesized that applying a “flipped classroom” model to the clinical clerkship would improve performance on multiple-choice testing when compared to standard learning. Methods Students at two institutions were randomized to complete two of four selected EM clerkship topics in a “flipped fashion,” and two others in a standard fashion. For flipped topics, students were directed to complete chief complaint-based asynchronous modules prior to a shift, during which they were directed to focus on the chief complaint. For the other two topics, modules were to be performed at the students’ discretion, and shifts would not have a theme. At the end of the four-week clerkship, a 40-question multiple-choice examination was administered with 10 questions per topic. We compared performance on flipped topics with those performed in standard fashion. Students were surveyed on perceived effectiveness, ability to follow the protocol, and willingness of preceptors to allow a chief-complaint focus. Results Sixty-nine students participated; examination scores for 56 were available for analysis. For the primary outcome, no difference was seen between the flipped method and standard (p=0.494.) A mixed model approach showed no effect of flipped status, protocol adherence, or site of rotation on the primary outcome of exam scores. Students rated the concept of the flipped clerkship highly (3.48/5). Almost one third (31.1%) of students stated that they were unable to adhere to the protocol. Conclusion Preparation for a clinical shift with pre-assigned, web-based learning modules followed by an attempt at chief-complaint-focused learning during a shift did not result in improvements in performance on a multiple-choice assessment of knowledge; however, one third of participants did not adhere strictly to the protocol. Future investigations should ensure performance of pre-assigned learning as well as clinical experiences, and consider alternate measures of knowledge.",https://escholarship.org/content/qt2q83j70b/qt2q83j70b.pdf?t=p0w92u,

After failing to close a historically documented gender gap in a large introductory biology course using interventions targeted at training a growth mindset, we implemented interventions designed to reduce student test anxiety. We combined evidence-based exercises based on expressive writing and on reappraising physiological arousal. We also used a valid measure to quantify test anxiety at the start and end of the course. This instrument measures an individual’s self-declared or perceived test anxiety—also called trait anxiety—but not the immediate or “state” anxiety experienced during an actual exam. Consistent with previous reports in the literature, we found that women in this population declared much higher test anxiety than men and that students who declared higher test anxiety had lower exam scores than students who declared lower test anxiety. Although the test anxiety interventions had no impact on the level of self-declared trait anxiety, they did significantly increase student exam performance. The treatment benefits occurred in both men and women. These data suggest that 1) a combination of interventions based on expressive writing and reappraising physiological arousal can be a relatively easy manner to boost exam performance in a large-enrollment science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) course and encourage emotion regulation; 2) women are more willing than men to declare that they are anxious about exams, but men and women may actually experience the same level of anxiety during the exam itself; and 3) women are underperforming in STEM courses for reasons other than gender-based differences in mindset or test anxiety.",https://www.lifescied.org/doi/pdf/10.1187/cbe.18-05-0083,

Methods A prospective quasi-experimental study was carried out on a sample of 116 students. 10 multiple-choice questions were designed, with only one possible correct answer and a 20-second-limited response time for each of the questions. Four of these questions previously answered in the classroom using this game were chosen (20% of the exam). Each one of them corresponded to one unit of the topics taught in the subject. In order to participate in the educational game, students needed their smartphones or electronic devices. After completing the game, the students’ satisfaction level derived from its use was assessed. Results The correct answer rate in the educational game was greater than 50% for all questions except for one, in which the rate was 28.8% (P<0.05). Response time as related to score presented statistically significant differences, and higher scores for those questions with lower response time (P<0.001). The questions included in the final test which had been previously answered using Kahoot! showed a significantly higher difficulty index than the rest of the final exam questions (P<0.05). Question 3 was the easiest, while being the one in which the highest-scoring students obtained more wrong answers. For the students this tool was easy to use (89.6%) and they positively valued the content acquisition and comprehension, as well as the teacher-student interaction (P<0.05).

Consequently, reorientation of pharmacy education has become necessary. As such, active learning strategies have been introduced into classrooms to increase problem-solving and critical thinking skills of students. The objective of this study was to evaluate the performance and perceptions of competency of students in a new pharmaceutical care course that uses active learning methodologies. Methods This pharmaceutical care course was conducted in the first semester of 2014, in the Federal University of Sergipe. In the pharmaceutical care course, active learning methods were used, consisting of dialogic classroom expository, simulation and case studies. Student learning was evaluated using classroom tests and instruments that evaluated the perception of competency in pharmaceutical care practice. Furthermore, students' satisfaction with the course was evaluated. Results Thirty-three students completed the four evaluations used in the course (i.e., a discursive written exam, seminars, OSCE, and virtual patient); 25 were female (75.75%), and the median age was 23.43 (SD 2.82) years. The overall mean of student scores, in all evaluation methods was 7.97 (SD 0.59) on a scale of 0 to 10 points, and student performance on the virtual patient method was statistically superior to other methods. With respect to the perception of competency in pharmaceutical care practice, a comparison of pre- and post-test scores revealed statistically significant improvement for all evaluated competences. At the end of the semester, the students presented positive opinions of the pharmaceutical care course. Conclusions The results suggest that an active learning course can enhance the learning of pharmaceutical care competences. In future studies it will be necessary to compare active learning to traditional methods.",https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0123141&type=printable,

The primary objective was to determine if the mean positive cue rate for SBAs exceeded the null hypothesis guessing rate of 20%. Design This was a cross-sectional study undertaken in 2018. Setting 20 medical schools in the UK. Participants 1417 volunteer medical students preparing for their final undergraduate medicine examinations (total eligible population across all UK medical schools approximately 7500). Interventions Students completed a 50-question VSA test, followed immediately by the same test in SBA format, using a novel digital exam delivery platform which also facilitated rapid marking of VSAs. Main outcome measures The main outcome measure was the mean positive cue rate across SBAs: the percentage of students getting the SBA format of the question correct after getting the VSA format incorrect. Internal consistency, item discrimination and the pass rate using Cohen standard setting for VSAs and SBAs were also evaluated, and a cost analysis in terms of marking the VSA was performed. Results The study was completed by 1417 students. Mean student scores were 21 percentage points higher for SBAs. The mean positive cue rate was 42.7% (95% CI 36.8% to 48.6%), one-sample t-test against ≤20%: t=7.53, p<0.001. Internal consistency was higher for VSAs than SBAs and the median item discrimination equivalent. The estimated marking cost was £2655 ($3500), with 24.5 hours of clinician time required (1.25 s per student per question). Conclusions SBA questions can give a false impression of students’ competence. VSAs appear to have greater authenticity and can provide useful information regarding students’ cognitive errors, helping to improve learning as well as assessment.

Illustrations on paper were replaced by carousels full of photographic slides, which in turn have been supplanted by Powerpoint™ presentations. At an arguably much slower pace, the method of teaching microscopic anatomy to students of the healthcare professions is also changing. For the majority of medical students graduating before 2000, the microscope and accompanying boxes of glass slides were the standard tools for learning both histology and pathology. Studying for exams also included reviewing kodachromes showing static fields-of-view at predetermined magnifications. Both of these methods of learning required the student to be physically present on campus. Pathology residents, when not learning at the microscope with the attending pathologist, must rely on teaching sets of glass slides that cannot leave the department. Group learning must either be done at a multiheaded microscope (which many times has fewer heads than people present) or by use of video technology attached to the microscope. With the advent of digital whole slide imaging (WSI) over the past several years, there is an opportunity to revolutionize the way teaching and learning are done for all students of medicine including doctors, nurses, medical technicians, histology technicians, cytology technicians, and others. Comparison of Digital Whole Slide Images with Glass Slides There are many advantages to using WSI when compared with traditional glass slides [Table 1]. Digital images can be standardized; all students will study the exact same tissue section. Sections on glass slides are inherently variable in quality and content.[1] Although admittedly subtle in some cases, these variabilities can be eliminated with digital imaging. The quality of the image can also be indefinitely maintained compared to glass slides that are vulnerable to fading, breaking, and vanishing.[2] One very helpful aspect of digital images is the use of a thumbnail image. As students are examining the image at higher magnification, they can always refer to the thumbnail for orientation.[3] This obviously is impossible with glass slides. Glass slides cannot be easily annotated with any precision, relying on relatively crude “dotting” for the purposes of highlighting a certain area of the slide. Digital images can have multiple annotations including arrows, circles, text, etc. placed exactly where needed. Portability is another benefit of using digital images. The use of microscopes obligates a student to remain on campus in order to study, review, etc. With WSI loaded onto a web-based server, study can occur wherever and whenever the student wishes.[2] WSI also makes simultaneous viewing of a particular field-of-view possible; a major advantage over glass slides. Viewing the image on a common computer monitor encourages discussion and collaboration between classmates.[1] Finally, storage of WSI becomes a matter of having enough server memory. As server space becomes less and less expensive, the cost and effort of storing and maintaining both the microscopes and glass slide sets will become comparatively more burdensome.[3] Some disadvantages that have become apparent with WSI include the dependence of the image quality on monitor resolution and the challenge of scanning tissue sections that have artifacts such as folds, etc.[3] Judicious choice of an acceptable non-cost prohibitive monitor is essential for an accurate image. As digital scanners become “smarter”, the flaws in a slide will likely become less of an issue. Table 1 Benefits of digital slide imaging Educational Applications of Digital Whole Slide Imaging The educational applications for this technology are growing. Histology and pathology laboratories and small group study sessions are the early opportunities for medical student use either in a formal computer laboratory or via personal laptops. For those students choosing a pathology residency, WSI can be used for didactic lectures and unknown conferences. Independent study can be encouraged and facilitated with the use of organ-system-based teaching sets, of both neoplastic and non-neoplastic diseases. Diagnostic skills can also be assessed with WSI exams. One academic center looked at the reliability of WSI for measuring resident competency. Using a set of 20 questions based upon 20 whole slide images, junior and senior residents were tested. They determined that the correlation between exam score and months of training was high, the correlation with the resident in-service examination (RISE) was not quite as high, and that the exam could reliably discriminate between junior and senior residents.[4] WSI can also be used for teaching residents or fellows in clinical fields. For pathologists in either academic or non-academic medical centers, WSI can be implemented into both teaching and working interdepartmental conferences such as tumor boards and biopsy conferences (renal, liver, transplant, etc.). For the established pathologist, WSI has become a convenient method of acquiring continuing medical education credits offered through national pathology organization websites. Additional uses for WSI including the creation of electronic books will certainly evolve over time.",https://doi.org/10.4103/2153-3539.68331,

However, the costs to use an educational game design with efficient delivery of the game/course plan can be problematic. Our first objective was to evaluate the effectiveness of gamification by using existing techniques (e.g., simple HTML-based games) and readily available collaborative tools (e.g., Wikis) from a typical learning management system (LMS) such as Blackboard. Moreover, our second objective was to examine students’ attitudes towards gamification (e.g., usefulness). Data were collected from 2015 to 2017 (n = 80) at a Midwestern university in the United State using a mixed methods approach. For the quantitative method, online surveys were conducted in an experimental group (class with implementation of gamification) and control group (class without any gamified activities) that were randomly selected from graduate level statistics courses. For the qualitative method, the researcher conducted semi-structured interviews with subjects who addressed their interests to be interviewed during the online survey. A Welch’s independent t-test revealed a significant difference (p < 0.001) in the mean exam scores of experiment and control groups. A difference favored the classes with gamification. More than 70 % of students agreed that gamified activities were either extremely or highly useful in helping them review and/or understand fundamental concepts. In conclusion, using built-in LMS tools to design gamified learning activities may enhance students’ learning outcome/effectiveness, provide more diversified learning methods and motivation, and offer easy modifications for different learning needs.",https://olj.onlinelearningconsortium.org/index.php/olj/article/download/1466/401,

Postoperative rotator cuff tears can lead to pain, proximal humeral migration, and glenoid component loosening. The purpose of this paper was to evaluate the incidence of post-TSA rotator cuff tears or dysfunction in osteoarthritic patients. A systematic review of multiple databases was performed using preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses guidelines. Levels I-IV evidence clinical studies of patients with primary osteoarthritis with a minimum 2-year follow-up were included. Fifteen studies with 1259 patients (1338 shoulders) were selected. Student's t-tests were used with a significant alpha value of 0.05. All patients demonstrated significant improvements in motion and validated clinical outcome scores (P < 0.001). Radiographic humeral head migration was the most commonly reported data point for extrapolation of rotator cuff integrity. After 6.6 ± 3.1 years, 29.9 ± 20.7% of shoulders demonstrated superior humeral head migration and 17.9 ± 14.3% migrated a distance more than 25% of the head.

The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of cortisol level, which increases in healthy young individuals due to stress, on dynamic and static balance scores as well as to present the results caused by high levels of stress. METHODS: In this study, 107 healthy medicine faculty students in their second year (who will take the same committee exam) aged between 19 and 23 years were included. The first balance measurements and saliva samples were taken 40 days before the committee exam, and this period was acknowledged as the relaxed period.

We implemented blended along with on-site (i.e. face-to-face) learning to further assess the potential value of web-based learning in medical statistics. Methods This was a prospective study conducted with third year medical undergraduate students attending the Faculty of Medicine, University of Belgrade, who passed (440 of 545) the final exam of the obligatory introductory statistics course during 2013–14. Student statistics achievements were stratified based on the two methods of education delivery: blended learning and on-site learning. Blended learning included a combination of face-to-face and distance learning methodologies integrated into a single course. Results Mean exam scores for the blended learning student group were higher than for the on-site student group for both final statistics score (89.36±6.60 vs. 86.06±8.48; p = 0.001) and knowledge test score (7.88±1.30 vs. 7.51±1.36; p = 0.023) with a medium effect size.

In a multivariable regression model, current GPA and knowledge test scores were associated with the final statistics score after adjusting for study duration and learning modality (p<0.001). Conclusion This study provides empirical evidence to support educator decisions to implement different learning environments for teaching medical statistics to undergraduate medical students. Blended and on-site training formats led to similar knowledge acquisition; however, students with higher GPA preferred the technology assisted learning format.

METHODS All first-year students (N = 125) of the Gulf Medical University (GMU) in Ajman, United Arab Emirates (UAE), were invited to participate in a voluntary, anonymous, self-administered, questionnaire-based survey in January 2011. Psychological health was assessed using the 12-item General Health Questionnaire. A 24-item questionnaire, with items related to academic, psychosocial and health domains was used to identify sources of stress. Pearson's chi-squared test and the Mann-Whitney U-test were used for testing the association between psychological morbidity and sources of stress. RESULTS A total of 112 students (89.6%) completed the survey and the overall prevalence of psychological morbidity was found to be 33.6%. The main academic-related sources of stress were 'frequency of exams', 'academic workload', and 'time management'. Major psychosocial stressors were 'worries regarding future', 'high parental expectations', 'anxiety', and 'dealing with members of the opposite sex'. Health-related issues were 'irregular eating habits', 'lack of exercise', and 'sleep-related problems'. Psychological morbidity was not significantly associated with any of the demographic factors studied. However, total stress scores and academics-related domain scores were significantly associated with psychological morbidity. CONCLUSION Psychological morbidity was seen in one in three first-year students attending GMU. While worries regarding the future and parental expectations were sources of stress for many students, psychological morbidity was found to be significantly associated with only the total stress and the academic-related domain scores.",https://doi.org/10.12816/0003114,

Methods: The action research project included seventy nine student participants at the Texas A&M Health Science Center College of Medicine during their pre-clinical education. Data collection included pre-matriculation and matriculation academic performance data, standardized exam data, and the Learning and Study Strategies Instrument. Multiple regression analyses were conducted. For both models, the dependent variable was the Step 1 score, and the independent variables included Medical College Admission Test, Undergraduate Grade Point Average, Year 1 Average, Year 2 Average, Customized National Board of Medical Examiners Average, Comprehensive Basic Science Exam score, and Learning and Study Strategy Instrument sub-scores. Model 2 added Comprehensive Basic Science Self-Assessment average. Results: Concentration (Model 1 - β = .264; Model 2 - β = .254) was the only study strategy correlated with Step 1 performance. The other statistically significant predictors were Customized National Board of Medical Examiners Average (β = .315) and Year 2 Average (β = .280) in Model 1 and Comprehensive Basic Science Self-Assessment Average (β = .338) in Model 2. Conclusions: There does appear to be a relationship between the study strategy concentration and Step 1 licensing exam performance.

To demonstrate the feasibility of integrating the computer simulation, MyDispense, into a therapeutics course and to measure its effects on student perception and learning. Methods. We conducted a prospective study with an experimental phase and an implementation phase. In the first phase, students were randomized to complete a therapeutics case using MyDispense or traditional paper methods in class. In the second phase, all students completed two therapeutic cases using MyDispense in class with the option to complete four additional outside-of-class cases using MyDispense. Students completed pre- and post-tests in class and three surveys. Results. In the experimental phase, mean test scores increased from pre- to post-test for both MyDispense and traditional paper groups, but the difference between the groups was not statistically significant. Students in the traditional paper group reported statistically significant gains in confidence compared to the MyDispense group. In the implementation phase, mean test scores again increased, however, student perception of the use of MyDispense for therapeutics was negative.

Although U.S. medical schools have worked to increase the matriculation and academic success of underrepresented minority (URM) students (African Americans, Latinos, others), they have had only limited success. Lower standardized test scores, including on the Medical College Admission Test (MCAT), have been a barrier to matriculation for many URM applicants. Lower subsequent standardized exam scores, including on the United States Medical Licensing Exam Step 1, also have been an impediment to students’ progress, with mean scores for URM students lagging behind those for others. Approach Faculty at the Morehouse School of Medicine developed and implemented interventions to enhance the academic success of their URM students (about 75% are African American, and 5% are from other URM groups). To assess the outcomes of this work, the authors analyzed the MCAT scores and subsequent Step 1 scores of students in the graduating classes of 2009–2014. They also reviewed course evaluations, Graduation Questionnaires, and student and faculty interviews and focus groups. Outcomes Students’ Step 1 scores exceeded those expected based on their MCAT scores. This success was due to three key elements: (1) milieu and mentoring, (2) structure and content of the curriculum, and (3) monitoring. Next Steps A series of mixed-method studies are planned to better discern the core elements of faculty–student relationships that are key to students’ success.

Team-based learning (TBL) is one active learning strategy that builds on individuals' strengths by allowing them to collaborate and work as a team to achieve a common learning objective. AIMS The present study aims to evaluate the impact of TBL on student performance. It also aims to assess students' attitudes towards TBL and the feasibility of its incorporation into the course curriculum. METHODS From a class of 241 students, 128 who agreed to participate in the study underwent two sessions of TBL each consisting of Individual and Group Readiness Assurance Tests (IRATs and GRATs). The readiness assurance tests each had 13 multiple choice questions (MCQ). To analyse the impact of TBL supplementation, the median sessional MCQ scores of students who underwent TBL supplementation (group 1) were compared with those who did not undergo the session (group 2). Students' experiences with TBL and their attitudes towards incorporation of TBL into the course curriculum were analysed using a feedback questionnaire that was given to students who underwent TBL. RESULTS Students belonging to the TBL group performed significantly better than the students who did not undergo TBL (p<0.001). The median sessional MCQ score of the TBL group was seven and non-TBL group was six. The overall mean attitude score obtained from feedback questionnaires was 3.57, which indicates a positive attitude towards TBL. CONCLUSION The team-based learning session improved student engagement with course content. The majority of the students felt that TBL supplementation enhanced their understanding of course content and believe that it will help them perform better in their exams.",https://doi.org/10.4066/amj.2014.2244,

Men ’ s average pretest scores on the Force Concept Inventory and Force and Motion Conceptual Evaluation are 13% higher than women ’ s, and post-test scores are on average 12% higher than women ’ s. This study analyzed the gender differences within the Conceptual Survey of Electricity and Magnetism (CSEM) in which the gender gap has been less well studied and is less consistent. In the current study, data collected from 1407 students (77% men, 23% women) in a calculus-based physics course over ten semesters showed that male students outperformed female students on the CSEM pretest (5%) and post-test (6%). Separate analyses were conducted for qualitative and quantitative problems on lab quizzes and course exams and showed that male students outperformed female students by 3% on qualitative quiz and exam problems. Male and female students performed equally on the quantitative course exam problems. The gender gaps within CSEM post-test scores, qualitative lab quiz scores, and qualitative exam scores were insignificant for students with a CSEM pretest score of 25% or less but grew as pretest scores increased. Structural equation modeling demonstrated that a latent variable, called Conceptual Physics Performance/Non-Quantitative (CPP/NonQnt), orthogonal to quantitative test performance was useful in explaining the differences observed in qualitative performance; this variable was most strongly related to CSEM post-test scores. The CPP/NonQnt of male students was 0.44 standard deviations higher than female students. The CSEM pretest measured CPP/NonQnt much less accurately for women ( R 2 ¼ 4% ) than for men ( R 2 ¼ 17% ). The failure to detect a gender gap for students scoring 25% or less on the pretest suggests that the CSEM instrument itself is not gender biased. The failure to find a performance difference in quantitative test performance while detecting a gap in qualitative performance suggests the qualitative differences do not result from psychological factors such as science anxiety or stereotype threat.

Method Multiple linear regression, correlation, and chi-square analyses were performed to determine the relationship between MCAT component and composite scores and USMLE Step 1 and Step 2 CK scores from five graduating classes (2011–2015) at the University of Minnesota Medical School (N=1,065). Results The multiple linear regression analyses were both significant (p<0.001). The three MCAT component scores together explained 17.7% of the variance in Step 1 scores (p<0.001) and 12.0% of the variance in Step 2 CK scores (p<0.001). In the chi-square analyses, significant, albeit weak associations were observed between almost all MCAT component scores and USMLE scores (Cramer's V ranged from 0.05 to 0.24). Discussion Each of the MCAT component scores was significantly associated with USMLE Step 1 and Step 2 CK scores, although the effect size was small. Being in the top or bottom scoring range of the MCAT exam was predictive of being in the top or bottom scoring range of the USMLE exams, although the strengths of the associations were weak to moderate. These results indicate that MCAT scores are predictive of student performance on the USMLE exams, but, given the small effect sizes, should be considered as part of the holistic view of the student.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.3402/meo.v21.31795?needAccess=true,

We used a mixed-methods study design and collected data over two semesters. Self-evaluation, a component of metacognition, was measured via exam score postdictions, in which students estimated their exam scores after completing their exam. Metacognitive awareness was assessed using the Metacognitive Awareness Inventory (MAI) and a reflective essay designed to gauge students’ perceptions of their metacognitive skills and study habits. In both semesters, more students over-predicted their Exam 1 scores than under-predicted, and statistical tests revealed significantly lower mean exam scores for the over-predictors. By Exam 3, under-predictors still scored significantly higher on the exam, but they outnumbered the over-predictors. Lower-performing students also displayed a significant increase in exam postdiction accuracy by Exam 3. While there was no significant difference in students’ MAI scores from the beginning to the end of the semester, qualitative analysis of reflective essays indicated that students benefitted from the assignments and could articulate clear action plans to improve their learning and performance.

Students who engage in e-learning can access tests and exams online, making education more flexible and accessible. This work reports on the design of an e-learning system that makes recommendations to students to improve their learning. This artificial intelligence-based student assessment and recommendation (AISAR) system consists of score estimation, clustering, performance prediction, and recommendation. In addition, the importance of student authentication is recognised in situations in which students must authenticate themselves prior to using the e-learning system using their identity, password, and personal identification number. Individual scores are determined using a recurrent neural network (RNN) based on student engagement and examination scores. Then, a density-based spatial clustering algorithm (DBSCAN) using Mahalanobis distance clustering is implemented to group students based on their obtained score values. The constructed clusters are validated by estimating purity and entropy. Student performance is predicted using a threshold-based MapReduce (TMR) procedure from the score-based cluster. When predicting student performance, students are classified into two groups: average and poor, with the former being divided into below- and above-average students and the latter into poor and very poor students. This categorisation aims to provide useful recommendations for learning. A recommendation reinforcement learning algorithm, the rule-based state–action–reward–state–action (R-SARSA) algorithm, is incorporated for evaluation. Students were required to work on their subjects according to the provided recommendations. This e-learning recommendation system achieves better performance in terms of true-positives, false-positives, true-negatives, false-negatives, precision, recall, and accuracy.",https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/14/17/10551/pdf?version=1661513028,

Methods In a within-subject experimental design, medical students who had finished the CBCR course participated in an illness script experiment. In the first session, richness and maturity of students’ illness scripts for diseases discussed during the CBCR course were compared to illness script richness and maturity for similar diseases not included in the course. In the second session, diagnostic performance was tested, to test for differences between CBCR cases and non-CBCR cases. Scores on the CBCR course exam were related to both experimental outcomes. Results Thirty-two medical students participated. Illness script richness for CBCR diseases was almost 20% higher than for non-CBCR diseases, on average 14.47 (SD=3.25) versus 12.14 (SD=2.80), respectively (p<0.001). In addition, students provided more information on Enabling Conditions and less on Fault-related aspects of the disease.

While there are many critics of the practice it still finds wide spread acceptance particularly in science classes. Advocates believe that in large classes student ability is likely to be normally distributed. If test scores are also normally distributed instructors and students tend to believe that the test reasonably measures learning and that the grades are assigned fairly. Beyond an intuitive reaction, is there evidence that normally distributed test scores appropriately distinguish among student performance? Can we be sure that there is a significant correlation between test scores and student knowledge? Testing these assumptions would be difficult using actual subjects. In this paper we use mathematical models and Monte Carlo simulation to test the assumption that normally distributed grades assign the highest grades to the students who were best prepared for an exam.",https://digitalcommons.georgiasouthern.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1101&context=ij-sotl,

The aim of this study is to evaluate a novice medical training method (problem-based learning) as compared to the contemporary teacher-based medical education or traditional methods. Methods: Selection of the study subjects was done through simple sampling and according to the division of medical students introduced from Medical Faculty to the Pediatrics Department with no personal involvement. 120 medical students were assigned to 8 groups of 15 students each. For four months, 4 groups were trained with traditional method and 4 other groups underwent problem-based learning method on selected subject materials. In each method, a pre-course test at the beginning and a post-course test at the end of each course were given to each group. The questionnaire used in this study as the instrument was composed of 39 questions, 37 multiple choice questions and two short answer questions. Three professors of pediatric gastroenterologist took part in the training. Two of these professors were responsible for solving task training method. The third professor used traditional teacher-centered methodology to eliminate any possible bias. Scores obtained from these tests were analyzed using paired t-test and independent t-test. P-values of less than 0.05 were considered as significant. Results: The scores of the students undergoing the traditional method were 14.70±3.03 and 21.20±4.07 in the first and second test, respectively. In problem-based learning, the scores were 15.82±3.29 in the first and 27.52±4.72 in the second test. There was a significant difference between the mean scores of post-course exams of the two groups (p=0.001), while no significant difference was observed between the mean scores of pre-course exams of the groups (p=0.550). Conclusion: It may be concluded that problem-based learning method leads to a significant increase in learning and recalling output compared to the traditional method. Given the evolving medical education in the country's medical schools toward problem-based learning, it is suggested that the grounds be laid so that this change will take place based on thought, principles and problem solving.",,

However, studies that have evaluated the quality of MCQs used in higher education assessments have found many flawed items, resulting in misleading insights about student performance and contaminating important decisions. Thus, MCQs need to be evaluated statistically to ensure high quality items are used as the basis of inferences. This study evaluated the quality of 100 instructor-written MCQs used in an undergraduate midterm test (50 items) and final exam (50 items), making up 50% of the course grade, using the responses of 380 students enrolled in one 1st-year undergraduate general education course. Item difficulty, discrimination, and chance properties were determined using Classical Test Theory and Item Response Theory statistical item analysis models. The two-parameter logistic model consistently had the best fit to the data. The impact on overall course grades between the original raw score model and the IRT 2PL model showed 70% of students would receive the same grade (i.e., D to A), but only one-third would get the same mark using the standard augmented grade scale (i.e., A+ to D-).

This study delves into the capabilities of AI in physics education and offers actionable AI policy recommendations. Using openAI’s flagship gpt-3.5-turbo large language model (LLM), we assessed its ability to answer 1337 physics exam questions spanning general certificate of secondary education (GCSE), A-Level, and introductory university curricula. We employed various AI prompting techniques: Zero Shot, in context learning, and confirmatory checking, which merges chain of thought reasoning with reflection. The proficiency of gpt-3.5-turbo varied across academic levels: it scored an average of 83.4% on GCSE, 63.8% on A-Level, and 37.4% on university-level questions, with an overall average of 59.9% using the most effective prompting technique. In a separate test, the LLM’s accuracy on 5000 mathematical operations was found to be 45.2%. When evaluated as a marking tool, the LLM’s concordance with human markers averaged at 50.8%, with notable inaccuracies in marking straightforward questions, like multiple-choice. Given these results, our recommendations underscore caution: while current LLMs can consistently perform well on physics questions at earlier educational stages, their efficacy diminishes with advanced content and complex calculations. LLM outputs often showcase novel methods not in the syllabus, excessive verbosity, and miscalculations in basic arithmetic. This suggests that at university, there’s no substantial threat from LLMs for non-invigilated physics questions. However, given the LLMs’ considerable proficiency in writing physics essays and coding abilities, non-invigilated examinations of these skills in physics are highly vulnerable to automated completion by LLMs. This vulnerability also extends to pysics questions pitched at lower academic levels. It is thus recommended that educators be transparent about LLM capabilities with their students, while emphasizing caution against overreliance on their output due to its tendency to sound plausible but be incorrect.",https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-6552/ad1fa2/pdf,

Methods: In a quantitative, quasi-experimental post-test study, 221 undergraduate senior nursing students participated in the TBL course or a traditional instructor-led control course.  In both courses, academic performance was measured by the HESI ® Management scores; critical thinking, leadership and management skills, and overall course experience were measured using an online survey. In the TBL course, accountability to learning, preference for lecture or TBL, and learner satisfaction was measured with the Team-Based Learning Student Assessment Instrument. Results: When compared to lecture, TBL learners scored significantly higher on the HESI ® Management exam and reported significantly higher critical thinking, leadership and management skills and better overall course experience ratings ( p ≤ .01). TBL learners reported moderate to high levels of accountability, higher preference for TBL than lecture, and satisfaction with TBL. Total scores indicated moderate to high levels of favorable experiences with TBL. Conclusions: Results indicate TBL is an acceptable and efficacious instructional strategy in undergraduate nursing students. To control for extraneous factors and limit confounding, future research should evaluate the impact of TBL via a randomized control trial.",https://doi.org/10.5430/jnep.v6n4p59,

However, some experts have criticized the Kolb theory and argue that there are some ambiguities on the validity of the theory as an important predictor of achievement. This study has been carried out on dental students’ educational achievement in relation to their dominant learning styles based on Kolb theory in Mashhad University of Medical Sciences (Iran). Methods: In a cross sectional study, Kolb Learning Style Inventory (LSI Ver. 3.1) as well as a questionnaire containing students’ demographic data, academic achievement marks including grade point average (GPA), theoretical and practical courses marks, and the comprehensive basic sciences exam (CBSE) scores were administered on a purposive sample of 162 dental students who had passed their comprehensive basic sciences exam. Educational achievement data were analyzed in relation to students’ dominant learning styles, using descriptive and analytical statistics including χ2, Kruskal-Wallis and two-way ANOVA tests. Results: The dominant learning styles of students were Assimilating (53.1%), Converging (24.1%), Diverging (14.2%) and Accommodating (8.6%). Although, the students with Assimilating and Converging learning styles had a better performance on their educational achievement, there was no significant relationship between educational achievement and dominant learning style (P≥0.05). Conclusion: Findings support that the dominant learning style is not exclusively an essential factor to predict educational achievement. Rather, it shows learning preferences of students that may be considered in designing learning opportunities by the teachers.",https://ccsenet.org/journal/index.php/gjhs/article/download/42933/24698,

Virtual patient simulators (VPSs) may partially meet these needs. Natural language processing (NLP) and intelligent tutoring systems (ITSs) may further enhance the educational impact of these simulators. Objective The goal of this study was to develop a VPS for clinical diagnostic reasoning that integrates interaction in natural language and an ITS. We also aimed to provide preliminary results of a short-term learning test administered on undergraduate students after use of the simulator. Methods We trained a Siamese long short-term memory network for anamnesis and NLP algorithms combined with Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine (SNOMED) ontology for diagnostic hypothesis generation. The ITS was structured on the concepts of knowledge, assessment, and learner models. To assess short-term learning changes, 15 undergraduate medical students underwent two identical tests, composed of multiple-choice questions, before and after performing a simulation by the virtual simulator. The test was made up of 22 questions; 11 of these were core questions that were specifically designed to evaluate clinical knowledge related to the simulated case. Results We developed a VPS called Hepius that allows students to gather clinical information from the patient’s medical history, physical exam, and investigations and allows them to formulate a differential diagnosis by using natural language. Hepius is also an ITS that provides real-time step-by-step feedback to the student and suggests specific topics the student has to review to fill in potential knowledge gaps. Results from the short-term learning test showed an increase in both mean test score (P<.001) and mean score for core questions (P<.001) when comparing presimulation and postsimulation performance. Conclusions By combining ITS and NLP technologies, Hepius may provide medical undergraduate students with a learning tool for training them in diagnostic reasoning. This may be particularly useful in a setting where students have restricted access to clinical wards, as is happening during the COVID-19 pandemic in many countries worldwide.",https://medinform.jmir.org/2021/4/e24073/PDF,

We developed and pilot tested four Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE) stations intended to reflect socio-cultural dimensions in the Canadian Patient Safety Institute's Safety Competency Framework. Setting and participants 18 third year undergraduate medical and nursing students at a Canadian University. Methods OSCE cases were developed by faculty with clinical and PS expertise with assistance from expert facilitators from the Medical Council of Canada. Stations reflect domains in the Safety Competency Framework (ie, managing safety risks, culture of safety, communication). Stations were assessed by two clinical faculty members. Inter-rater reliability was examined using weighted κ values. Additional aspects of reliability and OSCE performance are reported. Results Assessors exhibited excellent agreement (weighted κ scores ranged from 0.74 to 0.82 for the four OSCE stations). Learners’ scores varied across the four stations. Nursing students scored significantly lower (p<0.05) than medical students on three stations (nursing student mean scores=1.9, 1.9 and 2.7; medical student mean scores=2.8, 2.9 and 3.5 for stations 1, 2 and 3, respectively where 1=borderline unsatisfactory, 2=borderline satisfactory and 3=competence demonstrated). 7/18 students (39%) scored below ‘borderline satisfactory’ on one or more stations. Conclusions Results show (1) four OSCE stations evaluating socio-cultural dimensions of PS achieved variation in scores and (2) performance on this OSCE can be evaluated with high reliability, suggesting a single assessor per station would be sufficient.

Training of PoCUS is challenging, time-consuming and requires large amount of resources. The objective of our study was to evaluate if this training process can be simplified by allowing medical students self-train themselves with a web-based cardiac ultrasound software. Methods A prospective, single blinded, cohort study, comparing performance of 29 medical students in performing a six-minutes cardiac ultrasound exam. Students were divided into two groups: self-learning group, using a combination of E-learning software and self-practice using pocket ultrasound device compared to formal, frontal cardiac ultrasound course. Results All 29 students completed their designated courses and performed the six-minutes exam: 20 students participated in the frontal cardiac ultrasound course and 9 completed the self-learning course. The median (Q1,Q3) test score for the self-learning group was higher than the frontal course group score, 18 (15,19) versus 15 (12,19.5), respectively. Nevertheless, no statistically significant difference was found between the two study groups (p = 0.478).

Kahoot! is a mobile game-based online digital formative assessment tool that can engage students in its learning. This study is the first to assess the effect of Kahoot! use on Pathology learning outside classroom using a comparative group with assessment done at the end of the course. Methods: The study was carried out on the first-year Pathology students at Helwan University, Faculty of Medicine, after ending a basic Pathology course. The study is a retrospective quasi-experimental quantitative study. Academic performance of students in Pathology was compared between Kahoot! and non-Kahoot! users (55 students each). In addition, an online survey was introduced to the 55 Kahoot! user students to investigate their perceptions on it. Survey and test score data were analyzed by appropriate tests using IBM-SPSS (Statistical Package for Social Sciences). The level of significance was P < 0.05. Results: Kahoot! enhanced Pathology understanding (83.6%), retaining knowledge (87.3%), made learning fun and motivating (89.1%). Other mentioned advantages of Kahoot! were practicing for exam (40%), simple and easy to use (36.4%), competitive (18.2%), self confidence booster (10.9%), forming a comprehensive image of the lecture (9%), quick (9%), and imagining skills booster (5.5%). Mentioned disadvantages included no explanation for the answers to questions (20%). A quarter of the students stated that the time limit for the questions was short (27.3%). Kahoot! use was significantly associated with better Pathology academic performance (P = 0.001), and it was not related to the general academic performance of the students (P = 0.06). Most users (85.4%) recommended its continuous future use. Conclusions: The study offers an endorsement to the use of Kahoot! for gamifying formative assessment of Pathology and can provide a basis for the design of an online Kahoot! -based continuous formative assessment plans implemented outside-classroom in the Pathology curricula.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/20905068.2021.1954413?needAccess=true,

Although there has been research that uses TA and SE to predict student grades, no study to our knowledge has investigated this in the context of low- (e.g., homework and quizzes) and high-stakes (e.g., traditional exams) physics assessments. Using validated survey data and grade information, we compared the predictive power of SE and TA on student performance on a variety of assessment types. We found that there are gender differences in both SE and TA, as well as in high-stakes assessment outcomes. There were no gender differences in low-stakes assessment scores.

Medical schools have begun to implement ultrasound training in the pre-clinical curriculum, and the EM clerkship is an appropriate place to build upon this training. The objectives are (1) to evaluate the effectiveness of implementing a focused ultrasound curriculum within an established EM clerkship and (2) to obtain feedback from medical students regarding the program. Methods We conducted a prospective cohort study of medical students during an EM clerkship year from July 1, 2011, to June 30, 2012. Participants included fourth-year medical students (n=45) enrolled in the EM clerkship at our institution. The students underwent a structured program focused on the focused assessment with sonography for trauma exam and ultrasound-guided vascular access. At the conclusion of the rotation, they took a 10-item multiple choice test assessing knowledge and image interpretation skills. A cohort of EM residents (n=20) also took the multiple choice test but did not participate in the training with the students. We used an independent samples t-test to examine differences in test scores between the groups. Results The medical students in the ultrasound training program scored significantly higher on the multiple-choice test than the EM residents, t(63)=2.3, p<0.05. The feedback from the students indicated that 82.8% were using ultrasound on their current rotations and the majority (55.2%) felt that the one-on-one scanning shift was the most valuable aspect of the curriculum.

The CBL literature is sparse with respect to these outcomes, and this is especially so in the area of biochemistry. The present study determined the effect of CBL vs. non CBL on knowledge retention in an undergraduate biochemistry course; it also investigated associations of learning approach, age and gender. Methods: We used the Revised Two-Factor Study Process Questionnaire, a retention test, final exam grades and other demographic information to statistically compare academic outcomes of students subjected to either CBL or non-CBL active learning techniques. Results: We showed that students exposed to CBL in a second year course performed significantly better on a retention test conducted nine months after the final exam, and that there was a positive correlation between a deep learning approach and higher retention scores. We did not find an association between gender and age with the retention of biochemistry concepts. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that use of CBL in undergraduate biochemistry education may confer benefits in terms of retention of knowledge of key concepts.",http://www.sciedu.ca/journal/index.php/ijhe/article/download/11287/6928,

Methods In this retrospective study, we collected admission and college performance data for 737 students in preclinical and clinical years. Data included high school scores and other standardized test scores, such as those of the National Achievement Test and the General Aptitude Test. Additionally, we included the scores of the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) and the International English Language Testing System (IELTS) exams. Those datasets were then compared with college performance indicators, namely the cumulative Grade Point Average (cGPA) and progress test, using multivariate linear regression analysis. Results In preclinical years, both the National Achievement Test (p=0.04, B=0.08) and TOEFL (p=0.017, B=0.01) scores were positive predictors of cGPA, whereas the General Aptitude Test (p=0.048, B=-0.05) negatively predicted cGPA. Moreover, none of the pre-admission variables were predictive of progress test performance in the same group. On the other hand, none of the pre-admission variables were predictive of cGPA in clinical years. Overall, cGPA strongly predict-ed students’ progress test performance (p<0.001 and B=19.02). Conclusions Only the National Achievement Test and TOEFL significantly predicted performance in preclinical years. However, these variables do not predict progress test performance, meaning that they do not predict the functional knowledge reflected in the progress test. We report various strengths and deficiencies in the current medical college admission criteria, and call for employing more sensitive and valid ones that predict student performance and functional knowledge, especially in the clinical years.",https://www.ijme.net/archive/8/predictive-validity-of-pre-admission-assessments.pdf,

OBJECTIVE To assess the use of the OSCE as a tool to evaluate the abilities of undergraduate chest physical therapy students and to verify the internal consistency of the OSCE exam. METHODS Forty-seven students were evaluated using two types of exams: the traditional exam and the OSCE. Independent educators elaborated the exams. Each question (traditional) or station (OSCE) was given a score ranging from 0.0 to 2.0; being 10.0 the highest possible score of both exams. The relationship between the total score that were obtained from both exams was analyzed using Bland-Altman analysis and Pearson's correlation coefficient. The internal consistency of the OSCE stations was evaluated by four experienced chest physical therapists and it was tested using Cronbach's alpha. RESULTS The students' average score on the OSCE ranged from 4.4 to 9.6. The internal consistency of the OSCE stations was considered good (0.7). The agreement between exams was analyzed, and it was determined that the exams are not comparable. Examiners also observed a low agreement between the two exams (r=-0.1; p=0.9). CONCLUSION Our results showed that OSCE and traditional exams are not interchangeable.

NBDE I results favored men and approached significance (p = 0.066), while for Part II men significantly outscored women. NBDE I and II and NERB pass rates showed no significant differences. These board results were also controlled for previous academic performance. Although we found that differences existed between genders, which appear to be the ramification of the classic high-stakes dilemma (women do as well as men in the classroom and on course-related tests, but less well on gatekeeper board exams), the context mitigates their operational effects.

Despite some contradictions, the general trend in the literature is that more mature students usually outperform students with naive epistemic beliefs. We hypothesized that this relationship is reciprocal and learning strategies and task demands play a key role in building the schemas of epistemic beliefs. Accordingly, the requirements of traditional teaching and assessment methods might lead students to adopt less advanced epistemic beliefs that might be consistent with traditional learning strategies and task demands. To test this hypothesis, we compared the epistemic beliefs of high, average, and low level students (n = 165) in the traditional, developing educational system in UAE. Students were classified according to their performance on two formats of assessment; the regular exams and the continuous evaluation, using Arabic, standardized version of Epistemic beliefs Inventory prepared by Schraw et al, (2002). For the two assessment formats, the results were inconsistent with the traditional findings in the literature as advanced and medium students got higher scores (immature beliefs) than low level students on most epistemic beliefs, with the exception of the beliefs in Innate Ability (IA), where weak students got higher epistemic beliefs than advanced or medium level students.

Study Design: We conducted a randomized, prospective study involving volunteer junior (3rd year) medical students consecutively rotating through the Obstetrics and Gynecology clerkship during six months of the 2005-2006 academic year. The students were randomly assigned to permuted blocks and divided into two groups. Half of the participants received instruction in prenatal ultrasound diagnostics using an interactive CBL program; the other half received instruction using equivalent material by the traditional PBM. Outcomes were evaluated by comparing changes in pre-tutorial and post instruction examination scores. Results: All 36 potential participants (100%) completed the study curriculum. Students were divided equally between the CBL (n=18) and PBM (n=18) groups. Pre-tutorial exam scores (mean ± s.d.) were 44% ± 11.1% for the CBL group and 44% ± 10.8% for the PBL cohort, indicating no statistically significant differences (p > 0.05) between the two groups. After instruction, post-tutorial exam scores (mean ± s.d.) were increased from the pre-tutorial scores, 74% ± 11% and 67% ± 12%, for students in the CBL and the PBM groups, respectively. The improvement in post-tutorial exam scores from the pre-test scores was considered significant (p < 0.05). When post-test scores for the tutorial groups were compared, the CBL subjects achieved a score that was, on average, 7 percentage points higher than their PBM counterparts, a statistically significant difference (p < 0.05). Conclusion: Instruction by either CBL or PBM strategies is associated with improvements in newly acquired knowledge as reflected by increased post-tutorial examination scores. Students that received CBL had significantlyhigher post-tutorial exam scores than those in the PBM group, indicating that CBL is an effective instruction strategy in this setting.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.3402/meo.v13i.4482?needAccess=true,

Their impact on MS’s performance in exams however was not yet evaluated. Chatprogress is a chatbot-based game developed at Paris Descartes University. It contains 8 pulmonology cases with step-by-step answers delivered with pedagogical comments. The CHATPROGRESS study aimed to evaluate the impact of Chatprogress on students’ success rate in their end-term exams. Methods We conducted a post-test randomized controlled trial held on all fourth-year MS at Paris Descartes University. All MS were asked to follow the University’s regular lectures, and half of them were randomly given access to Chatprogress. At the end of the term, medical students were evaluated on pulmonology, cardiology and critical care medicine. Main outcomes measures The primary aim was to evaluate an increase in scores in the pulmonology sub-test for students who had access to Chatprogress, compared to those who didn’t. Secondary aims were to evaluate an increase in scores in the overall test (Pulmonology, Cardiology and Critical care medicine test (PCC)) and to evaluate the correlation between access to Chatprogress and overall test score. Finally, students’ satisfaction was assessed using a survey. Results From 10/2018 to 06/2019, 171 students had access to Chatprogress (the Gamers) and among them, 104 ended up using it (the Users). Gamers and Users were compared to 255 Controls with no access to Chatprogress. Differences in scores on the pulmonology sub-test over the academic year were significantly higher among Gamers and Users vs Controls (mean score: 12.7/20 vs 12.0/20, p = 0.0104 and mean score: 12.7/20 vs 12.0/20, p = 0.0365 respectively). This significant difference was present as well in the overall PCC test scores: (mean score: 12.5/20 vs 12.1/20, p = 0.0285 and 12.6/20 vs 12.1/20, p = 0.0355 respectively). Although no significant correlation was found between the pulmonology sub-test’s scores and MS’s assiduity parameters (number of finished games among the 8 proposed to Users and number of times a User finished a game), there was a trend to a better correlation when users were evaluated on a subject covered by Chatprogress. MS were also found to be fans of this teaching tool, asking for more pedagogical comments even when they got the questions right. Conclusion This randomised controlled trial is the first to demonstrate a significant improvement in students’ results (in both the pulmonology subtest and the overall PCC exam) when they had access to Chatbots, and even more so when they actually used it.",https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0278673&type=printable,

Many studies have shown this “student-centered” pedagogical model improves students' overall achievement in the course, with students showing more motivation and better self-directed learning skills when compared to the traditional classroom teaching. However, most of the previous studies have been evaluating the short-term effects of FC teaching conducted upon completion of the course. The retention of the promotion and the long-term effects on learning of students' subsequent courses deserve further attention and evaluation. By adopting and running FC teaching in the whole course of physiology, this study aimed to determine the short-term impact of FC teaching on students' learning of physiology course and also the long-term influences in students' learning of follow-up medical curriculums within 18 months after the completion of physiology course. 119 sophomore students majoring in clinical medicine from Central South University were recruited and they were assigned randomly into two groups: the control group (n =61) who received the traditional lecture (TL) teaching, and the experimental group (n =58), who received the FC teaching. In this study, students' final exam scores were used to assess their learning effectiveness and an independent samples t-test was conducted to compare scores between the two groups. Our study showed that FC teaching significantly improved the learning outcome of physiology in the experimental group compared with the control group (P = 0.0001) without obvious impact on the learning of other subjects conducted in the same period of time. Moreover, our results also demonstrated the long-term benefit of FC teaching, with students from the experimental group scoring higher in pathophysiology (P = 0.006), pathology (P = 0.029), pharmacology (P = 0.0089), diagnostics (P = 0.01) and internal medicine (P = 0.0004) than those from the control group. The study results indicate that FC is a promising teaching approach to increase students' learning effectiveness in physiology course, and the long-term effects of FC facilitate the learning of the follow-up medical courses. Furthermore, this study also demonstrates that although the time investment on physiology is increased by FC teaching, it does not weaken students' learning of other courses conducted in the same period of time.",https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpubh.2022.835810/pdf,

Using data from the National Survey of Student Engagement, Mr. Carini and Mr. Kuh find that the educational experiences of future teachers compare favorably with those of other students in college. However, these positive experiences do not necessarily stem from teacher education programs. SOONER OR LATER, discussions of schooling turn to teacher quality. Both educational leaders and the general public agree that high-quality teachers are a key to boosting student achievement.1 Why might we not have the high-quality teachers we need? Two reasons dominate the debate. The first is self-selection -- the academic ability of those who choose to teach is thought to be a cut (or more) below that of peers headed to other vocations. Second, teacher preparation programs supposedly lack intellectual rigor and don't cultivate certain critical skills and competencies in their students. Though the evidence supporting these claims is far from conclusive,2 universities and policy makers seem determined to upgrade teacher quality. One popular approach is to raise the bar for entry into teacher preparation programs by requiring higher minimum college grades or higher scores on entrance exams. This strategy recalls the specious criteria used in many annual rankings of colleges and universities in which higher scores on such input measures as entrance tests and more resources for faculty salaries or in an endowment yield higher ""quality"" rankings for the university. The public remains mesmerized by such ranking schemes, despite decades of research on college-level learning that point to a very different conclusion. Indeed, studies show that what matters far more to learning and a host of other desired outcomes during college is what students do with their time and how they use the institution's educational resources, not the test scores they bring to college or the resources a school has. Equally important, scores on college entrance tests and even such outcome measures as the Praxis I and II exams don't tell us what we should focus on to enhance teacher preparation, because it isn't clear which institutional policies or practices affect the outcomes of interest. Looking Behind Test Scores and Outcomes The best predictor of learning and personal development for college students is the amount of time and energy they expend on educationally fruitful activities.3 For example, the more students study or practice, the more they learn or the better they become at something. How can we find out whether students are doing these and other productive activities during college? Process indicators are one potentially instructive source of information. These are measures that represent effective educational practices -- student and institutional behaviors that theory and research show are empirically linked to desired outcomes.4 The argument goes like this: future teachers who are challenged more academically during college or who have considerable firsthand experience in educationally meaningful pursuits, such as active and collaborative learning or classes that demand the use of higher-order thinking skills, will tend to be more effective teachers after college because they will learn more during college and will be well positioned to use similar strategies in their own teaching.5 Consider service learning, which is linked to a host of desirable outcomes.6 If we think of service learning as ""a teaching strategy that connects community service with the curriculum,""7 it stands to reason that teachers who've had this experience during college will be better prepared to use this and allied instructional strategies in their own classrooms when they begin teaching. If teacher education programs had valid, reliable process indicators, then faculty members and others could diagnose in which areas prospective teachers were underperforming relative to established standards or compared with their peers in other fields. …",https://scholarworks.iu.edu/bitstreams/3beb9dcd-c99a-4f04-b47a-c1dd03a13dab/download,

These models, including Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPT)-3.5 (OpenAI), GPT-4 (OpenAI), and Bard (Google LLC), find applications beyond natural language processing, attracting interest from academia and industry. Students are actively leveraging LLMs to enhance learning experiences and prepare for high-stakes exams, such as the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET) in India. Objective This comparative analysis aims to evaluate the performance of GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and Bard in answering NEET-2023 questions. Methods In this paper, we evaluated the performance of the 3 mainstream LLMs, namely GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and Google Bard, in answering questions related to the NEET-2023 exam. The questions of the NEET were provided to these artificial intelligence models, and the responses were recorded and compared against the correct answers from the official answer key. Consensus was used to evaluate the performance of all 3 models. Results It was evident that GPT-4 passed the entrance test with flying colors (300/700, 42.9%), showcasing exceptional performance. On the other hand, GPT-3.5 managed to meet the qualifying criteria, but with a substantially lower score (145/700, 20.7%). However, Bard (115/700, 16.4%) failed to meet the qualifying criteria and did not pass the test. GPT-4 demonstrated consistent superiority over Bard and GPT-3.5 in all 3 subjects. Specifically, GPT-4 achieved accuracy rates of 73% (29/40) in physics, 44% (16/36) in chemistry, and 51% (50/99) in biology. Conversely, GPT-3.5 attained an accuracy rate of 45% (18/40) in physics, 33% (13/26) in chemistry, and 34% (34/99) in biology. The accuracy consensus metric showed that the matching responses between GPT-4 and Bard, as well as GPT-4 and GPT-3.5, had higher incidences of being correct, at 0.56 and 0.57, respectively, compared to the matching responses between Bard and GPT-3.5, which stood at 0.42. When all 3 models were considered together, their matching responses reached the highest accuracy consensus of 0.59. Conclusions The study’s findings provide valuable insights into the performance of GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and Bard in answering NEET-2023 questions. GPT-4 emerged as the most accurate model, highlighting its potential for educational applications. Cross-checking responses across models may result in confusion as the compared models (as duos or a trio) tend to agree on only a little over half of the correct responses. Using GPT-4 as one of the compared models will result in higher accuracy consensus. The results underscore the suitability of LLMs for high-stakes exams and their positive impact on education. Additionally, the study establishes a benchmark for evaluating and enhancing LLMs’ performance in educational tasks, promoting responsible and informed use of these models in diverse learning environments.",https://doi.org/10.2196/51523,

Problem-based learning (PBL) is an approach that focuses on students’ solving a problem through collaborative groups. There were eighty samples involved in this study. The samples were divided into three groups: ICT integrated with PBL group: a PBL group, and a lecture group. The PBL with Information and Communication Technology (ICT) group used a PBL module integrated with the following ICT elements: Microsoft Word template; Microsoft PowerPoint; electronic discussion group, and blog. Meanwhile the PBL group used the PBL module alongside log books and posters. The control group utilized the lecture method. All these groups went through four sessions of Biology. Before the beginning of session one and after the fourth session, an achievement test was given to all the students. Based on the analysis for MANOVA with repeated measure 3x2x2, the main effect for type of treatment, exam time and subscale was found significantly different. Additionally, the type of treatment interacts with exam time and subscale in contributing towards the achievement test scores.

In response, primarily based on expert consensus, medical schools have supplemented their curricula with standardized patient (SP) sessions that are focused on the neurologic examination. Hypothesis-driven quantitative data are needed to justify the further use of this resource-intensive educational modality, specifically regarding whether using SPs to teach the neurological examination effects a long-term benefit on the application of neurological examination skills. Methods: This study is a cross-sectional analysis of prospectively collected data from medical students at Weill Cornell Medical College. The control group (n=129) received the standard curriculum. The intervention group (n=58) received the standard curriculum and an additional SP session focused on the neurologic examination during the second year of medical school. Student performance on the neurologic examination was assessed in the control and intervention groups via an OSCE administered during the fourth year of medical school. A Neurologic Physical Exam (NPE) score of 0.0 to 6.0 was calculated for each student based on a neurologic examination checklist completed by the SPs during the OSCE. Composite NPE scores in the control and intervention groups were compared with the unpaired t-test. Results: In the fourth year OSCE, composite NPE scores in the intervention group (3.5±1.1) were statistically significantly greater than those in the control group (2.2±1.1) (p<0.0001). Conclusions: SP sessions are an effective tool for teaching the neurologic examination. We determined that a single, structured SP session conducted as an adjunct to our traditional lectures and small groups is associated with a statistically significant improvement in student performance measured 2 years after the session.",https://europepmc.org/articles/pmc3022729?pdf=render,

The use of this activity can allow the students to feel more involved in the subjects covered and may improve their knowledge and learning. The aim of this study was to identify the effect of question-writing activity as a stimulus factor on learning in midwifery students and determine their perception about this activity. Methods: This quasi-experimental study with two groups of pre- and post-tests was conducted on two groups of midwifery students who had taken the immunology course. Two classes of midwifery students (N=62) participated and were randomly assigned to two different groups. One class was selected as the experimental group (n=32) and the other class was considered as the control group (n=30). The experimental group’s students were asked to write questions covering different topics of the syllabus components taught during 15 weeks from February 2016 to May 2016. They were asked to write, answer and explain their multiple-choice questions (MCQs). The students’ performance in immunology course was compared between the two groups at the end of the semester. After their final exam, we asked them to fill in a questionnaire on their views about this activity. The data were analyzed by independent t- test using SPSS software, version 18. Results: The differences between pre- and post-test mean scores of the experimental and control groups were 24.53±5.74 and 20.63±5.58, respectively.

However, the assumption that the content presented in these courses will improve learning in later courses has not been verified. Because a direct comparison of performance between students with and without required prerequisites is logistically difficult to arrange in a randomized fashion, we developed a novel familiarity scale, and used this to determine whether concepts introduced in a prerequisite course improved student learning in a later course (in two biology disciplines). Exam questions in the latter courses were classified into three categories, based on the degree to which the tested concept had been taught in the prerequisite course. If content familiarity mattered, it would be expected that exam scores on topics covered in the prerequisite would be higher than scores on novel topics. We found this to be partially true for “Very Familiar” questions (concepts covered in depth in the prerequisite). However, scores for concepts only briefly discussed in the prerequisite (“Familiar”) were indistinguishable from performance on topics that were “Not Familiar” (concepts only taught in the later course). These results imply that merely “covering” topics in a prerequisite course does not result in improved future performance, and that some topics may be able to removed from a course thereby freeing up class time. Our results may therefore support the implementation of student-centered teaching methods such as active learning, as the time-intensive nature of active learning has been cited as a barrier to its adoption. In addition, we propose that our familiarity system could be broadly utilized to aid in the assessment of the effectiveness of prerequisites.",https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0148051&type=printable,

Multiple choice questions (MCQs) are a common format in medical exams and are used by students to prepare for said exams. Objective We aimed to examine whether particular learning activities contributed more strongly than others to users’ exam performance. Methods We analyzed data from users of an online platform that provides learning materials for medical students in preparation for their final exams. We analyzed whether the number of learning cards viewed and the number of MCQs taken were positively related to learning outcomes. We also examined whether viewing learning cards or answering MCQs was more effective. Finally, we tested whether taking individual notes predicted learning outcomes, and whether taking notes had an effect after controlling for the effects of learning cards and MCQs. Our analyses from the online platform Amboss are based on user activity data, which supplied the number of learning cards studied and test questions answered. We also included the number of notes from each of those 23,633 users who had studied at least 200 learning cards and had answered at least 1000 test exam questions in the 180 days before their state exam. The activity data for this analysis was collected retrospectively, using Amboss archival usage data from April 2014 to April 2017. Learning outcomes were measured using the final state exam scores that were calculated by using the answers voluntarily entered by the participants. Results We found correlations between the number of cards studied (r=.22; P<.001) and the number of test questions that had been answered (r=.23; P<.001) with the percentage of correct answers in the learners’ medical exams. The number of test questions answered still yielded a significant effect, even after controlling for the number of learning cards studied using a hierarchical regression analysis (β=.14; P<.001; ΔR2=.017; P<.001). We found a negative interaction between the number of learning cards and MCQs, indicating that users with high scores for learning cards and MCQs had the highest exam scores. Those 8040 participants who had taken at least one note had a higher percentage of correct answers (80.94%; SD=7.44) than those who had not taken any notes (78.73%; SD=7.80; t23631=20.95; P<.001). In a stepwise regression, the number of notes the participants had taken predicted the percentage of correct answers over and above the effect of the number of learning cards studied and of the number of test questions entered in step one (β=.06; P<.001; ΔR2=.004; P<.001).

Being able to show the relevance of Mathematics in an everyday situation, teaching students to remember mathematical facts, and showing them lots of worked examples were mentioned by most of the teachers as indicators of effective Mathematics teaching practices. Together with these indicators, preparing the lesson before teaching, providing exercises and homework to students, and making research to update teachers’ teaching skills have been drawn and recommended for teachers as potentially effective teaching practices.",https://www.scielo.br/j/bolema/a/YBFLXFrXv7KWQWYNm6BjN4B/?lang=en&format=pdf,

In the undergraduate medical education system in India, curricular guidelines of Medical Council of India lay emphasis on methods of assessment of knowledge and skills in pharmacology.[1] Although continuous formative assessment constitutes an integral part in the curriculum, the ‘pass’ and the ‘fail’ certificates are based to a great extent on students’ performance in the final summative examination. The final examination consists of written papers, viva-voce sessions and practical exercises. Written examination consists of two papers. Each paper has the maximum marks of 40 and contains structured essay type questions and short notes. In viva-voce examination, each student is assessed by five examiners; two of them external examiners and the others internal examiners. In order to pass, a candidate must obtain 50% marks in aggregate with a minimum of 50% marks in written and viva together and a minimum of 50% marks in practical examination.[1] The written examination is a useful evaluation format that not only tests students’ ability to recall facts, but also can assess higher-order cognitive functions, such as interpretation of data and problem solving skills. The viva-voce examination on the other hand is a general encounter between a candidate and one or more examiners.[2] Viva-voce examinations are less reliable as they are essentially subjective in nature, afflicted with ‘halo effects’, errors of central tendency, a general tendency toward leniency, and errors of contrast.[2] Examiners mostly indulge in over-marking in viva-voce examinations in order to make an otherwise undeserving candidate ‘pass’. We explored this recently in a small questionnaire-based interview among examiners of pharmacology in one university and the examiners admitted showing such ‘leniency’. Against this backdrop, we planned the present study to compare students’ performance in written and viva-voce components of the final summative pharmacology examination in MBBS curriculum in order to have a critical insight into the two modes of evaluation, the way they are practiced. This was a record-based observational study done in a medical college in India that also served as an examination centre for second professional MBBS examination in pharmacology for four consecutive years, from 2008 to 2011. The performance of students was assessed. Permission for access to the students’ score sheets was obtained from appropriate authority and confidentiality of individual student’s score was maintained. Percentage of marks obtained by four batches of students (n=589), in consecutive years (2008-11), in written and viva-voce components of the final summative examination in pharmacology were reviewed: Batch 1 (Jan 2011 Exam, n=159), Batch 2 (Jan 2010 Exam, n=139), Batch 3 (Jan 2009 Exam, n=148), Batch 4 (Jan 2008 Exam, n=143). Based on their performance in terms of percentage of marks in aggregate, all students in a batch were classified into four categories viz., ‘failed’(F) – <50%, ‘borderline passed’ (BP) – 50-57%, ‘passed’ (P) – >57% to <75% and ‘passed with distinction’ (PD) – ≥75%. Correlation was assessed between the percentage of marks obtained by students in these categories in written vis-a-vis viva-voce examination. Highly significant association was observed in marks obtained by students in P and PD categories in all four batches in viva-voce and written examination (P<0.001). However, no significant association was observed in marks obtained by students in F and BP categories in all four batches in viva-voce and written examination (P>0.05). The results are shown in Table 1. Interestingly, no student in F category got 50% marks in written examination, but most of them scored satisfactorily in the viva-voce. Among all the students in F category, three students in 2008, five in 2009, four in 2010 and none in 2011 failed in practical examination. The number of students in each category (e.g., F, BP, P and PD) when compared among the 4 years (2008-11) did not show any significant difference [Figure 1]. Our study showed that there was highly significant association between written and viva-voce marks of students in the PD and P categories (P<0.001). We interpret this as the ‘true’ reflection of knowledge and competence of the students in this category. Our study also revealed that there was a lack of significant association in performance in written and viva-voce examination among students in F and BP categories (P>0.05). Marks obtained by students in viva-voce were higher with respect to those in written examination in these two categories. Rather, the poorer the performance in written examination, the higher the marks obtained in the viva-voce. Such trend is most prominent in the F category of students Access this article online",https://europepmc.org/articles/pmc3326931,

Visual models have the potential to enhance learning environments by providing visual representations of complex mechanisms. Despite their benefits, the use of visual models in undergraduate classrooms is still limited. For this study, we tested the effect of a learning sequence of activities related to the cardiac cycle using an augmented reality (AR) application for smartphones and tablets. We were interested in understanding the ability of students to draw and label figures reflecting cardiac function after experiencing the learning sequence using AR. Undergraduate students of the biomedical sciences (control n = 43, experimental n = 58) were enrolled in the course, and their drawings were evaluated using multiple levels of complexity (1 = basic to 5 = complex) through a pre-/posttest structure that included a learning sequence based on AR in the experimental group and regular lecture-based activities in the control group. The complexity of students' drawings was evaluated on the anatomical, physiological, and molecular aspects of heart contraction. We used Cohen's kappa index for interrater reliability when determining the complexity of drawings. Control and experimental groups showed no differences in baseline knowledge (preexamination quiz). The students who experienced the AR activities showed an increase in the complexity of representation levels in posttest results and also showed a significant difference in scores for the final exam in the heart physiology course.

Students in majors unrelated to physics scored 60% lower on the written analytic part of the final than they did as freshmen. The mean score of all students on conceptual multiple choice questions included on the final declined by approximately 50% relative to the scores of freshmen. The mean score of all participants on the MBT was insignificantly changed from the posttest taken as freshmen. More specifically, however, the students’ performance on 9 of the 26 MBT items (with 6 of the 9 involving graphical kinematics) represents a gain over their freshman pretest score (a normalized gain of about 70%, double the gain achieved in the freshman course alone), while their performance on the remaining 17 questions is best characterized as a loss of approximately 50% of the material learned in the freshman course.

However, multiple studies show that medical school curriculum often fails to adequately prepare graduates to diagnose and manage common MSK problems. Current standardised exams inadequately assess trainees’ MSK knowledge and other MSK-specific exams such as Freedman and Bernstein’s (1998) exam have limitations in implementation. We propose a new 30-question multiple choice exam for graduating medical students and primary care residents. Results highlight individual deficiencies and identify areas for curriculum improvement. Methods/Results We developed a bank of multiple choice questions based on 10 critical topics in MSK medicine. The questions were validated with subject-matter experts (SMEs) using a modified Delphi method to obtain consensus on the importance of each question. Based on the SME input, we compiled 30 questions in the assessment. Results of the large-scale pilot test (167 post-clerkship medical students) were an average score of 74 % (range 53% – 90 %, SD 7.8%). In addition, the tool contains detailed explanations and references were created for each question to allow an individual or group to review and enhance learning. Summary The proposed MSK30 exam evaluates clinically important topics and offers an assessment tool for clinical MSK knowledge of medical students and residents. It fills a gap in current curriculum and improves on previous MSK-specific assessments through better clinical relevance and consistent grading. Educators can use the results of the exam to guide curriculum development and individual education.",https://bmjopensem.bmj.com/content/bmjosem/5/1/e000495.full.pdf,

This study explored the impact of blended versus offline case-centered learning on academic performance of Medical Nursing and critical thinking ability among undergraduate nursing students.Methods: A cluster randomized controlled study design was used, with assessments immediately before and one school year after the intervention. All the second-year undergraduate nursing students in two class were enrolled in this study by cluster sampling. The two classes of Medical Nursing were randomly allocated to either the experimental class, which undertook blended case-centered learning, or the control class, which undertook offline case-centered learning. The primary outcomes were academic performance consisting of final exam and process assessment, as well as the critical thinking ability assessed with the Critical Thinking Disposition Inventory-Chinese Version (CTDI-CV). The Mann-Whitney U test and the unpaired t test was subsequently used. ANCOVA analyses were also performed to examine the two teaching methods’ effect on academic performance and critical thinking.Results: Students in the experimental class showed a significantly higher improvement in academic performance of Medical Nursing than the control class. In addition, compared with the control class, the pre-post difference in competency in critical thinking self-confidence in the experimental class was significantly greater (p=0.037).

The utility of using Twitter for curriculum content delivery has not been studied. We sought to determine if participation in a social media-based educational supplement would improve student performance on a test of clinical images at the end of the semester. Methods 116 second-year medical students were enrolled in a lecture-based clinical medicine course, in which images of common clinical exam findings were presented. An additional, optional assessment was performed on Twitter. Each week, a clinical presentation and physical exam image (not covered in course lectures) were distributed via Twitter, and students were invited to guess the exam finding or diagnosis. After the completion of the course, students were asked to participate in a slideshow “quiz” with 24 clinical images, half from lecture and half from Twitter. Results We conducted a one-way analysis of variance to determine the effect Twitter participation had on total, Twitter-only, and lecture-only scores. Twitter participation data was collected from the end-of-course survey and was defined as submitting answers to the Twitter-only questions “all or most of the time”, “about half of the time”, and “little or none of the time.” We found a significant difference in overall scores (p<0.001) and in Twitter-only scores (p<0.001). There was not enough evidence to conclude a significant difference in lecture-only scores (p=0.124). Students who submitted answers to Twitter “all or most of the time” or “about half the time” had significantly higher overall scores and Twitter-only scores (p<0.001 and p<0.001, respectively) than those students who only submitted answers “little or none of the time.” Conclusion While students retained less information from Twitter than from traditional classroom lecture, some retention was noted. Future research on social media in medical education would benefit from clear control and experimental groups in settings where quantitative use of social media could be measured.

This type of education is significant because it ensures that all students receive the required learning. The statistical evaluations are limited in providing good predictions of the university’s e-learning quality. That is forcing many universities to go to online and blended learning environments. This paper presents an approach of statistical analysis to identify the most common factors that affect the students’ performance and then use artificial neural networks (ANNs) to predict students’ performance within the blended learning environment of Saudi Electronic University (SEU). Accordingly, this dissertation generated a dataset from SEU’s Blackboard learning management system. The student’s performance can be tested using a set of factors: the studying (face-to-face or virtual), percentage of attending live lectures, midterm exam scores, and percentage of solved assessments. The results showed that the four factors are responsible for academic performance. After that, we proposed a new ANN model to predict the students’ performance depending on the four factors. Firefly Algorithm (FFA) was used for training the ANNs. The proposed model’s performance will be evaluated through different statistical tests, such as error functions, statistical hypothesis tests, and ANOVA tests.",https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/14/18/11642/pdf?version=1663325683,

Research concerning the testing effect has demonstrated that utilizing testing as a study strategy leads to higher performance and more accurate confidence compared to more common study strategies such as rereading or reviewing homework problems. We report on three experiments that explore the viability of using computer adaptive testing (CAT) for assessing students’ physics proficiency, for preparing students for midterm exams by diagnosing their weaknesses, and for predicting scores in midterm exams in an introductory calculus-based mechanics course for science and engineering majors. The first two experiments evaluated the reliability and validity of the CAT algorithm. In addition, we investigated the ability of the CAT test to predict performance on the midterm exam. The third experiment explored whether completing two CAT tests in the days before a midterm exam would facilitate performance on the midterm exam. Scores on the CAT tests and the midterm exams were significantly correlated and, on average, were not statistically different from each other. This provides evidence for moderate parallel-forms reliability and criterion-related validity of the CAT algorithm. In addition, when used as a diagnostic tool, CAT showed promise in helping students perform better on midterm exams. Finally, we found that the CAT tests predicted the average performance on the midterm exams reasonably well, however, the CAT tests were not as accurate as desired at predicting the performance of individual students. While CAT shows promise for practice testing, more research is needed to refine testing algorithms to increase reliability before implementing CAT for summative evaluations. In light of these findings, we believe that more research is needed comparing CAT to traditional paper-and-pencil practice tests in order to determine whether the effort needed to create a CAT system is worthwhile.",http://link.aps.org/pdf/10.1103/PhysRevPhysEducRes.14.020110,

Rationale Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) accredited residency programs report the United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE) Step 1 and Comprehensive Osteopathic Licensing Examination-USA (COMLEX-USA) Level 1 scores as the most important criteria in selecting candidates to interview. Hypotheses (1) Certain resources are superior for exam preparation. (2) Certain practice tests better assess exam preparedness. (3) USMLE performance will correlate with the COMLEX-USA. Methods One-hundred and two (102) medical students were surveyed regarding preparation for and performance on COMLEX-USA Level 1 and USMLE Step 1. Results USMLE-specific question banks were positively correlated with performance on COMLEX-USA Level 1 and USMLE Step 1 while COMLEX-specific question banks showed no correlation.

METHODS In a cross-sectional study, an ad hoc questionnaire was delivered to a sample of BH first-year university students. The following data were collected: socio-demographic features, consumption of neuroenchancing substances, the Westside Test Anxiety Scale (WTAS) and academic performance. RESULTS A total of 214 students were included. Consumption of lifestyle substances, coffee, energy drinks, nicotine, alcohol, and marijuana, for the purpose of neuroenhancement increased during the week before the exams. OTC cognitive enhancer use was reported by 31.0%, and of benzodiazepines by 1.5% of students. No psycostimulants were used. A high to extremely high exam WTAS score was reported in 38.3% students. The exam WTAS score was positively correlated with consumption of coffee (rho=0.31; P<0.001), energy drinks (rho=0.18; P=0.009), and nicotine (rho=0.22; P=0.001), and negatively correlated with last exam grade (rho=-0.33; P<0.001). The exam WTAS score was a significant independent predictor (OR=0.55; 95% CI 0.31 to 0.97, P=0.039) for self-assessed academic performance. Self-assessed academic performance was positively correlated with last exam grade (rho=0.15; P=0.043). CONCLUSIONS Although first-year BH university students do not seem to use either prescription or illicit psycostimulants, the consumption of nicotine, alcohol, and marijuana is worrying. However, the consumption of these neuroenhancing substances seems not to be related to better self-assessed academic performance.

To achieve this goal, we propose a metacognitive approach that integrates basic science with the humanistic and health system aspects of medical education. Intervention: During the week, via problem-based learning and lectures, first-year medical students were taught the basic science underlying a disease. Each Friday, a patient with the disease spoke to the class. Students then wrote illness scripts, which required them to metacognitively reflect not only on disease pathophysiology, complications, and treatments but also on the humanistic and health system issues revealed during the patient encounter. Evaluation of the intervention was conducted by measuring results on course exams and national board exams and analyzing free responses on the illness scripts and student course feedback. The course exams and National Board of Medical Examiners questions were divided into 3 categories: content covered in lecture, problem-based learning, or patient + illness script. Comparisons were made using Student t-test. Free responses were inductively analyzed using grounded theory methodology. Context: This curricular intervention was implemented during the first 13-week basic science course of medical school. The main objective of the course, Scientific Principles of Medicine, is to lay the scientific foundation for subsequent organ system courses. A total of 150 students were enrolled each year. We evaluated this intervention over 2 years, totaling 300 students. Outcome: Students scored significantly higher on illness script content compared to lecture content on the course exams (mean difference = 11.1, P = .006) and national board exams given in December (mean difference = 21.8, P = .0002) and June (mean difference = 12.7, P = .016). Themes extracted from students’ free responses included the following: relevance of basic science, humanistic themes of empathy, resilience, and the doctor-patient relationship, and systems themes of cost, barriers to care, and support systems. Lessons learned: A metacognitive approach to learning through the use of patient encounters and illness script reflections creates stronger conceptual frameworks for students to integrate, store, retain, and retrieve knowledge.",https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/2382120518777770,

Two methods for the ongoing evaluation of student learning were analyzed for differences in learning outcomes as demonstrated by mid-term and final exam test scores. Using an experimental design, students that enrolled in either a Disease Control course or an Epidemiology course were randomized into one of two sections in each course. Holding the course parameters the same except for the weekly evaluation type (homework or quiz), bivariate analysis using independent t tests supported that sections were similar in both courses with respect to test scores. A statistically significant difference did occur between final exam scores in the Disease Control course with the higher scores occurring in the quiz section. End of course student satisfaction surveys were similar for both types of evaluation methods and for both courses. Of the students that responded to the surveys, the majority felt their overall learning experience was either good or very good, regardless of whether they completed weekly interactive homework assignments or automated quizzes. This study supports the idea that learning outcomes and student satisfaction scores with a weekly automated quiz are equivalent or improved over the more interactive weekly homework assignments in select courses.

Good sleep quality and physical activity improve the mental ability and academic performance of the students. Objectives and rationale The study aims to assess sleep quality and physical activity levels among fourth-year MBBS students of Rawalpindi Medical University. We compare these levels with gender and boarding status and correlate them with the academic performance of the students. This may provide new target areas to improve the academics of students performing below average. Materials and methods It was a descriptive, cross-sectional study conducted in March 2019 on 344 medical students enrolled in the fourth-year MBBS class of Rawalpindi Medical University. Sleep quality was assessed by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), physical activity levels by the Global Physical Activity Questionnaire (GPAQ), and academic performance by the marks attained in the most recent pathology class test. The students who could not prepare for the test in the usual manner were excluded from the study. Two-hundred nineteen (219) students were part of the final study sample. Data analysis was performed using SPSS v.22.0 (IBM Corp, Armonk, NY, US). A chi-squared test, independent samples t-test, Pearson’s correlation, and a multiple linear regression model were used to assess the variables. Results Sleep quality and physical activity were significantly correlated with academic performance (p-values of the chi-square and t-test were <0.000). Pearson’s correlation coefficient was -0.69 for PSQI (p<0.000) and 0.62 for GPAQ (p 0.003) with test scores. Gender showed significant association with sleep and physical activity levels (male students had better physical activity level and poorer sleep quality than female students) but no association with test scores. Boarding status was significantly associated with all three variables. Boarders had lower mean test scores and poorer sleep and physical activity indices as compared to non-boarders. The multiple linear regression model was valid (p-value of the F test was <0.000), with beta coefficients of -2.53 ( p=0.002) for sleep quality and 1.37 (p=0.01) for physical activity. The R2 value was 0.84 (84%). Conclusions Our study indicates an overall poor sleep quality and physical activity level among fourth-year medical students, particularly boarding students, who have lower test scores and worse sleep and physical activity levels. In general, male students have better GPAQ scores and female students have better PSQI scores. Both the PSQI and GPAQ scores are significantly correlated with test scores and provide potential target areas to improve the exam performance of the students.",https://www.cureus.com/articles/20835-association-of-physical-activity-and-sleep-quality-with-academic-performance-among-fourth-year-mbbs-students-of-rawalpindi-medical-university.pdf,

Design This was a prospective, quantitative, nonrandomized study. Participants were medical residents in physical medicine and rehabilitation from two affiliated programs and graduate students in speech language pathology from two instructional cohorts at a single institution. Group 1, traditional group (n=51), participated in F2F lectures using an audience response system, whereas Group 2, online group (n=57), participated in an online, interactive course. The main outcome measure was pre- and post-course FEES knowledge test scores. Results For Group 1, the mean pre-course score was 26.94 (SD=3.24) and the post-course score was 34.96 (SD=2.51). Differences between pre- and post-course scores for Group 1 were significant (t=−16.38, P≤0.0001). For Group 2, the mean pre-course score was 27.05 (SD=2.74) and the post-course score was 34.05 (SD=2.84). Differences between pre- and post-course scores for Group 2 were significant (t=−13.5, P≤0.0001). The mean knowledge change score for Group 1 and Group 2 was 8.01 (SD=3.50) and 7.04 (SD=3.91), respectively (nonsignificant, t=1.372, P=0.173), suggesting groups made similar gains. Conclusion Incorporating technology into GME and GSLP programs yielded comparable gains to traditional lectures. Findings support the use of online education as a viable alternative to the traditional F2F classroom format for the instruction of the cognitive component of the FEES procedure.",https://www.dovepress.com/getfile.php?fileID=42572,

An audience response system called SIDRA (Immediate Audience Response System in Spanish) and two audience response systems with gamification features, R-G-SIDRA (gamified SIDRA with ranking) and RB-G-SIDRA (gamified SIDRA with ranking and badges), were used in a General and Descriptive Human Anatomy course. Students participated in an empirical study. In the academic year 2019–2020, a total of 90 students used RB-G-SIDRA, 90 students employed R-G-SIDRA in the academic year 2018–2019, and 92 students used SIDRA in the academic year 2017–2018.

The purpose of the admission process in the graduate physical therapy (PT) program is to evaluate information that can predict an individual’s potential for success in the program. To date there is no reliable way to predict clinical performance of physical therapy students. Emotional intelligence has been shown to predict clinical performance in other medical professions and may be a predictor for clinical performance in PT. Generic abilities of clinical performance are critically important in the PT profession and are evaluated using the Clinical Performance Instrument (CPI). This study examined the relationship between clinical performance and emotional intelligence. Subjects. Fifty-six graduate physical therapy students (46 female, 10 male) between the ages of 23 to 38 years (25.7 + 3.6 years) from four Eastern Massachusetts schools participated. Methods. Clinical Performance Instrument (CPI) scores (version 4), the Mayer-Salovey-Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test (MSCEIT version 2.0)scores, Graduate Record Exam (GRE) scores, pre-requisite grade point averages (GPAs) and demographic information were collected. Results. Total CPI score (R2 = 0.36, p <0.02) and scores on individual items of Professional behavior (R2 = 0.31), Performing Interventions (R2 = 0.35, p < 0.04) and Performing an Examination (R2 = 0.28) were not significantly related to emotional intelligence. Emotional intelligence was not significantly related to GRE scores (r =.14, p = 0.31) or pre-requisite school GPA (r = 0.10, p = 0.46). Discussion and Conclusion. Within the limitations of this research, the MSCEIT did not prove to be a successful predictor either by itself or in combination with other variables in predicting CPI performance. Future work with emotional intelligence surveys as predictors of CPI performance should start with examining those who pass the clinical experience part of the PT program compared to those who do not. After understanding the relationship between success and failure on the CPI, an examination of those that score high on the CPI versus those that merely pass could be studied.",https://doi.org/10.46743/1540-580x/2010.1318,

This study aimed to investigate application of Direct Observation of Procedural Skills (DOPS) in undergraduate medical students. Methods: This is a cross sectional study conducted during emergency ward rotation in last year medical students using consensus sampling method. Each student performed 2 procedures at least twice under the observation of 2 assessors using modified DOPS rating scales designed for each procedure simultaneously. Correlation between DOPS score and final routine exam was measured. Face and content validity was determined by the panel of experts. Moreover, through the test-retest and inter-rater reliability, the correlation of each score and total score was investigated. The spent time was calculated too. The statistical analysis was carried out using SPSS version 18. Results: Totally 60 students did 240 procedures under DOPS. The face and content validity confirmed by an expert panel. The findings showed that there was a significant correlation between the scores of each test and the total DOPS score (r1=0.736**, r2=0.793**, r3=0.564**, r4=0.685**; p<0.001). There was a significant correlation between the first and second scores of doing the same procedure (Pearson Cor.=0.74, p<0.001) and also between the scores of the two individual examiners when observing the same procedure (Pearson Cor.=0.84-0.94 p<0.001). The results showed that there was no correlation (Pearson Correlation =0.018, p<0.89) between the scores of this test and the final routine ward exam scores. The average time for doing DOPS test and the average time for providing feedback were 11.17 Max and 9.2 4.5 Min, respectively. Conclusion: The use of novel performance assessment methods such as DOPS is highly beneficial in order to ensure the adequacy of learning in medical students and assess their readiness for accepting professional responsibilities.

Older adults often require distinctive assessment, treatment and disposition. Emergency medicine (EM) residents should develop expertise and efficiency in geriatric care. Older adults represent over 25% of most emergency department (ED) volumes. Yet many EM residencies lack curricula or assessment tools for competent geriatric care. Fully educating residents in emergency geriatric care can demand large amounts of limited conference time. The Geriatric Emergency Medicine Competencies (GEMC) are high-impact geriatric topics developed to help residencies efficiently and effectively meet this training demand. This study examines if a 2-hour didactic intervention can significantly improve resident knowledge in 7 key domains as identified by the GEMC across multiple programs. Methods A validated 29-question didactic test was administered at six EM residencies before and after a GEMC-focused lecture delivered in summer and fall of 2009. We analyzed scores as individual questions and in defined topic domains using a paired student t test. Results A total of 301 exams were administered; 86 to PGY1, 88 to PGY2, 86 to PGY3, and 41 to PGY4 residents. The testing of didactic knowledge before and after the GEMC educational intervention had high internal reliability (87.9%). The intervention significantly improved scores in all 7 GEMC domains (improvement 13.5% to 34.6%; p<0.001). For all questions, the improvement was 23% (37.8% pre, 60.8% post; P<0.001) Graded increase in geriatric knowledge occurred by PGY year with the greatest improvement post intervention seen at the PGY 3 level (PGY1 19.1% versus PGY3 27.1%). Conclusion A brief GEMC intervention had a significant impact on EM resident knowledge of critical geriatric topics. Lectures based on the GEMC can be a high-yield tool to enhance resident knowledge of geriatric emergency care. Formal GEMC curriculum should be considered in training EM residents for the demands of an aging population.",https://escholarship.org/content/qt7qh10336/qt7qh10336.pdf?t=ntdret,
