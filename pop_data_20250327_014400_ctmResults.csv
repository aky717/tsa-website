Although the largest remaining extent of these forests is reported to be found in Mozambique, very little is known on their extent, condition and composition here. In addition, the term 'coastal forest' has been used in different ways by different authors. This paper defines and characterises coastal dry forests found in northern Mozambique and assesses their present extent, botanical composition, conservation importance and the threats to these forests. Methods - The study area of 18,150 km2 lies in Cabo Delgado Province in north-east Mozambique, adjacent to Tanzania. Its limits are determined primarily by geological substrate and landform. Four smaller study sites were chosen covering a range of landforms. Manual interpretation of satellite imagery dating from 1999-2002 was used to calculate possible previous and present extent of 'dense vegetation'. Extensive field collecting was used in determining botanical composition and distribution patterns. IUCN Red List assessments were carried out on selected species using distributional criteria. Results - Dry forests similar to those in southern Tanzania are found widely scattered across coastal Cabo Delgado, sitting in a matrix of miombo woodland and other vegetation types. However, forest cover is not as extensive was believed. We calculate that the original extent of 'dense vegetation cover', which includes coastal dry forest, was 6087 km2. Owing to clearance over the last 150 years this is now only 1182 km2, of which perhaps only 400 km2 is moderately-intact dry forest. In this southern part of their range such forests are essentially dry, not moist and mesic, and dominated by a high proportion of deciduous or sclerophyllous evergreen trees. The plant species composition differs significantly from that of the surrounding woodlands. There is a marked change in species composition between forest patches along the coast, and they contain numerous species with restricted global distribution. Since 2003, 68 species new to Mozambique have been recorded from Cabo Delgado in addition to 36 possible new species. Many new records are of species previously only known from south-eastern Tanzania. Previously recorded patterns of restricted distribution and high species turnover between forest patches in Kenya and Tanzania are confirmed. Seven coastal forest species were assessed as Endangered. Regional context and conservation - Coastal dry forests are discussed in relation to the more widespread 'sand forests' of the continental interior of south-central Africa, and shown to have similarities in ecology, species composition, soils and ecology. Very little of the present extent of coastal forests in Mozambique lies within protected areas. The threats to their continued existence in the face of exploitation for timber, agriculture and oil exploration are outlined.","Small forest fragments are common in anthropogenic landscapes in the tropics. These have conservation value if they provide habitat for threatened wildlife and maintain connectivity between larger habitats. Riverine forests have particular ‘corridor’ potential due to their linear shape, but are under-studied in many regions. We surveyed trees in riverine fragments in Bulindi, an anthropogenic landscape 25 km south of the Budongo Forest in western Uganda, to determine their condition and assess their value for wildlife, particularly endangered chimpanzees Pan troglodytes. We assessed tree composition, structure and diversity and compared results with a previous survey made in Budongo, the nearest main forest block. Riverine fragments were considerably less species-dense and species-rich than Budongo. Community composition differed markedly between sites and there was virtually no overlap in common species. Common trees in fragments were characteristic of East African swamp and groundwater forests (e.g. the palm Phoenix reclinata) and the dominant tree family was the Moraceae, members of which produce fleshy fruits attractive to frugivores (e.g. figs). Important fruit foods for chimpanzees differed between habitats. While basal area of important fruit trees was comparable, overall density was greater in fragments. Our data suggest the riverine fragments offer a relatively food-dense habitat for chimpanzees and other frugivores. Small riverine forests have little or no protection regionally and are being extensively logged and cleared for agriculture. Species logged for timber in Bulindi included important chimpanzee fruit trees. Unless conservation projects successfully reverse current trends, the value of the riverine corridors for maintaining connectivity between main forest blocks is limited.","Abstract Weekly Prostephanus truncatus (Horn) flight activity, measured as the density of captured beetles in pheromone baited traps, was monitored for 76 consecutive weeks at 16 sites inside the Lama forest in southern Benin and at four sites in maize farmland just outside the forest. Prostephanus truncatus flight activity was consistently higher and the flight activity pattern significantly different near maize stores than at sites inside the forest. Although P. truncatus is known to infest girdled branches of Lannea nigritana (Sc. Elliot) Keay, the P. truncatus flight activity was comparatively low at forest sites where this tree species dominated. The main peak in P. truncatus flight activity occurred earlier in the eastern part of the forest compared with other forest parts. Ordination analysis showed that comparatively higher flight activity in the eastern part of the forest was positively associated with the presence of teak plantations (Tectona grandis L. F.) at trap sites. The spatial distribution of weekly P. truncatus trap catches were found to be significantly aggregated during a 21-wk period, which largely coincided with the early increase in P. truncatus flight activity in the eastern part of the forest. Based on this evidence, it was suggested that P. truncatus individuals disperse from the eastern part of the forest to other forest parts and to nearby agricultural areas, rather than, as has been previously suggested, from maize stores to the forest environment.","Structural changes in secondary forests are less known in West Africa, and this precludes their management. This study aims at providing quantitative information on floristic composition and structure of the Lama secondary forests (Benin), so as to contribute to their restoration, and fill part of knowledge gaps on West African secondary forests. Data of 77 permanent plots each of 0.5 ha were used to analyze the floristic composition, the trajectory of the recovery and the recovery of stocking in these forests, compared to nearby old-growth forests. The results showed that the forests were less diversified with few species very common in the forest stands; the most dominant were Lonchocarpus sericeus and Anogeissus leiocarpa in the secondary forests, and Dialium guineense , Diospyros mespiliformis and Afzelia africana in the old-growth forests. The secondary forests hold more species than the mature ones. Their compositions will recover that of the original forest because species of the original forest were actively regenerating in the secondary forests. About 28 years after recovery, large trees were insufficient and basal area was about 60% of those of the mature forests. Further studies are needed to elucidate barriers to tree regeneration and dynamics of tree population. © 2016 International Formulae Group. All rights reserved.

The forest-dwelling butterfly Charaxes xiphares occidentalis is naturally confined to a small forest region in the south-western Cape, South Africa. Most of the remaining habitat of this species is within a fragmented agricultural matrix. Furthermore, this geographical area is also heavily invaded by alien plants, especially Acacia mearnsii . We investigated how C. x. occidentalis behaviourally responds to different habitat conditions in the landscape. We were particularly interested in touring, patrolling and settling behaviour as a conservation proxy for preference of a certain habitat configuration in this agricultural matrix. Remnant forest patches in the agricultural matrix showed fewer behavioural incidents than in a reference protected area. Moreover, dense stands of A. mearnsii negatively influenced the incidence and settling pattern of this butterfly across the landscape, with fewer tree settlings associated with more heavily invaded forest patches. This settling pattern was predominantly seen in female butterflies. We also identified specific trees that were settled upon for longer periods by C. x. occidentalis . Distance to a neighbouring patch and patch size influenced behavioural incidences, suggesting that further patch degradation and isolation could be detrimental to this butterfly. Conservation implications: We highlight the importance of clearing invasive tree species from vulnerable forest ecosystems and identify key tree species to consider in habitat conservation and rehabilitation programmes for this butterfly. We also suggest retaining as much intact natural forest as possible. This information should be integrated in local biodiversity management plans.","While most past studies have emphasized the relationships between specific forest stands and edaphic factors, recent observations in Central African moist forests suggested that an increase of slash-and-burn agriculture since 3000–2000 BP (Before Present) could be the main driver of the persistence of light-demanding tree species. In order to examine anthropogenic factors in the persistence of such populations, our study focused on Pericopsis elata, an endangered clustered timber species. We used a multidisciplinary approach comprised of botanical, anthracological and archaeobotanical investigations to compare P. elata patches with surrounding stands of mixed forest vegetation (“out-zones”). Charcoal samples were found in both zones, but were significantly more abundant in the soils of patches. Eleven groups of taxa were identified from the charcoals, most of them also present in the current vegetation. Potsherds were detected only inside P. elata patches and at different soil depths, suggesting a long human presence from at least 2150 to 195 BP, as revealed by our charcoal radiocarbon dating. We conclude that current P. elata patches most likely result from shifting cultivation that occurred ca. two centuries ago. The implications of our findings for the dynamics and management of light-demanding tree species are discussed.","Though agriculture has been linked to the decline in bird populations due to the associated changes in vegetation structure and composition, its potential to sustain birds has been explored over time. A sustainable agricultural landscape should be one that has the capacity to support bird species all year. To this end, we investigated the factors influencing pre‐ and post‐harvest farm conditions on bird abundance, richness, and feeding guilds in three different crop fields in Jos‐East and North, central Nigeria. We used line transects to survey birds and vegetation variables from 30 fields each of legumes, maize, and mixed (maize and soya bean) during the pre‐ and post‐harvest periods in central Nigeria. We modeled the effects of field conditions and vegetation parameters on bird species richness and encounter rates at overall and feeding‐guild levels. Our results showed that bird species richness was significantly higher pre‐harvest than post‐harvest. Bird encounter rate and feeding guild encounter rate were not affected by pre‐ and post‐harvest conditions. Bird species richness, encounter rate, and guild encounter rate were significantly higher in legume and mixed crop fields than in maize fields. In addition, in‐field tree density had a significant positive influence on bird and guild encounter rates, and species richness. Bird encounter rate and richness were significantly higher when the nearest non‐crop vegetation was either a gallery forest or rocky outcrop. A similar trend was observed for both insectivore and granivore encounter rates. Bird encounter rate declined with increasing distance from water sources and non‐crop vegetation. This study shows that pre‐ and post‐harvest conditions of crop fields can moderate the number and richness of birds on farmlands while the retention of trees on farmlands contributes to higher bird assemblages.","The East African coastal forests are subject of haphazard modification following anthropogenic pressures including tree cutting and clearing for agriculture. These activities, which are leading cause of habitat disturbance and species loss, are the major challenge in the management of sensitive wildlife species such as forest understory birds. This study investigated species composition of understory birds in the coastal forests of northeastern Tanzania to generate information for the management of the landscape and biodiversity in the area. Using mist nets, birds were trapped from core and edge habitats of representative forest patches. Trapped birds were classified to species level and categorized into bird guilds based on their levels of forest dependence. It was found out that species richness was influenced by forest patch size rather than level of habitat disturbance. Edge habitat was also found to be important in hosting higher number of forest understory birds, especially generalists—but this should be treated with caution because following habitat destruction that is ongoing in the study area, there is a danger of generalist wiping out specialist species due to competitive exclusion. Strict control measures to stop illegal tree cutting and agricultural activities near the forests were recommended for sustainable conservation of the understory birds in the forests.","“Secondary” forests are very different to “primary”, “noble” forests with their tall trees. Their exuberant, inextricable vegetation, with more lianas and small shrubs than trees, grows on formerly forested lands cleared for agriculture. In inhabited regions, they generally sur¬round villages and grow along roadsides, pushing the primary forest back to rocky hillsides and swamps. In Equatorial Af¬rica, “secondary” forests account today for 50 to 75% of all forested areas. These forests form in three stages: (i) seedlings appear of fast-growing sun-loving species (Musanga sp., Vernonia sp., Anthocleista sp.), which are not the same as primary forest species and which disperse their seeds over long distances; (ii) formation of an understorey, made up of the same shrub species as in “primary” forests but mixed in this case with a second group of banal sun-loving species characteristic of “secondary” forests, which quickly grow as high as the first group and sometimes higher; (iii) gradual reconstitution of “pri¬mary” forest with abundant Sapotaceae, Guttiferae and hard-wooded legu-minous species that are capable of regenerating in the undergrowth and through which some very tall trees eventually grow through the canopy. Okoume (Aucoumea klaineana), a valuable species typical of “secondary” forests, is common in the so-called “primary” forests of Gabon, which in fact are on formerly cleared forest land. Today, the high potential of these “sec¬ondary” forests must not be allowed to “go up in smoke”. Quite the reverse: we must learn to guide their development to hasten the establishment of commercially valuable species. Abstract adapted by the editorial team. (Resume d'auteur)","Tropical forests in the Americas are undergoing rapid conversion to commercial agriculture, and many migratory bird species that use these forests have experienced corresponding populations declines. Conservation research for migratory birds in the tropics has focused overwhelmingly on shade coffee plantations and adjacent forest, but both cover types are now in decline, creating an urgent need to evaluate conservation opportunities in other agricultural systems. Here we compare how a community of 42 Neotropical migratory bird species and a subset of five conservation-priority species differ in usage and habitat associations among a secondary forest baseline and four expanding commercial plantation systems in Guatemala: African oil palm, teak, rubber, and mixed-native hardwoods. We found that mixed-native hardwood plantations supported the highest richness and diversity of all migrants and that the three hardwood plantation types generally outperformed oil palm in richness and diversity metrics. Despite this, oil palm supported high abundance of several common and widespread species also experiencing range-wide population declines and may therefore play an important role in conserving common species. Mature secondary forest hosted low abundance and diversity of the full migratory community, but high abundance and richness of conservation priority migrants along with native hardwood and teak plantations. Likewise, the percentage of forest cover on the landscape was positively associated with priority migrant abundance and richness but negatively associated with the abundance of migrants in general, highlighting how individual species within the broad group of Neotropical migratory landbirds respond differently to anthropogenic changes in land use. Across all cover types, the retention of tall overstory trees increased the abundance, richness, and diversity of all migrants, which indicates that vertical structural diversity and remnant trees are important habitat features for birds in agricultural landscapes. Our findings show that conservation opportunities exist in hardwood and oil palm plantations, though the species likely to benefit from conservation action will vary among plantation types. For the subset of conservation priority migrants, our results suggest that conservation efforts should combine strategies that retain and restore secondary forest, promote the adoption of native hardwood and teak plantations, and promote the retention of tall, remnant trees in agricultural landscapes.",25.5188077095026,2,"tropic, protect, plant"

Employing a combination of machine learning and deep learning techniques, we developed a novel data fusion approach that integrated Digital Elevation Model (DEM) data, MODIS satellite imagery, WOSIS soil profile data, and CHELSA environmental data. This combined dataset, named GeoBlendMDWC, was specifically designed for SOC prediction. The primary aim of this research is to develop and evaluate a novel optimization algorithm for accurate SOC prediction by leveraging multi-source environmental data. Specifically, this study aims to (1) create an integrated dataset combining remote sensing and ground data for comprehensive SOC analysis, (2) develop a new optimization technique that enhances both machine learning and deep learning model performance, and (3) evaluate the algorithm’s efficiency and accuracy against established optimization methods like Jaya and GridSearchCV. This study focused on India, Australia, and South Africa, countries known for their significant agricultural activities. We introduced a novel optimization technique for both machine learning and deep neural networks, comparing its performance to established methods like the Jaya optimization technique and GridSearchCV. The models evaluated included XGBoost Regression, LightGBM, Gradient Boosting Regression (GBR), Random Forest Regression, Decision Tree Regression, and a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) model. Our research demonstrated that the proposed optimization algorithm consistently outperformed existing methods in terms of execution time and performance. It achieved results comparable to GridSearchCV, reaching an R2 of 90.16, which was a significant improvement over the base XGBoost model’s R2 of 79.08. In deep learning optimization, it significantly outperformed the Jaya algorithm, achieving an R2 of 61.34 compared to Jaya’s 30.04. Moreover, it was 20–30 times faster than GridSearchCV. Given its speed and accuracy, this algorithm can be applied to real-time data processing in remote sensing satellites. This advanced methodology will greatly benefit the agriculture and farming sectors by providing precise SOC predictions.","Crop area extent estimates and crop type maps provide crucial information for agricultural monitoring and management. Remote sensing imagery in general and, more specifically, high temporal and high spatial resolution data as the ones which will be available with upcoming systems, such as Sentinel-2, constitute a major asset for this kind of application. The goal of this paper is to assess to what extent state-of-the-art supervised classification methods can be applied to high resolution multi-temporal optical imagery to produce accurate crop type maps at the global scale. Five concurrent strategies for automatic crop type map production have been selected and benchmarked using SPOT4 (Take5) and Landsat 8 data over 12 test sites spread all over the globe (four in Europe, four in Africa, two in America and two in Asia). This variety of tests sites allows one to draw conclusions applicable to a wide variety of landscapes and crop systems. The results show that a random forest classifier operating on linearly temporally gap-filled images can achieve overall accuracies above 80% for most sites. Only two sites showed low performances: Madagascar due to the presence of fields smaller than the pixel size and Burkina Faso due to a mix of trees and crops in the fields. The approach is based on supervised machine learning techniques, which need in situ data collection for the training step, but the map production is fully automatic.","Effective drought management requires precise measurement, but this is challenging due to the variety of drought indices and indicators, each with unique methods and specific uses, and limited ground data availability. This study utilizes remote sensing data from 2001 to 2020 to compute drought indices categorized as meteorological, agricultural, and hydrological. A Gaussian kernel convolves these indices into a denoised, multi-band composite image. Further refinement with a Gaussian kernel enhances a single drought index from each category: Reconnaissance Drought Index (RDI), Soil Moisture Agricultural Drought Index (SMADI), and Streamflow Drought Index (SDI). The enhanced index, encompassing all bands, serves as a predictor for classification and regression tree (CART), support vector machine (SVM), and random forest (RF) machine learning models, further improving the three indices. CART demonstrated the highest accuracy and error minimization across all drought categories, with root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) values between 0 and 0.4. RF ranked second, while SVM, though less reliable, achieved values below 0.7. The results show persistent drought in the Sahel, North Africa, and southwestern Africa, with meteorological drought affecting 30% of Africa, agricultural drought affecting 22%, and hydrological drought affecting 21%.","The efficacy of the Senegal prickly-ash Zanthoxylum zanthoxyloides (Lam.) roots and the African locust bean tree Parkia biglobosa (Jacq.) pod back was study for their efficacy in the control of okra pest, Podagrica spp. The study was carried out in the laboratory and on the field in the farming season of 2018. Z. zanthoxyloides roots were obtained from Jima-Doko forest and P. biglibosa fruit back from Takunpara. Both plant materials were air-dried under shade for 120 hours. Both plant parts were pounded separately in wooden mortar with the aid of wooden pestle until the materials turns to fine particles. Determined weight of 100, 150, 200, 250, and 300 grams were taken for each plant materials and soaked in water for 24 hours and stirred at intervals of an hour. The mixture were then sieved with a muslin cloth and filtered with Whatman filter paper to eliminate all finest particles of varying sizes. These concentrations were applied individually on 10 adults of Podagrica spp. in the laboratory. It was observed that the concentration of 200 – 300g performed better for both plant materials in the control of okra flea beetle. These resulted to the death of above 50% of the insect within 2 hours. These significant laboratory trials were then formulated and taken to the field. Both plant materials acted as anti-feedants and repellants against Podagrica spp. It was also revealed that Z. zanthoxyloides performed significantly (p<0.05) better than the P. biglibosa. Furthermore, short interval applications (<or=3days) of these plant materials could be a good  replacement for synthetic chemicals, hence bio-pesticides that could be adopted for organic agriculture.","Fruit-tree crops generate food and income for local households and contribute to South Africa’s gross domestic product. Timely and accurate phenotyping of fruit-tree crops is essential for innovating and achieving precision agriculture in the horticulture industry. Traditional methods for fruit-tree crop classification are time-consuming, costly, and often impossible to use for mapping heterogeneous horticulture systems. The application of remote sensing in smallholder agricultural landscapes is more promising. However, intercropping systems coupled with the presence of dispersed small agricultural fields that are characterized by common and uncommon crop types result in imbalanced samples, which may limit conventionally applied classification methods for phenotyping. This study assessed the influence of balanced and imbalanced multi-class distribution and data-sampling techniques on fruit-tree crop detection accuracy. Seven data samples were used as input to adaptive boosting (AdaBoost), gradient boosting (GB), random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and eXtreme gradient boost (XGBoost) machine learning algorithms. A pixel-based approach was applied using Sentinel-2 (S2). The SVM algorithm produced the highest classification accuracy of 71%, compared with AdaBoost (67%), RF (65%), XGBoost (63%), and GB (62%), respectively. Individually, the majority of the crop types were classified with an F1 score of between 60% and 100%. In addition, the study assessed the effect of size and ratio of class imbalance in the training datasets on algorithms’ sensitiveness and stability. The results show that the highest classification accuracy of 71% could be achieved from an imbalanced training dataset containing only 60% of the original dataset. The results also showed that S2 data could be successfully used to map fruit-tree crops and provide valuable information for subtropical crop management and precision agriculture in heterogeneous horticultural landscapes.","Soil moisture (SM) is a fundamental constituent of the terrestrial environment and the hydrological cycle. Owing to its significant influence on catchment hydrological responses, it can be utilized as an indicator of floods and droughts to aid early warning systems. This study aimed to develop a field‐scale method to estimate SM using parametric and machine learning‐based methods to compare whether advanced artificial intelligence methods can give similar results as traditional methods. Considering this, monthly observed SM data (from the top 10 cm), environmental covariates, and remotely sensed data from March 2019 to July 2021 for the Cathedral Peak Research Catchments VI and IX in South Africa were obtained. From the 241 observations obtained across 12 sites, 160 (∼66%) were used for model training, while the remaining 81 (∼34%) were used for model testing. Employing 10‐fold cross‐validation, the individual machine learning models (viz., support vector machine [SVM], random forest (RF), k‐nearest neighbor, classification and regression trees [Rpart], and generalized linear model) displayed a satisfactory performance (R2 = 0.52–0.79; root mean square error = 3.79–5.80). In the validation phase, the RF model displayed a superior performance, followed by the SVM. Subsequent SM estimation using the hybrid model produced satisfactory results in training (R2 = 0.90) and testing (R2 = 0.45). The results obtained from this study can aid in predicting SM variations in catchments with limited monitoring. Furthermore, this model can be applied in drought monitoring, forecasting, and informing agricultural management practices.","Unfettered agricultural activities have severely degraded vast areas of grasslands over the last decade. To rehabilitate and restore the productivity in affected grasslands, rangeland management practices still institute vast nitrogen-based fertilization regimes. However, excessive fertilization can often have damaging environmental effects. Over-fertilization can lead to nitrogen saturation. Although early indicators of nitrogen saturation have been documented, research detailing the near-real-time nitrogen saturation status of grasslands is required to better facilitate management protocols and optimize biomass production within degraded grasslands. Hence, the aim of this study was to discriminate nitrogen-saturated tropical grasses grown under a diverse fertilization treatment trial, using Worldview-3 satellite imagery and decision tree techniques. To accomplish this, nitrogen-saturated plots were first identified through specific physiological-based criteria. Thereafter, Worldview-3 satellite imagery (400–1040 nm) and decision tree techniques were applied to discriminate between nitrogen-saturated and -unsaturated grassland plots. The results showed net nitrate (NO3−-N) concentrations and net pH levels to be significantly different (α = 0.05) between saturated and non-saturated plots. Moreover, the random forest model (overall accuracy of 91%) demonstrated a greater ability to classify saturated plots as opposed to the classification and regression tree method (overall accuracy of 79%). The most important variables for classifying saturated plots were identified as: the Red-Edge (705–745 nm), Coastal (400–450 nm), Near-Infrared 3 (838–950 nm), Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI) and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index 3 (NDVI3). These results provide a framework to assist rangeland managers in identifying grasslands within the initial stages of nitrogen saturation. This will enable fertilization treatments to be adjusted in near-real-time according to ecosystem demand and thereby maintain the health and longevity of Southern African grasslands.","Peat swamp forests are the second rarest forest type found in South Africa while dune forests have been un- der severe threat through mining and agriculture. Both forest types exist in the conservation area, and World Heritage site, known as the iSimangaliso Wetland Park on the East coast of South Africa. The area is prone to severe droughts (Taylor et al., 2006) and recent attempts to understand the local wa- ter balance revealed that there was insufficient information on the water use of the indigenous forests of the area. The peat swamp forest and dune forest sites studied in this re- search were located within close proximity to each other, yet, are characterised by different landscape positions in terms of water availability. The coastal dune forest soil profile was generally dry and sandy and the tree roots did not have ac- cess to the water table. In contrast the peat swamp forest is located in an interdunal wetland where the trees have perma- nent access to water. The climate at both sites is subtropical with a mean annual precipitation of 1200 mm yr 1 . However, over 20 months of measurement, the first summer (October 2009 to March 2010) was drier (424 versus 735 mm) than the second summer (October 2010 to March 2011) emphasising the variability of the rainfall in the area and providing a wide range of conditions measured. The sap flow of an evergreen, overstory Syzygium cor- datum and a semi-deciduous, understory Shirakiopsis ellip- tica were measured in the peat swamp forest using the heat ratio method. The Syzygium cordatum water use was not highly seasonal and the daily maximum water use ranged from approximately 30 L d 1 in winter to 45 L d 1 in sum- mer whereas the Shirakiopsis elliptica water use was more seasonal at 2 L d 1 in winter and 12 L d 1 in summer. The water use of the Syzygium cordatum was not influenced by seasonal rainfall variations and was actually higher in the drier summer (October 2009 to March 2010). Three trees of different heights were monitored in the same way in the dune forest and the water use found to be highly seasonal. Over the entire measurement period, the water use was highest for an emergent Mimusops caffra (5 to 45 L d 1 ), whereas the wa- ter use of the Eugenia natalitia (2 to 28 L d 1 ) and Drypetes natalensis (1 to 4 L d 1 ) was lower. At the dune forest, the water use was highest in the wetter summer due to the re- liance of the trees on rainfall to recharge the soil water. A split-line regression showed that on average, soil water lim- ited tree water use 64 % of the time over the measurement period at the dune forest. For modelling tree water use at the dune forest, it was concluded that a two-stage model, tak- ing soil water content into account (from multiple sampling points), would be necessary.","Agricultural field trees constitute social nets for rural households in Burkina Faso. However, in recent decades they have been affected by climate variability, which has led to a significant reduction in the populations of dominant species such as shea and African locust within them. The objective of this study is therefore to determine the adaptation strategies developed by managers, as well as the factors influencing these strategies to cope with the changing environment. The methodology deployed for this purpose consists of primary and secondary data collection. Descriptive statistics and binary logistic regression were used to analyse the collected data. The study revealed that more than 70% of the tree managers are men and the majority of them are illiterate, with households of 5-15 children. In addition, more than 80% of the managers have agriculture as their main activity, and the size of their holdings is between 1ha and 10ha. Three strategies are used by tree managers in agricultural fields. The proactive strategy aims to anticipate the consequences of climate variability. The reactive strategy aims to react to the effects of climate variability. The strategy of silvicultural techniques consists of pruning, grafting and assisting the trees. However, the choice of strategies is influenced by the socio-economic characteristics of the respondents. For example, the proactive strategy is influenced by education level, household size and income from non-timber forest products. For the reactive strategy, the size of the holding and the level of education have an effect on the choice of strategy. For the silvicultural techniques strategy, age and education level have an impact on the choice of strategy. It is then up to the relevant authorities to work in the light of these results to initiate actions to strengthen the coping strategies of the people managing the trees in the agricultural fields.","Rain-fed farming is the primary livelihood of semi-arid West Africa. Changes in land cover have the potential to affect precipitation, the critical resource for production. Turbulent flux measurements from two eddy-covariance towers and additional observations from a dense network of small, wireless meteorological stations combine to relate land cover (savanna forest and agriculture) to evaporation in a small (3.5 km 2 ) catchment in Burkina Faso, West Africa. We observe larger sensible and latent heat fluxes over the savanna-forest in the headwater area relative to the agricultural section of the watershed. Fluxes above the savanna-forest are higher because of the greater number of exposed rocks and trees and the higher productivity of the forest compared to rainfed, hand-farmed agricultural fields. We deduce that there is a higher soil heat flux in the fields. Vegetation cover and soil moisture are found to be the primary controls of the evaporative fraction, defined as the latent heat over the available energy. Satellite derived vegetation index (NDVI) and soil moisture are determined to be good predictors of evaporative fraction. Our measurements provide an estimator that can be used to estimate evaporative fraction when only NDVI is available. Such large-scale estimates of evaporative fraction from remotely sensed data are valuable where ground-based measurements are lacking, which is the case across the African continent and many other semi-arid areas. Evaporative fraction estimates can be combined, for example, with sensible heat from measurements of temperature variance, to provide an estimate of evaporation when only minimal meteorological measurements are available in remote regions of the world. These findings reinforce local cultural beliefs of the importance of forest fragments for climate regulation and may provide support to local decision makers and rural farmers in the maintenance of the forest areas.",20.5798230346461,0,"water, veget, result"

A total of 155 genotypes randomly chosen from the four subsets were analyzed for random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) variation. Nine decamer primers generated a total of 43 fragments, 42 of which were polymorphic across the 155 genotypes. Pairwise distances were calculated between germplasm subsets using the distance metric algorithm in S-PLUS, and used to examine intra-and inter-subset variance components by analysis of molecular variation (AMOVAR). A phenogram based on unweighted pair group method with arithmetic average (UPGMA) cluster analysis was constructed from the pairwise distances and a scatter plot was generated from principal coordinate analysis. The AMOVAR showed that most of the variation in the germplasm (94.6%) was found within subsets, suggesting that there is significant variation among the germplasm. The grouping of genotypes based on the phenogram and scatter plot generally did not reflect the pedigree or provenance of the genotypes. It is possible that more RAPD markers are needed for determining genetic relationships in apple germplasm. Nevertheless, the variation observed in the study suggests that the current practice of sublining populations in the first generation to control inbreeding may not be necessary in subsequent generations. If these results are confirmed by fully informative molecular markers, germplasm managers should reassess the structure of their genetics populations. There may be a need to combine sublines in order to capture the maximum genetic diversity available and to streamline breeding efforts. genetic resources in germplasm collections and successive stages of development in breeding programs. More specifically, knowledge of genetic diversity and relationships among sets of germplasm and the potential merit of the genetic diversity is critical to plant improvement (Lee, 1995). In 1990, the Horticulture and Food Research Institute of New Zealand Limited (HortResearch), established a population improvement program to broaden the genetic base and, at the same time study the genetics of horticulturally important traits in apples. An apple genetics population was developed from imported seed and pollen from apple cultivars and varieties from clonal repositories in major apple producing regions in Europe, North America, Australia, Asia and South Africa (Noiton and Shelbourne, 1992). Seeds of accessions of Malus sieversii (Lebed.) were also obtained from Kazakhstan—the presumed center of origin of the cultivated apples (Hokanson et al., 1997). These seedlings have been planted in research orchards in a recurrent selection breeding strategy and maintained at multiple sites to allow for evaluation of general and regionally important horticultural traits and biotic and abiotic resistances. We as germplasm managers now need to assess the level of diversity within this collection to help make informed decisions on management procedures as well as on the choice of breeding strategies to use in combining horticulturally important traits in our breeding program. Historically, assessments of genetic composition of germplasm collections have been carried out at several levels including inferences based on reproductive biology, ecogeographic data, morphology, pigmentation, ontogeny, social history, pedigree records, breeding behavior, in situ and ex situ evaluation of traits, chromosome structure and behavior, protein markers, and molecular markers such as restricted fragment length polymorReceived for publication 10 July 2000.

The consequences of loss of genetic diversity have been experienced sporadically throughout history, often with significant human and economic costs, which has been a common problem with many of the world’s important food crops (Way et al., 1990). The genus Malus (apples), is characterized by large diversity, but thus far this has not been translated in the cultivated (Malus sylvestris (L) Mill. var. domestica (Borkh.) Mansf.) varieties (Way et al., 1990). Modern commercial apple orchards are dominated by only a few cultivars and many breeding programs utilize only a few well known cultivars in crosses for commercial apple production (Noiton and Shelbourne, 1992; Way et al., 1990). As a result, levels of inbreeding and coancestry in modern apples have been projected to increase (Noiton and Alspach, 1996). Awareness of genetic diversity and management of crop genetic resources have been important components of plant improvement programs. The foundation of crop-based agriculture rests largely on the availability and knowledge of extant plant phisms (RLFPs). The emergence of new polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based molecular markers, such as randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) markers, simple sequence repeats (SSRs), and amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs), has created opportunities to characterize germplasm collections at the molecular level, with markers that are presumably selectively neutral and not affected in their expression by environmental effects. The increased levels of variation detectable with these molecular markers have allowed germplasm managers, plant breeders, and geneticists to pursue with new vigor important questions relating to crops and their genetic resources (Bretting and Widrlechner, 1995). RAPD analyses have various scientific, operational, and budgetary advantages for genome mapping (Welsh and McClelland, 1990, 1991; Williams et al., 1990) and are used with a high degree of success as tools for harnessing genes from germplasm resources in our own apple genome mapping program (Gardiner et al., 1996a, 1999). These same advantages also appear valid for characterization of genetic variation for effective germplasm conservation and use, hence research in population genetics has shown the most growth with respect to the use of RAPD technology (Hedrick, 1992). RAPD markers have been used to create DNA fingerprints for the study of individual identity and taxonomic relationships in both eucaryotic and procaryotic organisms (Caetano-Anolles et al., 1991; Hu and Quiros, 1991; Kresovich et al., 1992); in apples, to differentiate cultivars (Koller et al., 1993), for paternity analysis (Harada et al., 1993), for determining genetic relationships in Malus sylvestris var. domestica cultivars and wild species (Dunemann et al., 1994), along with RFLPs and isozymes for tracing the parentage of ‘Braeburn’ (Gardiner et al., 1996b), and for phylogenetic studies (Zhou and Li, 2000). The following research was conducted to examine the distribution of genetic diversity in the HortResearch apple germplasm collection using RAPD markers. The objectives of the investigation were to 1) assess the level of diversity between and within different subsets of apple germplasm, 2) determine the similarity of the selections/cultivars within the collections and 3) determine if the gene pool of apples had been effectively enlarged with the germplasm obtained from other countries and continents. Materials and Methods PLANT MATERIAL. The HortResearch apple germplasm was divided into four subsets. Subset 1 consisted of old cultivars and breeding lines that are maintained in the repository and the National Cultivar Center (NCC), and subsets 2, 3 and 4 consisted sublines in the apple genetics population. The apple genetics population comprised open-pollinated (op) families as well as families derived from controlled crosses from primitive cultivars, cider apples, and wild species (Noiton et al., 1999), including wild accessions of Malus sieversii (Lebed.) and M. kirghisorum (Al.) Ponom. from Kazakhstan. The families were divided into four sublines and planted at the third leaf stage in randomized incomplete blocks of 20 single tree plots at three different sites over a period of 4 years as follows: 1991: 224 families (10,232 trees); 1992: 149 families (12,800 trees); 72 families (4,862 trees); and 1994: 86 families (3,665 trees). Sublining was used to control inbreeding and maximize, as far as possible, genetic variability and heterozygosity within the population (Noiton and Shelbourne, 1992). We crossed within sublines per generation since inbreeding is unlikely to be a serious problem for many generations. Nevertheless, we had planned to introduce new unrelated material after a few generations to circumvent inbreeding. Ideally, the families should have been grouped into sublines based on region of origin so that individuals from the same region will be confined to one subline. For example, families from countries in Western Europe should be in a different subline than families from countries in North America or Eastern Europe. But this never really happened in our own case, due in part to the fact that seeds were","Papaver Centre was constituted in 2013 at the University of South Bohemia in České Budějovice, Czech Republic. The name of centre represents common and interesting genus of plants which is distributed from Northern Africa across Europe to the polar latitudes. The aim of the Papaver Centre is to develop ties within the interdisciplinary team consisting of paleoecologists, archaeologists, and vegetation ecologists in order to create an effective space for the study of climatic, cultural as well as landscape changes. This paper describes recent educational and scientific activities of the centre. One of main results is realization series of international lectures of top scientists, which substantially improved capabilities of members in the Laboratory of Archaeobotany and Palaeoecology.

Centre for Human and Plant Studies of Postglacial Europe and Northern Africa, 2013–2015 114 the project has been to stabilize and extend the operational range of the research group, which connects archaeological directions in landscape development research with the latest trends in botany. The research centre bears the name of the genus of poppies (Papaver), the representatives of which are distributed from the coldest areas on Svalbard to the warmest of northern Africa, and thus represents the region targeted by the project’s research interests. 2. Papaver Centre and research development in 2013–2015 In accord with the project’s idea to create conditions for top science, the members of the Papaver team actively contributed to the scientific goals of their different projects. The synergy between several active research grants and the Papaver project was extraordinarily useful. The support has enabled interdisciplinary space to be created for several specific palaeoecological, archaeobotanical and botanical research tasks. The Papaver project has been led by the head of the centre, archaeologist and archaeobotanist Jaromír Beneš, and the scientific supervisor for the whole team, botanist and vegetation ecologist Karel Prach. The Papaver team itself has been organized into three thematic panels. The paleoecological group, led by J. Novák, has integrated and organized activities connected with a multi-proxy approach focused on the reconstruction of the Holocene vegetation changes in terms of vegetation, climate, and human impact upon environmental changes throughout Europe (Bešta et al. 2015). Up to now the scholars involved in the Papaver project have contributed into many multi-proxy palaeoecological and archaeobotanical studies in central Europe (Hlásek et al. 2014; Hlásek et al. 2015; Chvojka et al. 2014; Pokorná et al. 2014). The attention of the project has also been focused on the anthracological research at many important archaeological sites (Novák 2014a; Novák 2014b). Anthracology is an effective method for the study of macrovegetation in the landscape (trees and shrubs). Other anthracological studies highlight the importance of pedoanthracological research for the reconstruction of woodland history; for example, in the sandstone area of North Bohemia (Prostředník et al. 2014). The environmental archaeology group has been led by J. Beneš. This panel has focused on research into the Mesolithic/Neolithic transition in central Europe; however, the younger post Neolithic periods of human impact on nature in prehistoric Bohemia and Moravia have not been omitted. The aim of the Papaver team has also been to investigate Mesolithic hunter-gatherers through a broad interdisciplinary approach. The members have participated in a range of archaeological excavations, occuring in certain regions of the Czech Republic, namely the Třeboň basin in south Bohemia, and the north Bohemian pseudokarst area of Bohemian Paradise (Šída et al. 2014; Divišová, Šída 2015). Apart from the excavations themselves and artefact analyses, a number of palaeoecological and archaeobotanical analyses have formed integral components of the research. A variety of questions regarding former human behaviour, environment, plant use, human impact on the landscape, etc., are being investigated using the tools of environmental archaeology, such as pollen analysis or analysis of plant macroremains. In addition, the issue of the last hunter-gatherers in the region and their transition to farming, which is of special importance, has been addressed by examining specific sites together with artefactual and ecofactual material recovered from sediments dated from the Mesolithic onwards. A second connection between environmental archaeology and archaeobotany has been created in the case of the Bronze Age period and Early Iron Age period in south Bohemia. The aim of our research has been the notification of current macro-remains analysis of the prehistory cultural sediments in the region of South Bohemia. The analysed assemblage consists of a cluster of sites dated in a time span from the Late Neolithic to the Early Iron Age period. The samples have been obtained during the course of salvage, as well as scholarly, excavations between the years 2005 and 2015 (Šálková et al. 2014). In our research, macroremains analysis represents another source of interpretation of archaeological features, infills, and cultural layers, and makes possible the reconstruction of the palaeoeconomy of settlement areas (e.g. housing, economy, structure of utility plants and weeds, burial rites), as well as the natural environment in the background of human sites (e.g. Šálková et al. 2015; Hlásek et al. 2014; Chvojka et al. 2014; Hlásek et al. 2015; Fröhlich et al. 2014). The third direction of research in the environmental archaeology panel has been the study of the relationship of plants and humans in the medieval period and Early Modern Age in historical Czech lands. The archaeobotanical attractiveness of such research in these relatively young periods is that it increases a direct and unmistakable link to the present we live in now. This is especially obvious in the comparative research into the development and changes in individual types of cereals used during the malting process and subsequent brewing between the 13th and 18th centuries. As a result, we have managed to penetrate specific production processes, and the qualitative and quantitative aspects of brewing and malting before the advent of modern technology (Kočár et al. 2015). Medieval and Early Modern agriculture as a cardinal factor in the transformation of landscape and humaninduced changes in vegetation has been under the focus of Papaver Centre members. In the case of terraced fields in Malonín (South Bohemia), we have established a new methodology in how to date such changes (Houfková et al. 2015). Thanks to another research grant, we have performed archaeological excavations of the long-stripped fields in the abandoned village Malonín. Our approach has consisted of a combination of information from different sources such as historical documents and maps, chronologies based on the dating of archaeological artefacts, 14C data, and the assignment of 210Pb, 137Cs concentrations. Our results have proved that the current pattern of field margins in the former village of Malonín is High Medieval in origin.

Centre for Human and Plant Studies of Postglacial Europe and Northern Africa, 2013–2015 115 recent landscape patterns in many villages in marginal areas of central Europe can be based on man-made structures originating in the Medieval Period, we conclude that the memory of the medieval landscape remains very strong. Our results have provided arguments for the preservation of such defined landscape units; this could lead to a conservation of both long-term historical pattern and recent biodiversity bound to its exact combination of landscape elements. The issue of the Medieval and the Early Modern economy and ecology in historical towns has also been very attractive. Members of the Papaver Centre have studied two sites: Písek-Bakaláře (the Medieval secondarily filled-in well; Šálková et al. 2015) and České Budějovice, Krajinská street 7 (the Medieval cesspit; Čapek et al. 2015). In those times wells were very often secondarily used as cesspits: because of water contamination or changes in water regimes. Various aspects of human life and behaviour have been reflected in the waste disposal and storage inside “Well 1” in PísekBakaláře. It has been possible to detect imported material of different origins and to reconstruct the environment of the town’s background (meadows, fields, gardens, forests), as well as animal rearing (cattle, sheep, pig, horse, dog, cat), crops grown (cereals and fruits), and waste management practices (Šálková et al. 2015). The faecal infill of the cesspit in České Budějovice, Krajinská 7 was characterised by the macroremains of utility plants which reflected the food strategy of medieval burghers (Čapek et al. 2015). Since the Early Modern world was not only about production but also about consumption, a pilot study on the everyday life of selected “consumers” in the south Bohemian town of Czech Krumlov (UNESCO) has been created with an emphasis on the reconstruction of the eating habits of townspeople during the 17th century (Preusz et al. 2014), using the testimony of archival sources, archaeology, archaeobotany and archaeozoology. Our investigation has revealed that changes in the traditional stereotypical diet and social customs have crystallized over the centuries, and has opened","Climate change will challenge the resilience of both agriculture-based livelihoods and natural resource management regimes in East Africa in myriad ways. A major challenge is to reduce the vulnerability of people and climate-sensitive sectors, including water, agriculture, and energy, to today?s climate variability and to ensure that future development activities are appropriate to future climate contexts. Through an Ecosystem-based Adaptation (EbA) research approach this project will help to inform rural stakeholders and national policy makers in East Africa regarding the sustainability of different local and national adaptation strategies. The research approaches will integrate a review of the climate change adaptation policy contexts with local level analyses of stakeholder vulnerability, and roles of forest and tree-based ecosystem services in promoting resilience of agriculture production. Based on these research outputs a participatory approach will be used to develop effective adaptation strategies targeted at different local and national stakeholder groups. This research project will target select communities on the Kenyan and Ugandan slopes of Mt. Elgon, known as one of the five water towers of Kenya. This project will be led by the Center for International Forestry Research (CIFOR). The research team conducting this project comprises two international centers of scientific excellence focussed specifically on forestry and agroforestry-science (CIFOR and the World Agroforestry Center), with one institution in Uganda (Makerere University) and one in Kenya (KEFRI) and that have led the development of long-term studies on forest based governance and livelihoods in their respective countries. Together, this group of institutions assembles leading scientists in their respective fields, providing this project with expertise in climate and ecosystem modelling, analysis of vulnerability and governance institutions, understandings of national and sub-national policy debates around climate change adaptation, and both the knowledge of research contexts and stakeholder rapport at sub-/national levels needed to ensure successful research and policy maker engagement. This project represents a continuation of the Rockefeller Foundation?s commitment to facilitating the development of East African excellence in research around climate change issues. This collaboration between CIFOR and the World Agroforestry Center is also consistent with the new realignment of Consultative Group for International Agricultural Research (CGIAR) research efforts, specifically through the development of the CGIAR Research Program 6 (CRP6) entitled: Forests, Trees and Agroforestry: Livelihoods, Landscapes and Governance.","A relação entre água, energia e alimento é um tema que tem recebido atenção no meio acadêmico. Diante da escassez dos recursos naturais, da degradação que tem ocorrido não somente no Brasil, mas no mundo todo, os recursos naturais têm sérios riscos de esgotarem. E há que se pensar em uma gestão que possibilite a recuperação do meio ambiente de forma eficiente e sustentável. Compreendendo que o debate de nexo envolve um conjunto de inter-relações entre os recursos naturais utilizados como insumo para os serviços básicos da vida humana, neste sentido, a presente pesquisa objetivou analisar se há possibilidade de integrar a floresta ao nexo água-energia-alimentos, com vistas a não comprometer as demandas futuras e como isso pode contribuir para alcançar os Objetivos de Desenvolvimento Sustentável (ODS). Os objetivos específicos são identificar a interligação entre água, energia, alimento e floresta; apontar a necessidade de integrar a floresta ao nexo tradicional visando alcançar um desenvolvimento mais sustentável e controlar, prevenir as consequências dos impactos ambientais. A metodologia da revisão literária ocorreu com o levantamento por termos previamente identificados nas bases de dados Scopus, Web of Science e Periódico Capes, sendo a pesquisa classificada com abordagem qualitativa e método dedutivo. Os resultados apontaram que a floresta possui relação direta com os elementos água-energia-alimentos, sendo possível contribuir com as seguranças hídrica, energética e alimentar. Concluiu-se que vincular as florestas ao nexo existente, proporcionará uma maior preocupação para garantir a sustentabilidade e o equilíbrio ambiental.   Referências ALROY, John.

The results indicate that the availability of water, fuel-wood and fodder decreased, agricultural production declined and livelihood opportunities were reduced mainly due to depletion of natural resources. Consequently, the male out-migration increased by 15% during 1981–2011. This increased workload of women by 25%, more than 40% women are under severe threat of a variety of health risks generated mainly due to excess work-load, under-nourishment and lack of hygiene and sanitation.

Joshi members of the family (Maithani 1996). On the other hand, there is severe shortage of adult male labour to work in agriculture and other sectors of rural economy which further acts as a drag on agricultural productivity and retards the process of socio-economic development in the mountains. The cumulative impact of all these physical, socio-economic and cultural constraints in the mountains is leading to grinding poverty, hardship, constant fear of insecurity, a feeling of helplessness, and complete dependence on the outside help. The environment thus created is not conducive to attaining the goals of sustainable mountain development (Maithani 1996; Joshi and Tiwari 2013). During the recent past a variety of changes has emerged in traditional resource utilization pattern mainly in response to the population growth and resultant increased demand of natural resources, and to the global change, particularly economic globalisation, urbanization and climate change in the Himalayas (IOM 2008; Jain and Nagarwalla 2004; Tiwari and Joshi 2012a). Women experience these changes differently and disproportionately and respond to them in a varying manner because of socially constructed gender relations and environmental sensitivity of mountain ecosystems. They make use of their critical traditional knowledge of and experience with natural resource management and adapting agricultural and food systems to multiple drivers of environmental change, including climate change, globalisation and economic processes, out-migration, and land-use changes in mountain environments, which helped women to become an important agent of sustainable mountain development (ICIMOD 2011). However, these changes have exerted sharply accentuated pressures on local economy through depletion of land, water, biodiversity and forests resources, collapsing conventional production system and increasing community vulnerability to livelihood and food insecurity and increased risks of natural disasters (World Bank 2009; Lonergan 1998). This has augmented male out-migration, and consequently increased hardships of rural women and deteriorated their quality of life (Mamgain 2003; Tiwari and Joshi 2012b). Conceptual Background Mountains have long been marginalized from the view point of sustainable development of their resources and inhabitants. However, during the recent years our understanding about the problems of mountain regions and approach to their development has undergone drastic changes (ICIMOD 2010). This is reflected by a deepening anxiety over the depletion of natural resources and disruption of mountain ecosystem services. As a result, the significance of mountain social-ecological systems was acknowledged for the first time on a global scale in Agenda 21 of the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED), held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in 1992 (UN 2012). Mountains include some of the most fragile ecosystems on the planet (ICIMOD 2010) as they are highly sensitive to changes caused by natural as well as anthropogenic factors (Sonesson and Messerli 2002). The drivers of changes range from a variety on natural hazards and disasters to a series of human-induced processes such as population growth, depletion of natural resources, urbanization, economic globalisation and resultant intensification of land use (Tiwari 2000; ICIMOD 2011). Moreover, changing climatic conditions have put pressure on the mountain environments through higher mean annual temperatures and melting of glaciers and snow, altered precipitation patterns, and more frequent and extreme weather events 79 Environmental Changes, Rural Out-migration and Social Dynamics in Himalayas which are likely to intensify the impacts of other natural as well as socio-economic drivers of change (IPCC 2007; UNEP-WCMC 2002; CIDA 2002; Brody et al. 2008; Daley 2011). Subsistence agriculture, livestock raising and income generation through small scale trade, and wage and casual labour constitute the main source of livelihood of mountain communities (Leduc and Shrestha 2008). The Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) of the United Nations has identified more than 75% of the land surface of the world’s mountain as unsuitable or marginally suitable for agriculture (Huddleston and Ataman 2003; Messerli and Ives 1997; IFAD 2001). It has been observed that the proportion of poor and vulnerable people increases with elevation (Huddleston and Ataman 2003). There are indications that poverty inequality between mountain people and those living in other areas is currently increasing (ICIMOD 2010). Approximately, 271 million people, which accounts for nearly 40% of the mountain population in developing and transition countries, have been estimated to be highly vulnerable to food insecurity, specifically in Asia and Latin America (Huddleston and Ataman 2003; FAO 2008). High dependency on natural resources and increasing marginalisation are some of important factors for prevailing poverty, food and livelihood insecurity and poor community health, in mountains of developing countries which are further increasing their vulnerability to long-term impacts of global environmental changes (Huddleston and Ataman 2003). The globalizing economy has both positive as well as negative impacts on the mountain livelihoods and economy. The fast growing tourism industry in India, China and Nepal has opened new opportunities for the growth of mountain economy. Furthermore, China and India are the fastest growing economies in Asia, yet, they have the highest poverty ratios. Moreover, the economic globalisation have further increased the vulnerability of the mountain communities to the environmental risks through exploitation of natural resources even in remote and inaccessible areas, particularly in the developing countries. This seems to have further deepened poverty imbalances between highlands and lowlands (Hassan et al. 2005; Huddleston and Ataman 2003). However, for millennia the mountain communities were developing distinctive mechanisms to adapt to these typical conditions through evolving a range of adaptive measures (UNEP 2004; ICIMOD 2010). Migration of male youth is one the important adaptive measures to constraints of subsistence economy and changing environmental conditions and associated natural and socio-economic risks across all the mountain regions of the world (Sherpa 2007). On one hand, labour migration improves economic conditions and ensures food security in terms of remittance (Kollmair et al. 2006); on the other hand, it has inadvertently created a vacuum in the mountain societies, putting extra responsibilities on women (Sherpa 2007). During 1991–2000, the level of adult male out-migration in the mountainous regions of South Asia exceeded 40% (Rasmussen and Parvez 2002). Draining away of productive human resource from mountains has serious implications not only for the economic development, but also for the enrichment of socio-cultural life in the region (Maithani 1996). Women, being natural resource developers, possess undocumented indigenous knowledge, and their contribution towards preserving the mountain cultures and natural resources is highly significant (ICIMOD 1999). However, the depletion of natural resource base has affected women adversely by increasing their workload and marginality (UNDP 2010). As a result, women play crucial role in mountain societies as major work force in food production system and as key players in the conservation and management of natural re80 P. C. Tiwari • B. Joshi sources and environments (FAO 2010, 2011). Globally, women share is nearly 43% of the work force in agricultural sector, and mountain regions of Asia, Africa, and Latin America it is above 50% (Sherpa 2007). The combined hardship and adversity of mountain living conditions trained the women to respond radically to the forces that were exploiting their natural resources and undermining their livelihoods. Rural women’s active participation in the conservation and management of their natural resources laid the foundation for the well known environmental movements in the seventies (Verma 2001). The famous 'Chipko Movement' (hugging the trees movement) of Uttarakhand – a distinctly non-violent grassroots movement – was organized and lead by illiterate rural women against the exploitative state forestry policy in 1970s. However, women in the Himalayas are particularly vulnerable to the impacts of environmental changes due to skewed power relations and inequitable cultural and social norms, as a result, they are often disadvantaged in terms of power relations and accessing resources, and exposed to increased risks associated with environmental changes (ICIMOD 2010). These risks include further marginalization, exclusion from decision-making and dislocation from access to resources for survival. Women generally have far less access to and control over the resources they manage and conserve (Sherpa 2007). The women of the Hindu Kush Himalayas of Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, China","Coffee is a very important agricultural commodity, produced in around 80 countries tropics, with an estimated 125 million people depending on it for their livelihoods in Latin America, Africa and Asia, with an annual production of around nine million tons of mung beans. Consisting of at least 125 species, the coffee genus (Rubiaceae, Ixoroideae, Coffeeae) is distributed in Africa, Madagascar, the Comoros Islands, the Mascarene Islands (La Réunion and Mauritius), tropical Asia, and Australia. Two species are economically important for the production of beverage coffee. arabica. (Arabica coffee) and. canephora. Froehner (robusta coffee). Higher quality of the drink is associated with arabica. Arabica coffee is a self-fertile tetraploid, which results in very low genetic diversity of this important crop. Coffee's genetic resources are rapidly disappearing due to various threats, such as human population pressure, leading to land conversion to agriculture, deforestation, and land degradation; low coffee prices, leading to the abandonment of coffee trees in forests and gardens in favor of other, more profitable crops; and climate change, which is causing increased pest and disease infestations, increased droughts, and unpredictable rainfall patterns. All of these factors threaten livelihoods in many coffee-producing countries. Interests in cocoa and coffee development may differ in their understanding of sustainable cocoa and coffee, their interests and their actions in advancing sustainable cocoa. This article analyzes the sustainability of cocoa and coffee at a large scale and analyzes the extent to which sustainability standards, policies, and development projects address sustainability issues and contribute to ecosystem services. This analysis is based on a literature review. Producers in the three countries and share concerns about price volatility, weak farmer organization and dependence on a few buyers. Producers in Sulawesi and the Central Region are compensating for low yields of cocoa and coffee production by diversifying cocoa and coffee systems. Public and private development actors are concerned about the low volume of production. Research so far has focused on biodiversity loss, which differs depending on the age of a country's cocoa and coffee sector. Development policies and programs in all countries have focused on expanding the cocoa and coffee sectors and increasing productivity, despite the need for smallholders for economically viable farming systems and existing market structures that yield little bargaining power for farmers. Sustainability standards have been spread unevenly and have converged on compliance criteria over time, although they differed in focus initially. Recently added business criteria and the development of sustainability standards have the potential to address smallholder concerns. Keywords: Cocoa and Coffee Beans, Sustainability Standards, Sustainable coffee and cocoa production.","This article sets out to unravel aspects of environmental changes in the Upper Tana during the second millennium AD. This aspect has not been adequately addressed in the Upper Tana. This makes it clear that a lacuna exists in the study of communities of the Upper Tana and the way they interact with their environment in the past and present times. The objective of this article is to evaluate the relationship between human activities and environmental change in the Upper Tana from AD 1000 to 1950. It is hypothesized that the advent of iron technology and its attendant economic activities led to the depletion of indigenous forests and the general environmental degradation. The article has employed archaeological, ethnographic, oral and historical methodologies to gather data on vegetation change in the Upper Tana and other related regions.  The article, argues that livestock grazing, iron smelting, slush and burn agriculture, and the clearing of forests for housing are key contributors to vegetation change in the Upper Tana.  Results from oral reconstruction of the past vegetation of the area, and using the plant succession theory, shows that the lowland area of the Upper Tana is actually savanna with scattered trees probably inhabited by grazers. It is posited that the above factors, together with persistent droughts have altered the vegetation cover of the area.  What we have today is colonization of less desirable stunted growth. The theory advanced here is that the vegetation change has been a result of human activities.  Overwhelmingly, results the study that the researcher carried out, showed that the causes of these changes have been socio-economically associated with the expansion of agricultural communities into the area; rather than through climatic factors. Colonisation and other forces of modernistion have also contributed to the underlying problem. The article concludes that anthropogenetic factors have greatly contributed to environmental change in the upper Tana. Certainly, environmental change is a global phenomenon that has elicited research interests due to its negative impacts on human population. It is recommended that knowledge of environmental change in the past should be used to extrapolate modern environmental challenges affecting African ecosystems.","The article examines the perspectives of summit diplomacy in relations between Russia and the countries of the African region. Summit diplomacy in the context of this article can be considered as an integral part of multi-vector network diplomacy, which is an effective addition, and sometimes an alternative to traditional diplomacy, despite the fact that officials also take part in the summits. The authors note that in studies on the diplomacy of summits, insufficient attention is paid to the substantive aspects of the relations between their participants. Thus, the summits imply consideration of a wide range of tasks, including those of a domestic political nature. At the same time, as an instrument of foreign policy, the effectiveness of summit diplomacy depends not only on the structural characteristics of relations, but also on the dynamics of interaction between the participants. The countries of the African region have rich mineral deposits, vast areas that could potentially be suitable for highly productive agriculture; forests, including the most valuable species of trees, as well as a huge population, which can become the basis for one of the world's largest markets for goods and services. It is African countries that occupy the first places in terms of GDP growth prospects and the rapidly growing economy as a whole. Transnational corporations have long been fighting for control over resources, access to cheap labor and the population's money, increasing their presence on the continent. In this regard, Africa has become the object of special attention of leading international players, including Russia. Thus, at present, a certain return of Russia's real interest in Africa is being ascertained. In the first part of the article, the authors analyze the economic opportunities of Russia and its main interests in relations with the countries of the African region. The second part deals with the development of Africa and the negotiating agenda of African states. The third part deals with new points of growth and promising areas of interaction between Russia and Africa.","Currently, ~65% of extant primate species (ca 512 species) distributed in 91 countries in the Neotropics, mainland Africa, Madagascar, South Asia and Southeast Asia are threatened with extinction and 75% have declining populations as a result of deforestation and habitat loss resulting from increasing global market demands, and land conversion for industrial agriculture, cattle production and natural resource extraction. Other pressures that negatively impact primates are unsustainable bushmeat hunting, the illegal trade of primates as pets and as body parts, expanding road networks in previously isolated areas, zoonotic disease transmission and climate change. Here we examine current and future trends in several socio-economic factors directly or indirectly affecting primates to further our understanding of the interdependent relationship between human well-being, sustainable development, and primate population persistence. We found that between 2001 and 2018 ca 191 Mha of tropical forest (30% canopy cover) were lost as a result of human activities in the five primate range regions. Forty-six percent of this loss was in the Neotropics (Mexico, Central and South America), 30% in Southeast Asia, 21% in mainland Africa, 2% in Madagascar and 1% in South Asia. Countries with the greatest losses (ca 57% of total tree cover loss) were Brazil, Indonesia, DRC, China, and Malaysia. Together these countries harbor almost 50% of all extant primate species. In 2018, the world human population was estimated at ca 8bn people, ca 60% of which were found in primate range countries. Projections to 2050 and to 2100 indicate continued rapid growth of the human populations in these five primate range regions, with Africa surpassing all the other regions and totaling ca 4bn people by the year 2100. Socioeconomic indicators show that, compared to developed nations, most primate range countries are characterized by high levels of poverty and income inequality, low human development, low food security, high levels of corruption and weak governance. Models of Shared Socioeconomic Pathway scenarios (SSPs) projected to 2050 and 2100 showed that whereas practices of increasing inequality (SSP4) or unconstrained growth in economic output and energy use (SSP5) are projected to have dire consequences for human well-being and primate survivorship, practices of sustainability-focused growth and equality (SSP1) are expected to have a positive effect on maintaining biodiversity, protecting environments, and improving the human condition. These results stress that improving the well-being, health, and security of the current and future human populations in primate range countries are of paramount importance if we are to move forward with effective policies to protect the world’s primate species and promote biodiversity conservation.","Mankind is thought to have separated from a common ancestor shared with chimpanzees approximately 7 million years ago.1 At the time, among our ancestors was a group that decided to come down from the trees to live in the savanna as desertification of Africa's forests progressed. Although the term “ape-man” was used for early mankind who walked on two feet, improvements in the precision of dating methods and excavations from the latter half of the 20th century made it clear that many types of human species coexisted. Thus, the term “ape-man” is now only rarely used. Bipedalism was likely something attempted by many groups, and although many theories exist, the underlying reason for this transition is unclear.2 However, the advantages are clear – it enabled viewing vast distances and the use of hands to carry food, and ultimately led to the expansion of brain size. Interestingly, it took our ancestors an additional 4 million years to expand their brain size. This evolutionary delay might have been caused by climate changes in Africa. The progressively drying climate led to reductions in forestland, and our ancestors who lived on the plains were subjected to a new type of natural selection pressure, causing changes in their physique and behavior. One possible reason that orangutans remained in the trees when transported to Asia by continental drift was that although Africa and the Northern hemisphere began to dry and cool from approximately 30 million to 2.5 million years ago, Asia's forests in the tropical regions remained intact. Evidence of brain size expansion and the use of tools can be found from approximately 2.5 million years ago. Mankind at this stage is referred to as Homo habilis or Homo rudolfensis. The concept of pre-adaptation refers to gradually altering physique in advance so that it works to one's advantage once subjected to a particular environment. For instance, the advantages of walking erect are thought to have played an important role in the evolution of mankind much later; that is, approximately 2.5 million years later. The expansion of brain size also brought about a revolution in food energy, which accompanied the use of stone tools – the ability to ingest high caloric and nutritious meat products. Although they were “meat-eating” and hunted herbivorous animals on occasion, their meat supply likely came from food left over by carnivorous animals. In addition to increasing meat-eating efficiency, the expansion of brain size was accompanied by acquisition of modern man's physique, an expanded range of activity and loss of body hair. Although many human species remained in Africa, one group, the Peking man or Java man (also known as Homo erectus) moved to Eurasia approximately 1.8 million years ago in an event referred to as the first African exodus. At least one group of Homo erectus began using fire, a monumental event in mankind's history. Homo erectus existed until 250 000 years ago. We enter the age of modern man from approximately 200 000 years ago. The Neanderthals were another species of man that coexisted with modern humans during this period. This period saw the use of symbols, language and original art-forms. One group of modern humans left Africa approximately 100 000 years ago, and eventually adapted to all global environments in an event famously known as the second African exodus. Many terrains were conquered, including grasslands, deserts and mountains, and humans began living under various climates (tropical, temperate and polar). The conquering of various terrains is evidenced by the existence of Eskimos in polar regions, Bushmen in the deserts, Pygmies in the tropical rain forests, and Tibetan highlanders. The spreading of humans was particularly fast, with humans reaching Europe, Asia, North and South America, and Australia within the span of tens of thousands of years. Mankind at the time formed small nomadic groups and lived as hunter-gatherers. From a modest population of approximately 100 000 about 1 million years ago, the global population dramatically increased to 500 000 about 200 000 years ago, and further to approximately 10 million with the advent of agriculture about 10 000 years ago.3",13.6354086478466,4,"popul, research, project"

We formally characterise and name this species as Deinbollia onanae (Sapindaceae-Litchi clade) and we discuss it in the context of the assemblage of montane tree species in the Cameroon Highlands of West-Central Africa. The new species is a shade-bearing, non-pioneer understorey forest tree species reaching 15 m high and a trunk diameter that can attain over 40 cm at 1.3 m above the ground. Seed dispersal has been recorded by chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes ellioti) and by putty-nose monkeys (Cercopithecus nictitans) and the species is used by chimpanzees for nesting. Cameroon has the highest species-diversity and species endemism known in this African-Western Indian Ocean genus of 42, mainly lowland species. Deinbollia onanae is an infrequent tree species known from six locations in surviving islands of montane (sometimes also upper submontane) forest along the line of the Cameroon Highlands, including one at Ngel Nyaki in Mambilla, Nigeria. Deinbollia onanae is here assessed as Endangered according to the IUCN 2012 standard, threatened by severe fragmentation of its mountain forest habitat due to extensive and ongoing clearance for agriculture. The majority of the 28 tree species of montane forest (above 2000 m alt.) in the Cameroon Highlands are also widespread in East African mountains (i.e. are Afromontane wide). Deinbollia onanae is one of only seven species known to be endemic (globally restricted to) these highlands. It is postulated that this new species is morphologically closest to Deinbollia oreophila, a frequent species at a lower (submontane) altitudinal band of the same range. Detailed ecological data on Deinbollia onanae from the Nigerian location, Ngel Nyaki, where it has been known under the name Deinbollia “pinnata”, is reviewed.","Background and epidemiology: Yellow fever is a viral hemmorhagic fever endemic in jungle areas and, less commonly, urban areas of South America and Africa. It is caused by a flavivirus that is passed to humans inadvertently through the bite of the Aedes aegypti mosquitoes (urban cycle) or of Haemagogus or other forest-canopy species of mosquitoes (jungle or forest cycle). Endemicity is maintained by the presence of the vector (mosquitoes) and nonhuman primates (monkeys) as the zoonotic focus.1 According to estimates by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 1998, each year about 200 000 people become ill with yellow fever worldwide, but the true incidence is likely much higher. About 90% of cases occur in Africa and 10% in South America. In South America this disease manifests primarily in nonhuman primates, with the peak transmission between January and March, particularly in areas cleared of trees for habitation and agriculture. South America has been epidemic-free since 1942 because of a successful A. aegypti eradication program, but the threat of resurgence remains. In Africa, transmission occurs in the tropical rain forest, moist savannah and contiguous dry savannah areas. Peak transmission occurs in the rainy season and early dry season from July through October. Between 1979 and 2002 there were 10 reported cases of imported yellow fever in returning travellers, reflecting increasing global travel to endemic areas.2 The incubation period for yellow fever is generally 3–6 days. Classic illness passes through 3 defined phases: infection, remission and intoxication. Not all cases progress through the 3 phases. Mild illness characterized by fever, prostration, headache, myalgia, abdominal pain and vomiting may resolve immediately and permanently following the period of infection. More severe cases may progress through a period of remission, marked by a sudden fall in fever lasting several hours or days, to intoxication. The period of intoxication presents with jaundice, azotemia, oliguria, myocardial, renal and hepatic involvement, encephalopathy and hemorrhage, characterized by hematemesis. People with yellow fever have a 10% mortality rate; this rate may climb as high as 50% in cases of hemorrhagic fever. People of all ages are equally susceptible, but in epidemics those who are too young to have been immunized during previous epidemics are more vulnerable. A large proportion of cases worldwide are in men aged 15–45, reflecting occupational exposure through forestry or agricultural work in mosquito-ridden jungle areas. Unlike other hemorrhagic fevers, yellow fever is not directly transmitted from person to person. Impoverished areas with poor health care, limited access to immunization and limited resources for reducing exposure to mosquitoes have the highest rates of cases. Clinical management: Three questions on patient history that could suggest yellow fever are outlined in Table 1.3 Signs during the infection phase include fever, Faget's sign (bradycardia in relation to fever), conjuctival injection, facial flushing, coated tongue with pink edges and leukopenia. Abrupt resolution of fever and other signs may indicate the period of remission. Signs of intoxication include icterus, hemorrhage (e.g., epistaxis, hematemesis, melena, metrorrhagia), albuminuria (day 3 or 4), azotemia, shock and encephalopathy. Encephalopathy is not uncommon, with patients usually dying within 7–10 days of onset. Table 1 A number of laboratory tests can be supportive in making the diagnosis of yellow fever (Table 2). Serologic testing can definitively diagnose yellow fever in a single sample by early testing for immunoglobulin M by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) or in paired acute and convalescent sera samples. The ELISA method is preferred because of its sensitivity and relative specificity, but neutralization tests provide the highest specificity. Table 2 Liver biopsies show a characteristic but not diagnostic midzone necrosis with sparing of hepatocytes around the central vein and portal triad. Viral antigen has been found in degenerating hepatocytes and Councilman bodies. Treatment is supportive; it should involve intensive care in severe cases and consultation with infectious disease specialists. Prevention: Yellow fever is readily prevented by vaccinating residents of and travellers to endemic zones. The yellow fever vaccine is a live attenuated strain of the yellow fever virus (17D) developed by Theiler and Smith in 1927. The WHO currently approves only 5 manufacturers of the yellow fever vaccine. Countries located in yellow fever endemic areas may officially require proof of yellow fever vaccination as a condition of entry under WHO international health regulations. There are also countries outside of the endemic areas that may require proof of vaccination because such yellow fever-free countries have the appropriate climatic and entomologic conditions to initiate and maintain a yellow fever transmission cycle. Travellers are asked to consult travel medicine specialists for specific requirements. The vaccine is approved for children older than 9 months, but because it is an attenuated live vaccine it is contraindicated in pregnancy though safe for breastfeeding mothers. It is generally contraindicated in immunocompromised people, though individual risk assessments are necessary for such cases. Waivers approved by the WHO can be provided to travellers with contraindications for the vaccine by certified travel medicine centres. Such patients should be counselled on prevention methods. The yellow fever vaccine has a long record of safety, but clinicians should be aware of 2 severe complications from the vaccine. Yellow fever-associated neurotropic disease (previously known as postvaccine encephalitis), most common in infants, occurs 7–21 days after vaccination. Of the 1/8 000 000 people who contract this disease, full recovery is typical. Yellow fever-associated viscerotropic disease occurs 2–5 days after vaccination. It is characterized by fever, myalgia, arthralgia, increased liver enzymes and bilirubin, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, disseminated intravascular coagulation, hypotension, oliguria and rhabdomyolysis. There have been 13 cases reported out of over 100 million doses administered worldwide.4 The vaccine should be given no less then 10 days before departure, and revaccination should occur every 10 years. The vaccine should only be administered by certified vaccine centres knowledgeable in travel medicine and vaccine reaction management, particularly if concurrent administration of other vaccines is indicated, because these may need to be staggered. People with an allergy to egg proteins or gelatin should not be given the yellow fever vaccine.4 Erica Weir Associate Medical Officer of Health Kingston, Frontenac and Lennox & Addington Health Unit Kingston, Ont.

Deinbollia onanae is an infrequent tree species known from five locations in surviving islands of montane (or upper submontane) forest along the line of the Cameroon Highlands. It is here assessed as Endangered according to the IUCN 2012 standard, threatened mainly by clearance of forest for agriculture. The majority of tree species characteristic of montane forest (above 2000 m alt.) in the Cameroon Highlands are also widespread in East African mountains (i.e. are Afromontane). Deinbollia onanae is one of only a very small number of species that are endemic (globally restricted to) the mountain range. It is postulated that this new species is in a sister relationship with Deinbollia oreophila, which is a frequent species of a lower (submontane) altitudinal band of the same range. It is further postulated that seed dispersal is or was by frugivorous birds, potentially turacos, alternatively by primates such as Preuss s monkey.","Monanthotaxis bali is the only known, solely montane (occurring solely above 2000 m alt.) species of the genus. It joins Monanthotaxis orophila (Rwanda) and M. discolor (Tanzania), two other species that can also occur above 2000 m alt. Monanthotaxis bali is an addition to the small number (28) of the tree species of the surviving montane forests of the Cameroon Highlands of which only eight other species are endemic. Due to its supra-axillary inflorescences, and petals arranged in one whorl but with the outer petals overlapping the inner petals distally, and rounded flower buds, the new species is placed in Hoekstra’s clade B of Monanthotaxis. The new species is unusual in being a treelet in a predominantly lianescent genus, and in lacking the glaucous underside of the leaf-blades that usually characterises the genus. Monanthotaxis bali takes the number of continental African species of the genus to 80, and makes Cameroon, with 30 species, the most species-diverse country for the genus. Monanthotaxis bali is known only from the Bali Ngemba Forest Reserve, a forest remnant under pressure of degradation and clearance in the Bamenda Highlands of Cameroon. It may already be extinct due to logging and agricultural activities. Here it is described, illustrated, mapped and assessed as Critically Endangered (Possibly Extinct) using the IUCN 2012 criteria.","Abstract: Vepris bali is the first known species of Vepris in WC Africa with opposite, trifoliolate leaves and is further unusual for its long petiolules.

This degradation process was attributed to charcoal production with a high degree of certainty, as evidence of kiln scars was found in more than 85% of sites sampled with high-resolution imagery across the study areas. The spatial and temporal pattern of mapped kiln scars exposed an intense and fast-paced degradation process, with kiln densities reaching 2.3 kiln/ha, removal of about 79.3% of the aboveground biomass and reductions of 74.2% of tree cover. The analysis revealed that this forest degradation process progressively moves further away from urban centers. In the year 2010, charcoal production took place around 190 km away from Lusaka, whereas extraction areas in 2020 were located around 350 km from this city. These results underline the negative impact of charcoal production on forest resources and question its characterization as localized and periurban. The post-disturbance LCLUC trajectories of degraded woodlands in forest reserves revealed a partial conversion to agricultural land over time, with less than 25% of these woodlands cultivated seven years after charcoal production. The disaggregation of the supply sources of charcoal for the city of Lusaka based on consumption figures and remote sensing deforestation records showed that the charcoal generated as a byproduct of agricultural expansion is not enough to meet the annual charcoal demand of Lusaka. On the contrary, the majority (65%) of this charcoal is the result of a forest degradation process that alters 197.4 km2 of miombo woodlands annually. These findings highlight the role of charcoal production as a direct driver of forest degradation and suggest that forest degradation resulting from charcoal production has surpassed deforestation due to agricultural expansion as the main tree cover loss process in Zambia. These results provide data-driven evidence to improve the characterization of forest degradation resulting from charcoal production across the woodlands of southern Africa and aid the REDD + monitoring, reporting and verification systems in compliance with international reporting commitments.","Seedling production nurseries have been receiving much attention because of increasing demand for seedlings. In sub-Saharan Africa studies have showed over 50% of smallholder seedlings planted were sourced in tree nurseries. This has caused a rise in need to improve quality of seedlings especially focused on production level. The focus on most studies on early growth performance of selected key species important either for commercial plantation or agroforestry has been varied on length of the study periods and measurement parameters, with the focus never being to compare the farmer practices with the industry. This study main objective is to determine the effect of growing media on early growth performance of Grevillea robusta and Cupressus lusitanica seedlings in the highlands of Kenya. These species from literature have shown abundance in terms of demand and availability in smallholder tree nurseries and received complaints on varied performance. The parameters under observation were height, branch numbers, leaf numbers and survival of the seedlings of these species over a six-month period. There were 13 treatments which included various soil mixtures as follows: Agricultural soil (A), Forest soil (FS), Farmyard Manure (FYM), and Sand (S) and their combinations. The study employed a Completely Randomized Design with total of 390 seedlings per species. The performance showed that the soil mixture with the combined mean cumulative highest survival was FS 78±3.2% and combined mean lowest cumulative survival was A+S+FYM (37±4.2%). Cupressus lusitanica performed better in survival (70±1.2%), height (171±8.1mm), branch numbers (25±1.1), and leaf numbers (119±12.1), when compared to Grevillea robusta survival (38±1.6%), height (57±4.0mm), branch numbers (2±0.2), and leaf numbers (13±1.1%) in the nursery. Different soil mixtures had performed differently for each of the parameters in the study with key observation was FS+FYM+S was the best performing for C. lusitanica height, branching, leaf numbers and survival. The study also observed FS was best performing for the survival of G. robusta in the nursery. This study demonstrates that seedlings in the nursery for these two species require different soil mixtures to ensure survival and high growth performance.","To contribute to the development of methods for the sustainable management of forest ecosystems in Central Africa, the following research question was addressed: can analyses of land cover change help to understand and document the spatial organization and mechanisms of forest degradation? To answer this question in the Democratic Republic of Congo, the Makala project mapped the tree and forest resources of Kinshasa's wood-fuel supply basin and attempted to predict how they would evolve in the future. Maps were made for four periods (1984, 2001, 2006 and 2012) using a mosaic of four LANDSAT images. The above-ground biomass was estimated in 2012 using forest inventories in 317 plots distributed across the four types of plant cover found on the Bateke plateau (4,337 trees and 44 species were recorded). This inventory data combined with the satellite data allowed us to make the first comprehensive assessment of above-ground biomass in the study area. Between 2000 and 2012, the average volume of wood-fuel fell by more than 50%. Over the entire period studied (1984 to 2012), carbon stocks fell by 75%. In the wood-fuel supply area for Kinshasa, the drastic loss of forest cover, shortened fallow periods, savannah encroachment and the decline of biomass and carbon stocks are clear signals of degradation. However, these initial estimations were derived from a small sample that was extrapolated to the entire supply area. It would be very useful to increase sampling in order to obtain more accurate and realistic figures. The experience of the Makala project clearly shows that the analysis of land cover change helps to understand and document the spatial organization and mechanisms of forest degradation. However, only with a sound wood-fuel resource policy and sustainable community land management, combined with very dynamic tree reintroduction on agricultural land, will it be possible to initiate a sustainable process of restoration.

Nine strict endemics, and 11 near endemics are now documented, a drop from the number recorded after the first survey in 2004, since when five of the provisionally named species have been formally published. We test the hypothesis that a further one of the provisionally named putative Bali Ngemba new species, Vepris sp. A, an 8 – 20 m tall tree from cloud forest in the 1310 – 1600 m altitudinal band, is indeed new to science. We compare it morphologically with other multicarpellate, apocarpous, trifoliolate Cameroon tree species formerly placed in the genus Oricia Pierre until they were subsumed into Vepris by Mziray (1992). These are Vepris trifoliolata (Engl.) Mziray and V. gabonensis (Pierre) Mziray. We conclude that Vepris sp. A is a new undescribed species here named as Vepris onanae. The new species is illustrated, mapped and its conservation status assessed as Endangered using the 2012 IUCN standard due to the threats of habitat clearance from agricultural pressures at its three locations all of which remain formally unprotected. Vepris onanae appears unique among the Guineo-Congolian African oricioid species of Vepris in occurring in cloud forest, the other species, apart from V. renierii of the Albertine Rift, occurring in lowland forest. It also differs in the very broad, (7.8 –) 11.3 – 18 cm wide leaflets of the flowering stems which have a 6-18(−30) mm long, narrowly triangular acumen (vs leaflets <12 cm wide, acumen absent or short) and in having both subsessile and pedicellate (pedicels 0.25 – 0.3 mm long and 1(– 2) mm long) male flowers (vs male flower pedicels all sessile, or all c. 3 mm long). We report for the first time on stage-dependent leaf heteromorphy in Vepris and characterise a level of sexual dimorphism more advanced than usual in the genus. We highlight the importance of protecting Bali Ngemba and other forest patches in the Bamenda Highlands if species such as Vepris onanae are not soon to become extinct.",17.7136158928889,3,"wood, stock, tree_speci"

Land is a principal factor of production, a source of life and livelihoods. It provides a means of living and a variety of uses such as agricultural, human settlement, environmental conservation, urban and industrial development purposes among others. These uses compete for space in a fixed area, hence the rising land use conflicts and degradation. The situation has threatened lives and livelihoods, making it difficult to plan for the livelihood activities in the County. This is happening against the backdrop of land use policy changes including; sessional paper no 3 of 2009 on the National Land Policy, the Constitution of Kenya 2010, the Land Act, 2012, the Land Registration Act, 2012, the Community Land Act, 2016 and sessional paper no 1 of 2017 on National Land Use Policy that were intended to alleviate the situation. This situation is now a major threat to the livelihood of the local communities in Baringo County. This study, therefore, sought to examined the dynamics of land use changes on the livelihood of the local communities in Baringo county with specific objective to establish the drivers of the changes. A comprehensive desk review of existing literature was done, and land use changes were descriptively analyzed. The review spanned from pre-colonial (before 1895), colonial (1895 to 1963), independence (1963 to 2010) including the subsequent years of land reforms following the promulgation of the Constitution of Kenya 2010 onwards to 2020. The study found that the key drivers of land use changes originate from the change of land use policies from customary to European-like systems during the colonial era (1895 to 1963). These drivers revolve around the conflicts in the application of land use policies and laws, dual production system (different land use for registered private land in arable areas and the unregistered community land in non-arable areas within the county) occasioning wide productivity gap and economic disparity. Further the knowledge gaps associated with colonial perceptions, ideologies, and attitudinal International Journal of Academic Research in Business and Social Sciences Vol. 1 1 , No. 9, 2021, E-ISSN: 2222-6990 © 2021 HRMARS 562 practices, which led to misconception and wrong policies aggravated the situation. The consequences disorganize the local community land use and social system, broke down the traditional grazing and cropping patterns, depleted soils fertility & degraded the environment. In addition, the study found out that in the unregistered community land, land use conflicts were rampant, and characterized by invaded and claim interest as well as unscrupulous legal manipulation of land ownership records leading to dispossession. These two salient features are the main drivers of land use changes that led to continuous and frequent fatal inter-ethnic land use conflicts among the local communities; causing displacement and destruction of property among other atrocities working against politically weak local community. This scenario destabilized livelihood possibilities making it difficult for local communities to engage in basic livelihood activities and create uncertainty for future development. The study concluded that the security of land tenure perpetrates land use conflicts particularly in the unregistered community land. The government, therefore, need to register the community land to enhance land tenure security in the county. Background of the Study The background of the study covers introduction, problem statement, objectives Introduction Globally, land resource is the basis of human livelihood, since it provides basic needs such as food, water, energy, clothing and shelter. It allows for a variety of uses including agricultural production, human settlement and environmental conservation to preserve it for posterity, and can satisfy a diverse range of local communities’ livelihood objectives. All these uses of land resource compete for space in a fixed land area within an ever-changing environment. In addition, it is a finite resource and increasingly becoming scarce over time. The ensuing competition and growing forces at work necessitates government intervention through land use policy in order to harmonize the various uses. Moreover, in practice, it is difficult to arrive to an equilibrium between the various uses without an external force. Therefore, the unfolding scenario leads to land use changes problems, which calls for government intervention through land use policies. Land use policy is intended to balance users demands, facilitate production and sustain livelihood for the local communities and at same time guarantee political stability. In this study, dynamics of land use changes is defined as policy changes and the resultant consequences. In Africa, dynamics of land use changes evolved through various transformations associated with government policies adopted by different political regimes. The changes were traced from the precolonial, colonial and post-colonial eras. Each of these eras introduced changes in land use policies that shape up different social, economic and political realities on the livelihood of the local communities. Livelihood is defined as comprising the capabilities, assets (including both material and social resources) and activities required for a means of living by the local communities (Scones, 2008). Livelihood is sustainable when it can cope with the policy changes, and recover from, stresses and shocks arising from it, maintain or enhance local communities’ capabilities, assets and activities, while not undermining the natural resources base. In this case, land resource represents the natural resource base, and the capacity of the local communities to use it to generate and maintain their means of living, enhance their well-being and preserve it for future generations is dependent on policy changes. These changes influence greatly the livelihood outcomes of the local communities. International Journal of Academic Research in Business and Social Sciences Vol. 1 1 , No. 9, 2021, E-ISSN: 2222-6990 © 2021 HRMARS 563 In this respect, local communities are indigenous populations who reside and derive their livelihood from land resource. They consider land resource as the principal factor of production and the source of livelihood because it provides basic needs such as food, water, energy, clothing and shelter. Land resource also allows for a variety of uses including agricultural, human settlement and environmental conservation that satisfy a diverse range of livelihood objectives for local communities. In Kenya, dynamics of land use changes emanates largely from colonial regime actions and policies, which continued in slightly modified manner after independence (Thuo, 2013). Before the colonial era (before 1895), land use was managed through African local communities’ customary laws. Land use and management practices were guided and controlled by established regulations and procedures among various local communities (Thuo, 2013). Land use was organized into specific areas of agricultural (crops and livestock), human settlement, environmental conservation uses and heritage sites, among others. Most of the land resource was owned by the entire community while individual community members had only user rights (Thuo, 2013). The land use was communal, small-scale subsistence in nature, stable and sustainable in terms of provision for local communities’ livelihood and environmental conservation needs. The period depicts a close economy without government intervention in terms of land use policy changes. Local communities enjoy territorial niches with boundaries defined by specific geographical and physical features such as rivers, mountains, trees, and valleys. The ethnic community chiefs, assisted by the Council of elders, had the power to make land use decisions. Land use was assumed to operate in a dynamic equilibrium checked by raids and natural disasters such as war, disease outbreaks, earthquakes and famines. Soil fertility was maintained through shift cultivation with adequate fallow periods of three (3) years or more required to restore soil structure and fertility. Much of the uncultivated land was used as pastoral communities grazing areas. Forested areas were used for hunting, trapping and honey gathering. Periodic droughts checked Land use and inter communities’ raids to maintain the dynamic equilibrium. During colonial era(1895 to 1963), the colonial government took over the control of land use from the local communities through violence, trickery, and mutual agreements (Thuo, 2013). It dismantled the ethnic community territorial niches and nationalized land use. All land in Kenya became Crown Land. All local communities were dispossessed, and customary land use laws by the local communities were rendered redundant. All existing land use rights by the local communities were at the mercy of the colonial power (Okoth-Ogendo, 1995). Therefore, the genesis of land use problems in Kenya. Fundamentally, the land use policy changes were biased and oriented to benefit European settlers with scant attention to local communities. The land use policies created a dual land use system where the European colonists occupy the high rainfall and fertile areas, employing modern land use practices based on individuals’ decisions. At the same time, the local communities were restricted to native reserves in the drier regions, where local communities were allowed to continue with collective land use decisions. These land use changes promoted economic disparity between European settler and local communities during colonial era. Land use policies promoted high productivity land use practices for European white farmers, while encouraging low productivity traditional land use practices for local communities. The land use policy c","Agroforestry is one of the most conspicuous land use systems across landscapes and agro ecological zones in Africa. Some of the components of Agroforestry systems are; home garden agroforestry, alley cropping, forest farming, wind break, river banks, park land, crop land trees and buffer zones agroforestry practices. Climate change impacts by complex weather-related phenomena have threatened agricultural and forest ecosystems and the livelihood of agricultural and local communities. Agroforestry has an important role in climate change adaptation through diversified land-use practices, sustainable livelihoods, sources of income, enhanced forest and agricultural productivity and reduced weather-related production losses, which enhance resilience against climate impacts. Like few other land use options, agroforestry has real potential to contribute to food security, climate change mitigation and adaptation, while preserving and strengthening the environmental resource base of Africa’s rural landscapes. It has a key role to play in landscape-scale mitigation schemes under the REDD+or AFOLU (Agriculture, Forestry and other land uses) concepts. Home garden agroforestry system indicates that adaptation and mitigation to climate change will largely depend on the increased resilience of both agroforestry systems and of local management capacity. Despite less attention has been given to tree based land use option, agroforestry has played a major role in reducing household vulnerability to shocking. Smallholder farmers have already started mainstreaming tree based land use system as resilience to social needs because the poor are more exposed to change; Agroforestry is one of best risk aversion option to make them move out of food insecurity. Generally, agroforestry systems readily bundle both mitigation and adaptation strategies and provide several pathways to securing food security for poor farmers, while contributing to climate change mitigation. Agroforestry should attract more attention in global agendas on climate adaptation and mitigation because of its positive social and environmental impacts.","The Maasai Mara and the wider Mau River Basin in East Africa provide fundamental ecosystem services that support people, wildlife, livestock and agriculture. The historical indigenous land use of the Mara and wider Mau basin was wildlife conservation and pastoralism with highland agriculture. However, land policy changes, the rise of community conservancies and the increase in human populations have mediated unprecedented land use shifts over time. We analyze land use and land cover change (LULCC) trends from 1990 to 2040 in the Mara and the wider Mau River Basin landscape. The study examines land use and land cover change trends, establishes factors driving the trends, and assesses the implications of these trends on biodiversity. Multi-temporal satellite images, together with physical and social economic data, were collated to generate future scenarios for transitions for forest, shrubland, grassland, cropland, wetlands and built-up areas between 1990 and 2040. Agricultural expansion is the chief driver of LULCC in the Mara and the wider Mau River Basin, particularly since 2015. There was insignificant change to the forest cover after 2015, which was in part due to government intervention on forest encroachment and boundaries. The anthropogenic choice of tilling the land in the basin caused a decline in grasslands, forests and expanded shrublands, particularly where there was clear tree cutting in the Mau forest. Land use and land cover trends have generated undesirable impacts on ecosystem services that support wildlife conservation.","Abstract. Agricultural catchments in the tropics often generate high concentrations of suspended sediments following the conversion of natural ecosystems. The eroded fine particles are generally enriched with carbon (TC) and nutrients (TN and TP) originating from the topsoil of agricultural land. Sediment-associated TC, TN and TP are an important loss to the terrestrial ecosystem and tightly connected to an increase in riverine particulate TC and nutrient export. Soil nutrient depletion can limit crop growth and yields, whereas an excess of nutrients in streams can cause eutrophication in freshwater systems. Streams in East Africa, with widespread land conversion from forests to agriculture, are expected to receive high loads of sediment-associated TC, TN and TP. In this study, we assess the effect of land use on particulate TC, TN and TP concentrations. Suspended sediments (time-integrated, manual-event-based and automatic-event-based sediment samples) were analysed for TC, TN and TP concentrations collected at the outlet of a natural montane forest (35.9), a tea-tree plantation (33.3) and a smallholder agriculture (27.2 km2) catchment in western Kenya during a wet sampling period in 2018 and a drier sampling period in 2019. Particulate TC, TN and TP concentrations were up to 3-fold higher (p<0.05) in the natural forest catchment compared to fertilized agricultural catchments. However, because of higher sediment loads from the smallholder agriculture catchment, the total sediment-associated loads of TC, TN and TP were higher compared to the natural forest and tea-tree plantation catchment. The higher C:N ratios in the natural forest suggest that the particulate nutrients are of organic origin due to tighter nutrient cycles, whereas lower ratios in both agricultural catchments suggest a mixture of mineral and organic sediment sources. The findings of this study imply that with the loss of natural forest, the inherent soil fertility is progressively lost under the current low fertilization rates and soil management strategies.","Land use change is known to affect suspended sediment fluxes in headwater catchments. There is however limited empirical evidence of the magnitude of these effects for montane catchments in East Africa. We collected a unique 4‐year high‐frequency data set and assessed seasonal sediment variation, water pathways, and sediment response to hydrology in three catchments under contrasting land use in the Mau Forest Complex, Kenya's largest tropical montane forest. Annual suspended sediment yield was significantly higher in a smallholder agriculture‐dominated catchment (131.5 ± 90.6 t km−2 yr−1) than in a tea‐tree plantation catchment (42.0 ± 21.0 t km−2 yr−1) and a natural forest catchment (21.5 ± 11.1 t km−2 yr−1) (p < 0.05). Transfer function models showed that in the natural forest and the tea‐tree plantations subsurface flow pathways delivered water to the stream, while in the smallholder agriculture shallow subsurface and surface runoff were dominant. There was a delayed sediment response to rainfall for the smallholder agriculture and the tea‐tree plantations. A slow depletion in sediment supply suggests that the wider catchment area supplies sediment, especially in the catchment dominated by smallholder farming. In contrast, a fast sediment response and depletion in sediment supply in the natural forest suggests a dominance of temporarily stored and nearby sediment sources. This study shows that the vegetation cover of a forest ecosystem is very effective in conserving soil, whereas catchments with more bare soil and poor soil conservation practices generated six times more suspended sediment yield. Catchment connectivity through unpaved tracks is thought to be the main explanation for the difference in sediment yield.","ABSTRACT Land systems are described based on various characteristics, including land cover composition and agricultural production. However, it is uncertain to what extent livestock, particularly monogastric livestock, determines land systems. We included monogastrics in a land system classification, and statistically analyzed the land cover composition and agricultural production of otherwise similar land systems with and without monogastric livestock. The results indicate that land systems with monogastrics are statistically different from their counterparts in the classification without monogastrics in terms of grassland area and crop yields, but are less different in terms of tree area, crop area, and ruminant livestock production. We then used a land systems map that includes monogastrics in the classification and a similar map that does not include monogastrics to project future changes in a novel manner that integrates livestock as a determinant of land systems. The results show that including monogastrics in otherwise similar projections yields less cropland intensification and more cropland expansion in several world regions, including Northern Africa and the Middle East. Other regions, such as Europe and Australia, were characterized by less decrease or more increase in tree area in the application with monogastrics, mainly due to the occurrence of open forests with monogastrics. This study prompts a call for improved characterization of land systems for land use and cover change (LUCC) assessments in order to better represent LUCC driven by monogastric livestock.","This study is focused on land use and land cover dynamics observed in Central River Region. It aims to determine the direction and rate of change in land use as a means of assessing the impact of climate change in Central River Region (CRR) of The Gambia. Decadal satellite images were used to measure changes in land use and land cover from 1984 to 2017 using supervised classification. Eight land use and land cover types were identified and mapped in this study namely: Crop lands, Gambia River, Halophytic vegetation, Irrigated crops, Mangrove, Settlement, Shrub/Wood savanna and Wooded savanna. The areas of crop lands, halophytic vegetation and settlement expanded between 1984 and 2017. River Gambia, irrigated crops, mangrove, shrub/wood savanna and wooded savanna areas decreased during the same period. Transition to less savanna was higher than transition to more settlement. In addition, physicochemical parameters were analyzed during the rainy and dry seasons for correlation with climate data. Socioeconomic surveys based on structured questionnaires were also conducted with 70 households in 6 villages in CRR. Land clearing for agriculture, tree cutting for firewood and charcoal, settlement and livestock grazing were mainly cited by the respondents as the main culprit inducing land cover change in CRR. This study shows that deforestation and forest degradation are still in progress despite the implementation of a management plan for a full rotation. We therefore proposed best management practices in order to control the agricultural clearing of land in the region such as agricultural intensification and soil fertility improvement.","This study evaluates relationships between contrasting land uses representing an anthropogenic impact gradient in a coastal agricultural catchment, and riparian vegetation, as reflected in changes in nutrient dynamics and water quality. The objectives were to: 1) determine the water and sediment quality emanating from variations in land cover using runoff plots and 2) examine the influence and effectiveness of the riparian vegetation in mediating nutrient fluxes from adjacent pastures. The contrasting land covers generated different runoff volumes, nutrient concentrations and associated loads. The indigenous forest demonstrated the lowest runoff volumes, the highest TN concentrations, but the lowest cumulative TN loads over the study period. Agriculture and alien Acacia mearnsii trees had the greatest impact on nutrient loads. The highest nutrient loads were recorded from the pastures (TN: 84.8 g m−2; NH4 +-N: 38.3 g m−2) and the alien invaded degraded riparian zone (TN: 100.7 g m−2; NH4 +-N: 55.6 g m−2). The nutrient loading was dependent on land cover, land use, rainfall amount and intensity and the associated surface runoff and a decreasing trend in nutrient concentrations was observed from the pastures to the riparian zones and to the river at all sites.","Abstract. Cultural eutrophication of coastal aquatic systems is a major undesired phenomenon of today, which is mainly ascribed to the application of inorganic fertilizers in agriculture. Consequently, dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) is considered the major problem and widely studied. However, human interventions also strongly influence the riverine dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) concentrations and fluxes. Studies of nutrient inputs from tropical river catchments are biased towards DIN, even though they account for only a portion of the total dissolved nitrogen (TDN) pool, whereas the rest is comprised of DON and has been largely ignored. The tropical Pamba River was studied because of its manifold human activities in the catchment and was sampled during the south west monsoon (SWM), north east monsoon (NEM) and the pre monsoon (PM) months during 2010 to 2013. The largest pilgrim center on earth, the Sabarimala temple, located in the upstream forest is a unique feature of the catchment. Fertilizer application, livestock farming and inadequate sewage treatment are the prevailing land use practices. The goals of this study were to (i) define cause-effect relationships by assessing the effect of various human interventions such as the pilgrims, agriculture and sewage disposal in combination with the seasonal variations in hydrology on the DON concentrations and fluxes and to (ii) quantify the inputs from respective land use segments. The global maximum DON concentration (29 302 μM) was measured for the Pamba River. Pilgrim activities, high population density, agricultural and livestock farming as well as the lack of infrastructure for sanitation facilities were the cause for extremely high DON concentrations and fluxes in the plantation and settlement with mixed tree crop (SMT) segments. A DON yield of 745 kg ha−1 yr−1 was calculated for the Pamba catchment. The total DON inputs from all quantifiable sources amounted to 514 kg ha−1 yr−1 comprising of 69% of the total Pamba DON yield. In the Pamba River, sewage is the major source of DON and the unique Sabarimala pilgrim event accounts for most of it. Nevertheless, sewage input from the rest of the densely-populated catchment is high, which is a common feature of developing countries that lack adequate sanitation and water technology, i.e. in South and Southeast Asia and tropical Africa. Our study shows that DON makes up a significant portion of anthropogenic nitrogen in rivers, in particular in those regions, which are, however, scarce in respective data. It underscores the need for more quantitative studies from densely-populated tropical river catchments in order to improve global nitrogen budgets and the assessment of the consequences of anthropogenic nitrogen inputs into coastal aquatic systems.","Land use changes are known to account for over 20% of human greenhouse gas emissions and tree cover losses can significantly influence land-climate dynamics. Land-climate feedbacks have been identified and evaluated for a long time. However, in addition to the direct effect of climate change on forest biomes, recent sparse evidence has shown that land use changes may increase as a result of weather shocks. In Western and Central Africa, agriculture is the main source of income and employment for rural populations. Economies rely on agricultural production, which is largely rainfed, and therefore dependent predominantly upon seasonal rainfall. In this article, I explore the impact of seasonal rainfall quality on deforestation, by combining high-resolution remotely-sensed annual tree cover loss, land cover, human activity and daily rainfall data. I show that in poor regions that are mainly reliant on rainfed agriculture, a bad rainy season leads to large deforestation shocks. These shocks notably depend on the proportion of agricultural land and on the remoteness of the areas in question, as remoteness determines the ability to import food and the existence of alternative income sources. In areas with significant forest cover, a short rainfall season leads to a 15% increase in deforestation. In unconnected areas with small proportions of crop area, the increase in deforestation reaches 20%. Findings suggest that a refined understanding of the land use changes caused by rainfall shocks might be used to improve the design and effectiveness of development, adaptation and conservation policies.",22.5523447151158,1,"soil, practic, land"
