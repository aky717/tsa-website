Changes in land cover have the potential to affect precipitation, the critical resource for production. Turbulent flux measurements from two eddy-covariance towers and additional observations from a dense network of small, wireless meteorological stations combine to relate land cover (savanna forest and agriculture) to evaporation in a small (3.5 km 2 ) catchment in Burkina Faso, West Africa. We observe larger sensible and latent heat fluxes over the savanna-forest in the headwater area relative to the agricultural section of the watershed. Fluxes above the savanna-forest are higher because of the greater number of exposed rocks and trees and the higher productivity of the forest compared to rainfed, hand-farmed agricultural fields. We deduce that there is a higher soil heat flux in the fields. Vegetation cover and soil moisture are found to be the primary controls of the evaporative fraction, defined as the latent heat over the available energy. Satellite derived vegetation index (NDVI) and soil moisture are determined to be good predictors of evaporative fraction. Our measurements provide an estimator that can be used to estimate evaporative fraction when only NDVI is available. Such large-scale estimates of evaporative fraction from remotely sensed data are valuable where ground-based measurements are lacking, which is the case across the African continent and many other semi-arid areas. Evaporative fraction estimates can be combined, for example, with sensible heat from measurements of temperature variance, to provide an estimate of evaporation when only minimal meteorological measurements are available in remote regions of the world. These findings reinforce local cultural beliefs of the importance of forest fragments for climate regulation and may provide support to local decision makers and rural farmers in the maintenance of the forest areas.","Rain-fed farming is the primary livelihood of semi-arid west Africa.

Employing a combination of machine learning and deep learning techniques, we developed a novel data fusion approach that integrated Digital Elevation Model (DEM) data, MODIS satellite imagery, WOSIS soil profile data, and CHELSA environmental data. This combined dataset, named GeoBlendMDWC, was specifically designed for SOC prediction. The primary aim of this research is to develop and evaluate a novel optimization algorithm for accurate SOC prediction by leveraging multi-source environmental data. Specifically, this study aims to (1) create an integrated dataset combining remote sensing and ground data for comprehensive SOC analysis, (2) develop a new optimization technique that enhances both machine learning and deep learning model performance, and (3) evaluate the algorithm’s efficiency and accuracy against established optimization methods like Jaya and GridSearchCV. This study focused on India, Australia, and South Africa, countries known for their significant agricultural activities. We introduced a novel optimization technique for both machine learning and deep neural networks, comparing its performance to established methods like the Jaya optimization technique and GridSearchCV. The models evaluated included XGBoost Regression, LightGBM, Gradient Boosting Regression (GBR), Random Forest Regression, Decision Tree Regression, and a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) model. Our research demonstrated that the proposed optimization algorithm consistently outperformed existing methods in terms of execution time and performance. It achieved results comparable to GridSearchCV, reaching an R2 of 90.16, which was a significant improvement over the base XGBoost model’s R2 of 79.08. In deep learning optimization, it significantly outperformed the Jaya algorithm, achieving an R2 of 61.34 compared to Jaya’s 30.04. Moreover, it was 20–30 times faster than GridSearchCV. Given its speed and accuracy, this algorithm can be applied to real-time data processing in remote sensing satellites. This advanced methodology will greatly benefit the agriculture and farming sectors by providing precise SOC predictions.","Fruit-tree crops generate food and income for local households and contribute to South Africa’s gross domestic product. Timely and accurate phenotyping of fruit-tree crops is essential for innovating and achieving precision agriculture in the horticulture industry. Traditional methods for fruit-tree crop classification are time-consuming, costly, and often impossible to use for mapping heterogeneous horticulture systems. The application of remote sensing in smallholder agricultural landscapes is more promising. However, intercropping systems coupled with the presence of dispersed small agricultural fields that are characterized by common and uncommon crop types result in imbalanced samples, which may limit conventionally applied classification methods for phenotyping. This study assessed the influence of balanced and imbalanced multi-class distribution and data-sampling techniques on fruit-tree crop detection accuracy. Seven data samples were used as input to adaptive boosting (AdaBoost), gradient boosting (GB), random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and eXtreme gradient boost (XGBoost) machine learning algorithms. A pixel-based approach was applied using Sentinel-2 (S2). The SVM algorithm produced the highest classification accuracy of 71%, compared with AdaBoost (67%), RF (65%), XGBoost (63%), and GB (62%), respectively. Individually, the majority of the crop types were classified with an F1 score of between 60% and 100%. In addition, the study assessed the effect of size and ratio of class imbalance in the training datasets on algorithms’ sensitiveness and stability. The results show that the highest classification accuracy of 71% could be achieved from an imbalanced training dataset containing only 60% of the original dataset. The results also showed that S2 data could be successfully used to map fruit-tree crops and provide valuable information for subtropical crop management and precision agriculture in heterogeneous horticultural landscapes.","Coffee is a very important agricultural commodity, produced in around 80 countries tropics, with an estimated 125 million people depending on it for their livelihoods in Latin America, Africa and Asia, with an annual production of around nine million tons of mung beans. Consisting of at least 125 species, the coffee genus (Rubiaceae, Ixoroideae, Coffeeae) is distributed in Africa, Madagascar, the Comoros Islands, the Mascarene Islands (La Réunion and Mauritius), tropical Asia, and Australia. Two species are economically important for the production of beverage coffee. arabica. (Arabica coffee) and. canephora. Froehner (robusta coffee). Higher quality of the drink is associated with arabica. Arabica coffee is a self-fertile tetraploid, which results in very low genetic diversity of this important crop. Coffee's genetic resources are rapidly disappearing due to various threats, such as human population pressure, leading to land conversion to agriculture, deforestation, and land degradation; low coffee prices, leading to the abandonment of coffee trees in forests and gardens in favor of other, more profitable crops; and climate change, which is causing increased pest and disease infestations, increased droughts, and unpredictable rainfall patterns. All of these factors threaten livelihoods in many coffee-producing countries. Interests in cocoa and coffee development may differ in their understanding of sustainable cocoa and coffee, their interests and their actions in advancing sustainable cocoa. This article analyzes the sustainability of cocoa and coffee at a large scale and analyzes the extent to which sustainability standards, policies, and development projects address sustainability issues and contribute to ecosystem services. This analysis is based on a literature review. Producers in the three countries and share concerns about price volatility, weak farmer organization and dependence on a few buyers. Producers in Sulawesi and the Central Region are compensating for low yields of cocoa and coffee production by diversifying cocoa and coffee systems. Public and private development actors are concerned about the low volume of production. Research so far has focused on biodiversity loss, which differs depending on the age of a country's cocoa and coffee sector. Development policies and programs in all countries have focused on expanding the cocoa and coffee sectors and increasing productivity, despite the need for smallholders for economically viable farming systems and existing market structures that yield little bargaining power for farmers. Sustainability standards have been spread unevenly and have converged on compliance criteria over time, although they differed in focus initially. Recently added business criteria and the development of sustainability standards have the potential to address smallholder concerns. Keywords: Cocoa and Coffee Beans, Sustainability Standards, Sustainable coffee and cocoa production.","Background and epidemiology: Yellow fever is a viral hemmorhagic fever endemic in jungle areas and, less commonly, urban areas of South America and Africa. It is caused by a flavivirus that is passed to humans inadvertently through the bite of the Aedes aegypti mosquitoes (urban cycle) or of Haemagogus or other forest-canopy species of mosquitoes (jungle or forest cycle). Endemicity is maintained by the presence of the vector (mosquitoes) and nonhuman primates (monkeys) as the zoonotic focus.1 According to estimates by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 1998, each year about 200 000 people become ill with yellow fever worldwide, but the true incidence is likely much higher. About 90% of cases occur in Africa and 10% in South America. In South America this disease manifests primarily in nonhuman primates, with the peak transmission between January and March, particularly in areas cleared of trees for habitation and agriculture. South America has been epidemic-free since 1942 because of a successful A. aegypti eradication program, but the threat of resurgence remains. In Africa, transmission occurs in the tropical rain forest, moist savannah and contiguous dry savannah areas. Peak transmission occurs in the rainy season and early dry season from July through October. Between 1979 and 2002 there were 10 reported cases of imported yellow fever in returning travellers, reflecting increasing global travel to endemic areas.2 The incubation period for yellow fever is generally 3–6 days. Classic illness passes through 3 defined phases: infection, remission and intoxication. Not all cases progress through the 3 phases. Mild illness characterized by fever, prostration, headache, myalgia, abdominal pain and vomiting may resolve immediately and permanently following the period of infection. More severe cases may progress through a period of remission, marked by a sudden fall in fever lasting several hours or days, to intoxication. The period of intoxication presents with jaundice, azotemia, oliguria, myocardial, renal and hepatic involvement, encephalopathy and hemorrhage, characterized by hematemesis. People with yellow fever have a 10% mortality rate; this rate may climb as high as 50% in cases of hemorrhagic fever. People of all ages are equally susceptible, but in epidemics those who are too young to have been immunized during previous epidemics are more vulnerable. A large proportion of cases worldwide are in men aged 15–45, reflecting occupational exposure through forestry or agricultural work in mosquito-ridden jungle areas. Unlike other hemorrhagic fevers, yellow fever is not directly transmitted from person to person. Impoverished areas with poor health care, limited access to immunization and limited resources for reducing exposure to mosquitoes have the highest rates of cases. Clinical management: Three questions on patient history that could suggest yellow fever are outlined in Table 1.3 Signs during the infection phase include fever, Faget's sign (bradycardia in relation to fever), conjuctival injection, facial flushing, coated tongue with pink edges and leukopenia. Abrupt resolution of fever and other signs may indicate the period of remission. Signs of intoxication include icterus, hemorrhage (e.g., epistaxis, hematemesis, melena, metrorrhagia), albuminuria (day 3 or 4), azotemia, shock and encephalopathy. Encephalopathy is not uncommon, with patients usually dying within 7–10 days of onset. Table 1 A number of laboratory tests can be supportive in making the diagnosis of yellow fever (Table 2). Serologic testing can definitively diagnose yellow fever in a single sample by early testing for immunoglobulin M by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) or in paired acute and convalescent sera samples. The ELISA method is preferred because of its sensitivity and relative specificity, but neutralization tests provide the highest specificity. Table 2 Liver biopsies show a characteristic but not diagnostic midzone necrosis with sparing of hepatocytes around the central vein and portal triad. Viral antigen has been found in degenerating hepatocytes and Councilman bodies. Treatment is supportive; it should involve intensive care in severe cases and consultation with infectious disease specialists. Prevention: Yellow fever is readily prevented by vaccinating residents of and travellers to endemic zones. The yellow fever vaccine is a live attenuated strain of the yellow fever virus (17D) developed by Theiler and Smith in 1927. The WHO currently approves only 5 manufacturers of the yellow fever vaccine. Countries located in yellow fever endemic areas may officially require proof of yellow fever vaccination as a condition of entry under WHO international health regulations. There are also countries outside of the endemic areas that may require proof of vaccination because such yellow fever-free countries have the appropriate climatic and entomologic conditions to initiate and maintain a yellow fever transmission cycle. Travellers are asked to consult travel medicine specialists for specific requirements. The vaccine is approved for children older than 9 months, but because it is an attenuated live vaccine it is contraindicated in pregnancy though safe for breastfeeding mothers. It is generally contraindicated in immunocompromised people, though individual risk assessments are necessary for such cases. Waivers approved by the WHO can be provided to travellers with contraindications for the vaccine by certified travel medicine centres. Such patients should be counselled on prevention methods. The yellow fever vaccine has a long record of safety, but clinicians should be aware of 2 severe complications from the vaccine. Yellow fever-associated neurotropic disease (previously known as postvaccine encephalitis), most common in infants, occurs 7–21 days after vaccination. Of the 1/8 000 000 people who contract this disease, full recovery is typical. Yellow fever-associated viscerotropic disease occurs 2–5 days after vaccination. It is characterized by fever, myalgia, arthralgia, increased liver enzymes and bilirubin, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, disseminated intravascular coagulation, hypotension, oliguria and rhabdomyolysis. There have been 13 cases reported out of over 100 million doses administered worldwide.4 The vaccine should be given no less then 10 days before departure, and revaccination should occur every 10 years. The vaccine should only be administered by certified vaccine centres knowledgeable in travel medicine and vaccine reaction management, particularly if concurrent administration of other vaccines is indicated, because these may need to be staggered. People with an allergy to egg proteins or gelatin should not be given the yellow fever vaccine.4 Erica Weir Associate Medical Officer of Health Kingston, Frontenac and Lennox & Addington Health Unit Kingston, Ont.

This study utilizes remote sensing data from 2001 to 2020 to compute drought indices categorized as meteorological, agricultural, and hydrological. A Gaussian kernel convolves these indices into a denoised, multi-band composite image. Further refinement with a Gaussian kernel enhances a single drought index from each category: Reconnaissance Drought Index (RDI), Soil Moisture Agricultural Drought Index (SMADI), and Streamflow Drought Index (SDI). The enhanced index, encompassing all bands, serves as a predictor for classification and regression tree (CART), support vector machine (SVM), and random forest (RF) machine learning models, further improving the three indices. CART demonstrated the highest accuracy and error minimization across all drought categories, with root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) values between 0 and 0.4. RF ranked second, while SVM, though less reliable, achieved values below 0.7. The results show persistent drought in the Sahel, North Africa, and southwestern Africa, with meteorological drought affecting 30% of Africa, agricultural drought affecting 22%, and hydrological drought affecting 21%.","Abstract. Addressing hunger is one of the greatest unsolved challenges Humanity has ever faced. Africa is one of the most fragile ecosystems strongly affected by numerous factors ranging from climate change, increasing population, decreasing water resources, and undeveloped hydrological infrastructure. These factors make it exceptionally vulnerable to food insecurity. The purpose of this study was to establish the feasibility and methodology of using Open Data Cube (ODC) and conventional machine learning algorithms to determine the extent of decrease in cropped area in the desert climate of Djibouti, the smallest Horn of Africa country (by landmass) over a thirty-year period. The research question was answered using Landsat 5, 7, and 8 imagery taken during the month of June from 1990, 2000, 2010, and 2020 then classified through machine learning algorithms - including decision tree and random forest. The data acquisition, analysis, and modeling were completed in an Open Data Cube environment using a cloud-based user computational platform running completely in-browser, and all necessary software was provided as part of the environment. The research identified a decreasing trend in vegetative areas but was limited in determining whether the vegetative areas were purely agricultural cropland in nature or included native vegetation. While the research reveals a concerning decline in total vegetation over the thirty-year period, the lack of other data variables (such as weather and climate patterns) provides too narrow a picture to determine causation. Several areas for further research are outlined.","Soil moisture (SM) is a fundamental constituent of the terrestrial environment and the hydrological cycle. Owing to its significant influence on catchment hydrological responses, it can be utilized as an indicator of floods and droughts to aid early warning systems. This study aimed to develop a field‐scale method to estimate SM using parametric and machine learning‐based methods to compare whether advanced artificial intelligence methods can give similar results as traditional methods. Considering this, monthly observed SM data (from the top 10 cm), environmental covariates, and remotely sensed data from March 2019 to July 2021 for the Cathedral Peak Research Catchments VI and IX in South Africa were obtained. From the 241 observations obtained across 12 sites, 160 (∼66%) were used for model training, while the remaining 81 (∼34%) were used for model testing. Employing 10‐fold cross‐validation, the individual machine learning models (viz., support vector machine [SVM], random forest (RF), k‐nearest neighbor, classification and regression trees [Rpart], and generalized linear model) displayed a satisfactory performance (R2 = 0.52–0.79; root mean square error = 3.79–5.80). In the validation phase, the RF model displayed a superior performance, followed by the SVM. Subsequent SM estimation using the hybrid model produced satisfactory results in training (R2 = 0.90) and testing (R2 = 0.45). The results obtained from this study can aid in predicting SM variations in catchments with limited monitoring. Furthermore, this model can be applied in drought monitoring, forecasting, and informing agricultural management practices.","Accurate estimates of cultivated area and crop yield are critical to our understanding of agricultural production and food security, particularly for semi-arid regions like the Sahel of West Africa, where crop production is mainly rain-fed and food security is closely correlated with the inter-annual variations in rainfall. Several global and regional land cover products, based on satellite remotely-sensed data, provide estimates of the agricultural land use intensity, but the initial comparisons indicate considerable differences among them, relating to differences in the satellite data quality, classification approaches, and spatial and temporal resolutions. Here, we quantify the accuracy of available cropland products across Sahelian West Africa using an independent, high-resolution, visually interpreted sample dataset that classifies all points across West Africa using a 2-km sample grid (~500,000 points for the study area). We estimate the “quantity” and “allocation” disagreements for the cropland class of eight land cover products in five Western Sahel countries (Burkina Faso, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, and Senegal). The results confirm that coarse spatial resolution (300 m, 500 m, and 1000 m) land cover products have higher disagreements in mapping the fragmented agricultural landscape of the Western Sahel. Earlier products (e.g., GLC2000) are less accurate than recent products (e.g., ESA CCI 2013, MODIS 2013 and GlobCover 2009). We also show that two of the finer spatial resolution maps (GFSAD30, and GlobeLand30) using advanced classification approaches (random forest, decision trees, and pixel-object combined) are currently the best available products for cropland identification. However, none of the eight land cover databases examined is consistent in reaching the targeted 75% accuracy threshold in the five Sahelian countries. The majority of currently available land cover products overestimate cultivated areas by an average of 170% relative to the cropland area in the reference data.",20.6895204154751,2,"result, resourc, natur"

This practice gets big attention with agroforestry and conservation scientists. The main purpose of this paper was to explore what are the main ecosystems services and livelihood strategy of parkland agroforestry provide to farming communities in West Africa region and the main challenges faced in conservation and management of the diversity of these trees in agricultural landscapes. What are the best practices and concerns towards parkland agroforestry in West African countries have and what lessons can be drawn to their counterparts in East African farming communities.The contributions and challenges of parkland agroforestry practices were described by different scholars. In West Africa`s region parklands as anthropogenic landscapes with a rational land use system developed by farmers over many generations and farmers select and protect tree species to diversify production for subsistence and income as well as to minimize environmental risks related to climatic variability. The contribution to the conservation of biodiversity through in situ conservation of tree species on farm, reduction of pressure on remnant forests, and the provision of suitable habitat for a number of plants and animal species on farmlands. Besides, planted trees and shrubs contribute significantly to farmers’ livelihoods by supplying food, fodder, wood and medicine. The main challenges are poor survival rate of seedlings due to moisture stress and browsing, careless field clearing and weeding, and the presence of seedlings seemed to be determined mainly by moisture availability and seed availability. In conclusion parkland in West Africa covers wide part of the agricultural landscapes providing enormous services and products to the farming communities of the region. Then the best practices accumulated in West Africa have to be transfered to East Africa through linking the agroforestry expertes and the farmers of the two regions.

Although this tree holds high cultural significance for Dagomba women, it is unfortunately becoming scarcer in our study area near Tamale. We investigate the reasons for this decline in relation to the agricultural, ecological, and cultural landscape and discuss the gendered impacts of these changes. Research in these communities was conducted between 2018 and 2021 as part of a transdisciplinary action research approach to process underutilized species with women’s groups. The research started with a survey that included 27 women’s groups in 13 communities with 524 women participants. Out of a selected number of groups, our research team has worked more intensively with three women’s groups near Nyankpala, which selected for their processing focus the African Locust Bean, locally known as dawadawa. More than 45 group sessions were organized with seven groups in a collaborative learning process in 2019. Additionally, the three groups in Kpachi who chose to process the African Locust Bean sustained facilitation of group activities until the end of 2021. Specifically, on the topic of the decline of this tree, 19 semistructured interviews were conducted in August 2020 with 8 female farmers, 7 male farmers and 4 chiefs in the local governance system. Our results show the cultural significance of the African Locust Bean for women in the Dagomba culture as well as practical uses of all parts of the tree. Specifically, the seeds are used for making a fermented condiment and tea. Although seeds of the African Locust Bean are considered a women’s crop, their access to this tree is mediated by the local chiefs and often male land-users. Most farmers interviewed reported a reduction in trees in their fields. The reasons for the decrease can be summarized in six different categories, (1) aging tree populations, (2) challenge caring for saplings until maturity, (3) agricultural changes with increased mechanization and pesticide use, (4) over-use as a firewood resource, (5) usufruct rights between traditional chiefs, male land-owners, and women who should be granted access to the trees according to Dagomba cultural values, and (6) reduced water availability inhibits seed yield. In conclusion, there is an urgent need for action to protect and restore the African Locust Bean within northern Ghana’s savannah landscape to ensure continued access and benefits of the tree to women in the region.","The rainforests are the great green heart of Africa, and present a unique combination of ecological, climatic and human interactions. In this synthesis paper, we review the past and present state processes of change in African rainforests, and explore the challenges and opportunities for maintaining a viable future for these biomes. We draw in particular on the insights and new analyses emerging from the Theme Issue on ‘African rainforests: past, present and future’ of Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B. A combination of features characterize the African rainforest biome, including a history of climate variation; forest expansion and retreat; a long history of human interaction with the biome; a relatively low plant species diversity but large tree biomass; a historically exceptionally high animal biomass that is now being severely hunted down; the dominance of selective logging; small-scale farming and bushmeat hunting as the major forms of direct human pressure; and, in Central Africa, the particular context of mineral- and oil-driven economies that have resulted in unusually low rates of deforestation and agricultural activity. We conclude by discussing how this combination of factors influences the prospects for African forests in the twenty-first century.","Though agriculture has been linked to the decline in bird populations due to the associated changes in vegetation structure and composition, its potential to sustain birds has been explored over time. A sustainable agricultural landscape should be one that has the capacity to support bird species all year. To this end, we investigated the factors influencing pre‐ and post‐harvest farm conditions on bird abundance, richness, and feeding guilds in three different crop fields in Jos‐East and North, central Nigeria. We used line transects to survey birds and vegetation variables from 30 fields each of legumes, maize, and mixed (maize and soya bean) during the pre‐ and post‐harvest periods in central Nigeria. We modeled the effects of field conditions and vegetation parameters on bird species richness and encounter rates at overall and feeding‐guild levels. Our results showed that bird species richness was significantly higher pre‐harvest than post‐harvest. Bird encounter rate and feeding guild encounter rate were not affected by pre‐ and post‐harvest conditions. Bird species richness, encounter rate, and guild encounter rate were significantly higher in legume and mixed crop fields than in maize fields. In addition, in‐field tree density had a significant positive influence on bird and guild encounter rates, and species richness. Bird encounter rate and richness were significantly higher when the nearest non‐crop vegetation was either a gallery forest or rocky outcrop. A similar trend was observed for both insectivore and granivore encounter rates. Bird encounter rate declined with increasing distance from water sources and non‐crop vegetation. This study shows that pre‐ and post‐harvest conditions of crop fields can moderate the number and richness of birds on farmlands while the retention of trees on farmlands contributes to higher bird assemblages.","The diversity and structure of plant communities are valuable indicators for assessing landscape quality. Land-use change is one of the main factors considered to affect and have the strongest impacts on biodiversity. In this study, we assessed the effects of the conversion of tropical dry forests and savannahs into agricultural lands on the floral diversity and the structure of the vegetation. For this purpose, we carried out vegetation surveys in 198 plots of 50 m x 50 m. Within each plot, we documented all herbaceous, shrubby, and tree species present. We calculated total, spatial, and local floral diversities by land-use types and characterized the structure of the plant communities. Our results show that the overall floral diversity of the study area remains quite high (483 species of vascular plants from 298 genera and 71 families) and was not strongly impacted by agricultural land use (Pareto inequality index is 23-77). Croplands had the highest spatial (9.4) and local diversities. There was no significant difference between the land-use types in terms of the native species richness while croplands harbored significantly the most alien species. Agricultural land use significantly affected the structure of the plant communities. Trees are very rare in croplands and are frequent in forests and savannahs. The clearing of Guinean dry forests and savannahs for cropping did not automatically lead to a loss of some aspects of ordinary floral diversity. For a better understanding of the effects of land-use change on biodiversity, it would then be more suitable to specify in the studies whether the species concerned are native, alien, generalist, or specialist.","In the tropical zone, cocoa-based agroforest systems (CAFS) are considered as a mean to maintain and conserve biodiversiy. In the sub-humid zone of Togo (West Africa), agroforest plant species are key components of the landscape and agricultural lands. Cocoa and coffee agroforest systems contribute directly and indirectly to the livelihoods of an estimated one million people in Togo. Despite this fact, there is only few informations regarding their structure, and typology. The current study assessed the typology, tree structure and diversity of cocoa-based agroforest systems. 213 random plots across the study area were sampled using variable areas (25 × 25 m2, 50 × 50 m2 and 100 × 100 m2) for the survey. 4766 non-cocoa trees belonging to 195 plant species, 140 genera and 47 families were identified. Only woody trees were recorded during this study. The estimated average tree density was 159.21 ± 97.58 trees/ha, whereas the basal area was 54.19 m²/ha. Based on the Importance Value Index (IVI), the floristic composition, and the frequency of species, six groups (from G1 to G6) were discriminated. Each group was a particular type of CAFS. These results are similar to those obtained in the CAFS of West, Central Africa and other tropical zones, confirming CAFS key role in forest trees diversity conservation.   Key words: Cocoa-based agroforest system, typology, sub-humid, forest tree diversity, Togo.","Mountain landscape, described as a global biodiversity hotspot due to high endemism, is threatened by land-use change, including management and modification of vegetation. However, there is little knowledge about how road and land use affect plant diversity in mountains landscapes, particularly in southern Africa. Previous studies have studied the impact of the road or land use on plant species diversity separately and have concentrated on a single plant species. Here we compare the plant diversity of regenerated trees, shrubs, herbaceous plant, and grasses among Forest, Fallow, Agriculture, and Road in the Moribane Forest Reserve (MFR), in Eastern Chimanimani Mountain landscape in Mozambique. To assess how land-use change affects plant diversity, we conducted 45 transects along the roadside and randomly established 24 quadrats in the Agriculture fields and Fallow and 26 quadrats in the pristine Forest. In each transect and quadrats, we recorded the occurrence of four plant life forms (regenerated trees, shrubs, herbaceous, and grass species) to determine the alpha and beta-diversity across land-uses, and we assessed the invasiveness of each species. Species composition varied significantly among the land-uses types. Roadside had higher species diversity and the highest number of invasive species (138 total species of all plant life forms; 31 invasive species), following Agriculture (72; 30), Fallow (81; 20), and Forest (78; 19). There was no similarity in species between roadsides and other land-uses. Furthermore, roadside recorded the highest average species turnover for all plant life forms following Agriculture, Forest, and Fallow. Among the plants, the most important life form was herbaceous with 143 species, following grass with 86 species, shrubs with 86, and regenerated trees with 65 species. The land-use pattern makes the landscape more diversified in the study area and, as a result, increase the plant species richness and diversity by species replacement. This study is unique in collecting and analyzing data on different plant life forms on roadsides linked with a range of different land-use types within a small region of a mountain landscape in southern Africa.","Agroforestry practices are major features of the land-use systems in the dry lands of Eastern and Central Africa. Trees are used for a variety of purposes in both cropped lands and in livestock grazing systems. Trees in the land and homestead find various domestic and commercial applications for both wood and non-wood products.1 The multipurpose trees are purposefully selected and maintained when conversion of woodland to farmland for various benefits.2,3The woody species in Parkland agroforestry farming (PAF) favors the survival of native forest plants. Dispersed trees grown in farmlands characterize a large part of the Ethiopian agricultural landscape. Trees would be grown in a scattered form over a crop field, usually between 1–20 trees per hectare to minimize the impact on the companion crop.4","The East African drylands cover about 47% of the land surface and host about 20 million people. Rural people living in the drylands are mainly pastoralists who depend on livestock for both economic and social well-being. During the dry season, pastoralists apply strategic mobility to access grazing resources efficiently. However, this strategy has experienced change and constraints due to various demographic- and climate-related challenges. Pastoral lands have been cleared for large-scale agriculture while pastoralists have shifted towards agro-pastoralism. This has eroded many dryland trees and forests leading to environmental degradation. This review discusses important indigenous trees that can be utilized in ecological restoration of drylands as well as providing ecosystem goods and services. These include trees for gums and resins (Acacia, Commiphora and Boswellia), indigenous fruit trees (IFTs) (Adansonia digitata, Tamarindus indica and Balanites aegyptiaca), trees for wood (Melia volkensii and Terminalia brownie) and fodder (Acacia tortilis and Faidherbia albida). They are not only drought-tolerant but also have minimal disruption to the ecosystem. Various dryland restoration strategies and constraints are also discussed. For successful establishment, seedling planting should be integrated with other appropriate practices such as natural regeneration, silviculture and enrichment planting for sustainable dryland management.  Key words: Ecological restoration, drylands, indigenous trees, pastoralism.","Background and aims – Bitter and sweet African bush mango trees belong to the family Irvingiaceae and produce valuable non-timber forest products in humid lowland areas of West and Central Africa. The bitter and sweet types are treated as distinct taxa at the variety or species level. They have not been studied in the western part of their distribution range, and many aspects of their large-scale utilization remain unknown. In this study, we link differences in socio-cultural groups to the agroforestry status of bush mango trees in order to identify the key factors influencing their abundance and conservation in the study area. Methods – First, we gathered uses and local management strategies from nine main socio-cultural areas in Benin and Togo, part of the Dahomey Gap. Second, occurrence data were obtained throughout the Gap and imported into DIVA-GIS and MATLAB to calculate the spatial pattern of the density and analyse its structure and variation relative to three factors: the country, the phytogeographical zone and the dominant soil category. Third, agroforestry system characteristics and farmers' social status relative to 841 trees were used in a multinomial logistic regression to identify anthropogenic factors driving the intensive cultivation of bush mango trees. Finally, the impact of socio-cultural activities on extent and density of bush mango tree populations was analysed. Key results – In the entire study zone, the sweet mesocarp is consumed and the endocarp of bush mangoes is commercialized. The application of endocarp-based diets and socio-therapeutic uses are common to communities in Benin. Sweet bush mango trees are generally found either in home gardens or cultivation fields where they may occur at high densities (up to 1020 trees per 25 ha). Bitter trees, however, are confined to the Volta forest region in Togo and occur at low densities (<462 trees per 25 ha) in the wild, sometimes in protected areas, in forest gardens and in fields. This indicates a clear difference in cultivation methods between the bitter and sweet trees. Farmland status, farmer socio-cultural group and type of bush mango trees determined the cultivation intensity. Conclusion – The fact that small farmlands are converted into sweet bush mango tree orchards indicates that farmers actively cultivate bush mango trees in the study area. Diversity of indigenous knowledge, however, is not correlated either to intensive cultivation or domestication efforts and local genetic conservation program. Where slash and burn agriculture and intensive collection of fruits jeopardize bitter trees, traditional fishing systems (using bush mango twigs), a traditional selection strategy, and intensive land commercialization severely threaten sweet bush mango tree genetic resources.",18.8368687112022,0,"human, landscap, crop"

We formally characterise and name this species as Deinbollia onanae (Sapindaceae-Litchi clade) and we discuss it in the context of the assemblage of montane tree species in the Cameroon Highlands of West-Central Africa. The new species is a shade-bearing, non-pioneer understorey forest tree species reaching 15 m high and a trunk diameter that can attain over 40 cm at 1.3 m above the ground. Seed dispersal has been recorded by chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes ellioti) and by putty-nose monkeys (Cercopithecus nictitans) and the species is used by chimpanzees for nesting. Cameroon has the highest species-diversity and species endemism known in this African-Western Indian Ocean genus of 42, mainly lowland species. Deinbollia onanae is an infrequent tree species known from six locations in surviving islands of montane (sometimes also upper submontane) forest along the line of the Cameroon Highlands, including one at Ngel Nyaki in Mambilla, Nigeria. Deinbollia onanae is here assessed as Endangered according to the IUCN 2012 standard, threatened by severe fragmentation of its mountain forest habitat due to extensive and ongoing clearance for agriculture. The majority of the 28 tree species of montane forest (above 2000 m alt.) in the Cameroon Highlands are also widespread in East African mountains (i.e. are Afromontane wide). Deinbollia onanae is one of only seven species known to be endemic (globally restricted to) these highlands. It is postulated that this new species is morphologically closest to Deinbollia oreophila, a frequent species at a lower (submontane) altitudinal band of the same range. Detailed ecological data on Deinbollia onanae from the Nigerian location, Ngel Nyaki, where it has been known under the name Deinbollia “pinnata”, is reviewed.","Tropical forests are major repositories of biodiversity, but are fast disappearing as land is converted to agriculture. Decision-makers need to know which of the remaining forests to prioritize for conservation, but the only spatial information on forest biodiversity has, until recently, come from a sparse network of ground-based plots. Here we explore whether airborne hyperspectral imagery can be used to predict the alpha diversity of upper canopy trees in a West African forest. The abundance of tree species were collected from 64 plots (each 1250 m2 in size) within a Sierra Leonean national park, and Shannon-Wiener biodiversity indices were calculated. An airborne spectrometer measured reflectances of 186 bands in the visible and near-infrared spectral range at 1 m2 resolution. The standard deviations of these reflectance values and their first-order derivatives were calculated for each plot from the c. 1250 pixels of hyperspectral information within them. Shannon-Wiener indices were then predicted from these plot-based reflectance statistics using a machine-learning algorithm (Random Forest). The regression model fitted the data well (pseudo-R2 = 84.9%), and we show that standard deviations of green-band reflectances and infra-red region derivatives had the strongest explanatory powers. Our work shows that airborne hyperspectral sensing can be very effective at mapping canopy tree diversity, because its high spatial resolution allows within-plot heterogeneity in reflectance to be characterized, making it an effective tool for monitoring forest biodiversity over large geographic scales.","Tropical forests are major repositories of biodiversity, but are fast disappearing as land is converted to agriculture.

Cameroon has the highest species-diversity and species endemism known in this African-Western Indian Ocean genus of 42 species. Deinbollia onanae is an infrequent tree species known from five locations in surviving islands of montane (or upper submontane) forest along the line of the Cameroon Highlands. It is here assessed as Endangered according to the IUCN 2012 standard, threatened mainly by clearance of forest for agriculture. The majority of tree species characteristic of montane forest (above 2000 m alt.) in the Cameroon Highlands are also widespread in East African mountains (i.e. are Afromontane). Deinbollia onanae is one of only a very small number of species that are endemic (globally restricted to) the mountain range. It is postulated that this new species is in a sister relationship with Deinbollia oreophila, which is a frequent species of a lower (submontane) altitudinal band of the same range. It is further postulated that seed dispersal is or was by frugivorous birds, potentially turacos, alternatively by primates such as Preuss s monkey.","Abstract Weekly Prostephanus truncatus (Horn) flight activity, measured as the density of captured beetles in pheromone baited traps, was monitored for 76 consecutive weeks at 16 sites inside the Lama forest in southern Benin and at four sites in maize farmland just outside the forest. Prostephanus truncatus flight activity was consistently higher and the flight activity pattern significantly different near maize stores than at sites inside the forest. Although P. truncatus is known to infest girdled branches of Lannea nigritana (Sc. Elliot) Keay, the P. truncatus flight activity was comparatively low at forest sites where this tree species dominated. The main peak in P. truncatus flight activity occurred earlier in the eastern part of the forest compared with other forest parts. Ordination analysis showed that comparatively higher flight activity in the eastern part of the forest was positively associated with the presence of teak plantations (Tectona grandis L. F.) at trap sites. The spatial distribution of weekly P. truncatus trap catches were found to be significantly aggregated during a 21-wk period, which largely coincided with the early increase in P. truncatus flight activity in the eastern part of the forest. Based on this evidence, it was suggested that P. truncatus individuals disperse from the eastern part of the forest to other forest parts and to nearby agricultural areas, rather than, as has been previously suggested, from maize stores to the forest environment.","We revise and update the records of strict and near-endemic species of the Bali Ngemba Forest Reserve, the largest known surviving patch (c. 8 km2 in area) of submontane or cloud forest in the Bamenda Highlands, Cameroon which have lost >96 % of their original forest due to human activities. Nine strict endemics, and 11 near endemics are now documented, a drop from the number recorded after the first survey in 2004, since when five of the provisionally named species have been formally published. We test the hypothesis that a further one of the provisionally named putative Bali Ngemba new species, Vepris sp. A, an 8 – 20 m tall tree from cloud forest in the 1310 – 1600 m altitudinal band, is indeed new to science. We compare it morphologically with other multicarpellate, apocarpous, trifoliolate Cameroon tree species formerly placed in the genus Oricia Pierre until they were subsumed into Vepris by Mziray (1992). These are Vepris trifoliolata (Engl.) Mziray and V. gabonensis (Pierre) Mziray. We conclude that Vepris sp. A is a new undescribed species here named as Vepris onanae. The new species is illustrated, mapped and its conservation status assessed as Endangered using the 2012 IUCN standard due to the threats of habitat clearance from agricultural pressures at its three locations all of which remain formally unprotected. Vepris onanae appears unique among the Guineo-Congolian African oricioid species of Vepris in occurring in cloud forest, the other species, apart from V. renierii of the Albertine Rift, occurring in lowland forest. It also differs in the very broad, (7.8 –) 11.3 – 18 cm wide leaflets of the flowering stems which have a 6-18(−30) mm long, narrowly triangular acumen (vs leaflets <12 cm wide, acumen absent or short) and in having both subsessile and pedicellate (pedicels 0.25 – 0.3 mm long and 1(– 2) mm long) male flowers (vs male flower pedicels all sessile, or all c. 3 mm long). We report for the first time on stage-dependent leaf heteromorphy in Vepris and characterise a level of sexual dimorphism more advanced than usual in the genus. We highlight the importance of protecting Bali Ngemba and other forest patches in the Bamenda Highlands if species such as Vepris onanae are not soon to become extinct.","Monanthotaxis bali is the only known, solely montane (occurring solely above 2000 m alt.) species of the genus. It joins Monanthotaxis orophila (Rwanda) and M. discolor (Tanzania), two other species that can also occur above 2000 m alt. Monanthotaxis bali is an addition to the small number (28) of the tree species of the surviving montane forests of the Cameroon Highlands of which only eight other species are endemic. Due to its supra-axillary inflorescences, and petals arranged in one whorl but with the outer petals overlapping the inner petals distally, and rounded flower buds, the new species is placed in Hoekstra’s clade B of Monanthotaxis. The new species is unusual in being a treelet in a predominantly lianescent genus, and in lacking the glaucous underside of the leaf-blades that usually characterises the genus. Monanthotaxis bali takes the number of continental African species of the genus to 80, and makes Cameroon, with 30 species, the most species-diverse country for the genus. Monanthotaxis bali is known only from the Bali Ngemba Forest Reserve, a forest remnant under pressure of degradation and clearance in the Bamenda Highlands of Cameroon. It may already be extinct due to logging and agricultural activities. Here it is described, illustrated, mapped and assessed as Critically Endangered (Possibly Extinct) using the IUCN 2012 criteria.","The African tulip tree, Spathodea campanulata, dominates many post-agricultural secondary forests in the moist tropics. Some consider these novel forests have no ecological value, yet they appear to restore ecosystem processes on degraded sites. This study describes the litterfall mass and seasonality, canopy phenology, and microclimate of S. campanulata forests on alluvial and karst substrates in northern Puerto Rico. These substrates have different water drainage properties and I hypothesized that (1) annual leaf fall mass and seasonality would differ between substrate types; because (2) leaf fall would be related to water availability and seasonality. I used analysis of variance to compare annual and biweekly litterfall mass across three sites on each substrate type, and multiple linear regression analysis to relate biweekly litterfall to environmental variables. Litterfall mass was high (13.8 Mg·ha−1·yr−1, n = 6, SE = 0.60) yet its components did not differ by substrate type except for reproductive part mass which was higher on karst due to more S. campanulata flowers. Leaf fall had a bimodal seasonality and was negatively related to the number of dry days indicating it occurs when water is readily available or in excess as during floods. Observations show systematic leaf senescence in this deciduous species can be caused by water and nutrient demand from flowering. Litterfall mass and seasonality of novel S. campanulata forests is similar to that of native forests in Puerto Rico, yet flower fall appears to be higher than that of tropical forests worldwide. The environmental variables that affect litterfall seasonality and canopy phenology are similar to those in tropical forests in Puerto Rico and elsewhere. Litterfall seasonality and canopy phenology regulate understory microclimate, and influence the establishment and growth of juvenile trees and other organisms within S. campanulata forests. This study illustrates how forest ecosystem processes and properties restored by novel S. campanulata forests facilitate tree species establishment, growth, and turnover in deforested, abandoned, and degraded agricultural lands in Puerto Rico.","Abstract: Vepris bali is the first known species of Vepris in WC Africa with opposite, trifoliolate leaves and is further unusual for its long petiolules. Known only from Bali Ngemba Forest Reserve, a remnant of submontane forest under great pressure of degradation in the Bamenda Highlands of Cameroon, it may already be extinct due to tree cutting and agricultural incursions. Here, V. bali is compared with other endemic cloud forest Vepris of the Cameroon Highlands and is described, illustrated, mapped and assessed as Critically Endangered (Possibly Extinct) using IUCN 2012 criteria.

The forest-dwelling butterfly Charaxes xiphares occidentalis is naturally confined to a small forest region in the south-western Cape, South Africa. Most of the remaining habitat of this species is within a fragmented agricultural matrix. Furthermore, this geographical area is also heavily invaded by alien plants, especially Acacia mearnsii . We investigated how C. x. occidentalis behaviourally responds to different habitat conditions in the landscape. We were particularly interested in touring, patrolling and settling behaviour as a conservation proxy for preference of a certain habitat configuration in this agricultural matrix. Remnant forest patches in the agricultural matrix showed fewer behavioural incidents than in a reference protected area. Moreover, dense stands of A. mearnsii negatively influenced the incidence and settling pattern of this butterfly across the landscape, with fewer tree settlings associated with more heavily invaded forest patches. This settling pattern was predominantly seen in female butterflies. We also identified specific trees that were settled upon for longer periods by C. x. occidentalis . Distance to a neighbouring patch and patch size influenced behavioural incidences, suggesting that further patch degradation and isolation could be detrimental to this butterfly. Conservation implications: We highlight the importance of clearing invasive tree species from vulnerable forest ecosystems and identify key tree species to consider in habitat conservation and rehabilitation programmes for this butterfly. We also suggest retaining as much intact natural forest as possible. This information should be integrated in local biodiversity management plans.",26.6308411734573,4,"water, tropic, protect"

The historical indigenous land use of the Mara and wider Mau basin was wildlife conservation and pastoralism with highland agriculture. However, land policy changes, the rise of community conservancies and the increase in human populations have mediated unprecedented land use shifts over time. We analyze land use and land cover change (LULCC) trends from 1990 to 2040 in the Mara and the wider Mau River Basin landscape. The study examines land use and land cover change trends, establishes factors driving the trends, and assesses the implications of these trends on biodiversity. Multi-temporal satellite images, together with physical and social economic data, were collated to generate future scenarios for transitions for forest, shrubland, grassland, cropland, wetlands and built-up areas between 1990 and 2040. Agricultural expansion is the chief driver of LULCC in the Mara and the wider Mau River Basin, particularly since 2015. There was insignificant change to the forest cover after 2015, which was in part due to government intervention on forest encroachment and boundaries. The anthropogenic choice of tilling the land in the basin caused a decline in grasslands, forests and expanded shrublands, particularly where there was clear tree cutting in the Mau forest. Land use and land cover trends have generated undesirable impacts on ecosystem services that support wildlife conservation.","Agroforestry is one of the most conspicuous land use systems across landscapes and agro ecological zones in Africa. Some of the components of Agroforestry systems are; home garden agroforestry, alley cropping, forest farming, wind break, river banks, park land, crop land trees and buffer zones agroforestry practices. Climate change impacts by complex weather-related phenomena have threatened agricultural and forest ecosystems and the livelihood of agricultural and local communities. Agroforestry has an important role in climate change adaptation through diversified land-use practices, sustainable livelihoods, sources of income, enhanced forest and agricultural productivity and reduced weather-related production losses, which enhance resilience against climate impacts. Like few other land use options, agroforestry has real potential to contribute to food security, climate change mitigation and adaptation, while preserving and strengthening the environmental resource base of Africa’s rural landscapes. It has a key role to play in landscape-scale mitigation schemes under the REDD+or AFOLU (Agriculture, Forestry and other land uses) concepts. Home garden agroforestry system indicates that adaptation and mitigation to climate change will largely depend on the increased resilience of both agroforestry systems and of local management capacity. Despite less attention has been given to tree based land use option, agroforestry has played a major role in reducing household vulnerability to shocking. Smallholder farmers have already started mainstreaming tree based land use system as resilience to social needs because the poor are more exposed to change; Agroforestry is one of best risk aversion option to make them move out of food insecurity. Generally, agroforestry systems readily bundle both mitigation and adaptation strategies and provide several pathways to securing food security for poor farmers, while contributing to climate change mitigation. Agroforestry should attract more attention in global agendas on climate adaptation and mitigation because of its positive social and environmental impacts.","This paper examined the dynamics of land use changes on the livelihood of the local communities in Baringo County. Land is a principal factor of production, a source of life and livelihoods. It provides a means of living and a variety of uses such as agricultural, human settlement, environmental conservation, urban and industrial development purposes among others. These uses compete for space in a fixed area, hence the rising land use conflicts and degradation. The situation has threatened lives and livelihoods, making it difficult to plan for the livelihood activities in the County. This is happening against the backdrop of land use policy changes including; sessional paper no 3 of 2009 on the National Land Policy, the Constitution of Kenya 2010, the Land Act, 2012, the Land Registration Act, 2012, the Community Land Act, 2016 and sessional paper no 1 of 2017 on National Land Use Policy that were intended to alleviate the situation. This situation is now a major threat to the livelihood of the local communities in Baringo County. This study, therefore, sought to examined the dynamics of land use changes on the livelihood of the local communities in Baringo county with specific objective to establish the drivers of the changes. A comprehensive desk review of existing literature was done, and land use changes were descriptively analyzed. The review spanned from pre-colonial (before 1895), colonial (1895 to 1963), independence (1963 to 2010) including the subsequent years of land reforms following the promulgation of the Constitution of Kenya 2010 onwards to 2020. The study found that the key drivers of land use changes originate from the change of land use policies from customary to European-like systems during the colonial era (1895 to 1963). These drivers revolve around the conflicts in the application of land use policies and laws, dual production system (different land use for registered private land in arable areas and the unregistered community land in non-arable areas within the county) occasioning wide productivity gap and economic disparity.

The consequences disorganize the local community land use and social system, broke down the traditional grazing and cropping patterns, depleted soils fertility & degraded the environment. In addition, the study found out that in the unregistered community land, land use conflicts were rampant, and characterized by invaded and claim interest as well as unscrupulous legal manipulation of land ownership records leading to dispossession. These two salient features are the main drivers of land use changes that led to continuous and frequent fatal inter-ethnic land use conflicts among the local communities; causing displacement and destruction of property among other atrocities working against politically weak local community. This scenario destabilized livelihood possibilities making it difficult for local communities to engage in basic livelihood activities and create uncertainty for future development. The study concluded that the security of land tenure perpetrates land use conflicts particularly in the unregistered community land. The government, therefore, need to register the community land to enhance land tenure security in the county. Background of the Study The background of the study covers introduction, problem statement, objectives Introduction Globally, land resource is the basis of human livelihood, since it provides basic needs such as food, water, energy, clothing and shelter. It allows for a variety of uses including agricultural production, human settlement and environmental conservation to preserve it for posterity, and can satisfy a diverse range of local communities’ livelihood objectives. All these uses of land resource compete for space in a fixed land area within an ever-changing environment. In addition, it is a finite resource and increasingly becoming scarce over time. The ensuing competition and growing forces at work necessitates government intervention through land use policy in order to harmonize the various uses. Moreover, in practice, it is difficult to arrive to an equilibrium between the various uses without an external force. Therefore, the unfolding scenario leads to land use changes problems, which calls for government intervention through land use policies. Land use policy is intended to balance users demands, facilitate production and sustain livelihood for the local communities and at same time guarantee political stability. In this study, dynamics of land use changes is defined as policy changes and the resultant consequences. In Africa, dynamics of land use changes evolved through various transformations associated with government policies adopted by different political regimes. The changes were traced from the precolonial, colonial and post-colonial eras. Each of these eras introduced changes in land use policies that shape up different social, economic and political realities on the livelihood of the local communities. Livelihood is defined as comprising the capabilities, assets (including both material and social resources) and activities required for a means of living by the local communities (Scones, 2008). Livelihood is sustainable when it can cope with the policy changes, and recover from, stresses and shocks arising from it, maintain or enhance local communities’ capabilities, assets and activities, while not undermining the natural resources base. In this case, land resource represents the natural resource base, and the capacity of the local communities to use it to generate and maintain their means of living, enhance their well-being and preserve it for future generations is dependent on policy changes. These changes influence greatly the livelihood outcomes of the local communities. International Journal of Academic Research in Business and Social Sciences Vol. 1 1 , No. 9, 2021, E-ISSN: 2222-6990 © 2021 HRMARS 563 In this respect, local communities are indigenous populations who reside and derive their livelihood from land resource. They consider land resource as the principal factor of production and the source of livelihood because it provides basic needs such as food, water, energy, clothing and shelter. Land resource also allows for a variety of uses including agricultural, human settlement and environmental conservation that satisfy a diverse range of livelihood objectives for local communities. In Kenya, dynamics of land use changes emanates largely from colonial regime actions and policies, which continued in slightly modified manner after independence (Thuo, 2013). Before the colonial era (before 1895), land use was managed through African local communities’ customary laws. Land use and management practices were guided and controlled by established regulations and procedures among various local communities (Thuo, 2013). Land use was organized into specific areas of agricultural (crops and livestock), human settlement, environmental conservation uses and heritage sites, among others. Most of the land resource was owned by the entire community while individual community members had only user rights (Thuo, 2013). The land use was communal, small-scale subsistence in nature, stable and sustainable in terms of provision for local communities’ livelihood and environmental conservation needs. The period depicts a close economy without government intervention in terms of land use policy changes. Local communities enjoy territorial niches with boundaries defined by specific geographical and physical features such as rivers, mountains, trees, and valleys. The ethnic community chiefs, assisted by the Council of elders, had the power to make land use decisions. Land use was assumed to operate in a dynamic equilibrium checked by raids and natural disasters such as war, disease outbreaks, earthquakes and famines. Soil fertility was maintained through shift cultivation with adequate fallow periods of three (3) years or more required to restore soil structure and fertility. Much of the uncultivated land was used as pastoral communities grazing areas. Forested areas were used for hunting, trapping and honey gathering. Periodic droughts checked Land use and inter communities’ raids to maintain the dynamic equilibrium. During colonial era(1895 to 1963), the colonial government took over the control of land use from the local communities through violence, trickery, and mutual agreements (Thuo, 2013). It dismantled the ethnic community territorial niches and nationalized land use. All land in Kenya became Crown Land. All local communities were dispossessed, and customary land use laws by the local communities were rendered redundant. All existing land use rights by the local communities were at the mercy of the colonial power (Okoth-Ogendo, 1995). Therefore, the genesis of land use problems in Kenya. Fundamentally, the land use policy changes were biased and oriented to benefit European settlers with scant attention to local communities. The land use policies created a dual land use system where the European colonists occupy the high rainfall and fertile areas, employing modern land use practices based on individuals’ decisions. At the same time, the local communities were restricted to native reserves in the drier regions, where local communities were allowed to continue with collective land use decisions. These land use changes promoted economic disparity between European settler and local communities during colonial era. Land use policies promoted high productivity land use practices for European white farmers, while encouraging low productivity traditional land use practices for local communities. The land use policy c","ABSTRACT Land systems are described based on various characteristics, including land cover composition and agricultural production. However, it is uncertain to what extent livestock, particularly monogastric livestock, determines land systems. We included monogastrics in a land system classification, and statistically analyzed the land cover composition and agricultural production of otherwise similar land systems with and without monogastric livestock. The results indicate that land systems with monogastrics are statistically different from their counterparts in the classification without monogastrics in terms of grassland area and crop yields, but are less different in terms of tree area, crop area, and ruminant livestock production. We then used a land systems map that includes monogastrics in the classification and a similar map that does not include monogastrics to project future changes in a novel manner that integrates livestock as a determinant of land systems. The results show that including monogastrics in otherwise similar projections yields less cropland intensification and more cropland expansion in several world regions, including Northern Africa and the Middle East. Other regions, such as Europe and Australia, were characterized by less decrease or more increase in tree area in the application with monogastrics, mainly due to the occurrence of open forests with monogastrics. This study prompts a call for improved characterization of land systems for land use and cover change (LUCC) assessments in order to better represent LUCC driven by monogastric livestock.","A relação entre água, energia e alimento é um tema que tem recebido atenção no meio acadêmico. Diante da escassez dos recursos naturais, da degradação que tem ocorrido não somente no Brasil, mas no mundo todo, os recursos naturais têm sérios riscos de esgotarem. E há que se pensar em uma gestão que possibilite a recuperação do meio ambiente de forma eficiente e sustentável. Compreendendo que o debate de nexo envolve um conjunto de inter-relações entre os recursos naturais utilizados como insumo para os serviços básicos da vida humana, neste sentido, a presente pesquisa objetivou analisar se há possibilidade de integrar a floresta ao nexo água-energia-alimentos, com vistas a não comprometer as demandas futuras e como isso pode contribuir para alcançar os Objetivos de Desenvolvimento Sustentável (ODS). Os objetivos específicos são identificar a interligação entre água, energia, alimento e floresta; apontar a necessidade de integrar a floresta ao nexo tradicional visando alcançar um desenvolvimento mais sustentável e controlar, prevenir as consequências dos impactos ambientais. A metodologia da revisão literária ocorreu com o levantamento por termos previamente identificados nas bases de dados Scopus, Web of Science e Periódico Capes, sendo a pesquisa classificada com abordagem qualitativa e método dedutivo. Os resultados apontaram que a floresta possui relação direta com os elementos água-energia-alimentos, sendo possível contribuir com as seguranças hídrica, energética e alimentar. Concluiu-se que vincular as florestas ao nexo existente, proporcionará uma maior preocupação para garantir a sustentabilidade e o equilíbrio ambiental.   Referências ALROY, John.

Relação entre a disponibilidade hídri","This study was conducted on an assessment of the various mitigation strategies to combat desertification in Jibia and Kaita Local Government Areas of Katsina State, Nigeria. The data use includes Satellite imageries for the study such as landsat MSS of 1976, landsat TM of 1987, SPOT XS of 1995 and landsat ETM of 2006 as well as structured questionnaires. Sixty close ended copies of the Questionnaire were administered in the study. Purposive sampling method of administering questionnaires was adopted. The percentages land mass covered for each of these variables was determined and estimated in M2. literature was obtained from various agencies which were responsible for desertification control in Katsina state. It was found from the reserved forest that in 1976 the percentage of reserved forest was 2.57%. In 1987 however, it increased by 73.9% to 76.47 %. By 1995, it declined by 9.42% to 67.05% and further declined by 0.52% in 2006. Effort to combat desertification through the use of reserved forest has been quite significant over the years. Also, noticed was a declined in shelter belt from 5.91% in 1987 to 1.097% in 1995 and a shot up to 7.39% in 2006. About 37% of the respondent opined that the deforestation leads to the disappearance of trees while 33% pinioned that it leads to reduction on agricultural productivity. The major strategy adopted to combat desertification is tree planting as supported by 88% of the respondents. It found that desertification as major environmental problem of the study area has reduced drastically from 43.34% in 1976 to 1.29% in 2006. It was also revealed from this study that some organizations such as European Economic Community/Katsina State government EEC/KTSG, Katsina Afforestation Project Unit KTAPU and Local Government Councils are the major agencies that are responsible for mitigating desertification in the study area.

Understanding LULCCs at the watershed level is essential for transboundary river basin management. The present study aims to analyse the past and future LULCCs in two significant watersheds of the Senegal River basin (SRB) in West Africa: Bafing and Faleme. This study used Landsat images from 1986, 2006 and 2020 and the Random Forest classification method to analyze past LULCCs in these two watersheds. The results revealed: In Bafing, vegetation, settlement, agricultural areas and water increased, while the bareground decreased significantly between 1986-2020. In Faleme, two periods have different trends. Between 1986-2006, vegetation, settlement, agricultural areas and water increased, while bareground decreased. Between 2006-2020, settlement increased, while vegetation, agricultural areas, water and bareground decreased. To predict LULCCs in 2050 under business-as-usual assumptions, the Multilayer Perceptron and Marcov Chain model (MLP-MC) was used. The MLP-MC shows better results on Bafing than on Faleme but without questioning its application on the two watersheds. Bafing has seen a trend towards ”more people, more trees”, while Faleme has seen a trend towards ”more people, more deforestation”. These results contribute to develop appropriate land management policies and strategies to achieve or to maintain sustainable development in the SRB.","Land use change is one of the most important determinants of carbon storage and dynamics in ecosystems. Areas in the proximity of metropoles undergo land use changes but are poorly studied for their soil and biomass carbon budget, especially in Africa. Close to Benin's economic capital, the Lama Territory located on the Allada Plateau and is subject to high demographic and urbanization pressures. Carbon (C) stocks in the region are likely to be rapidly changing. This research assessed the land use changes and quantified the spatial distribution and variation of C stocks between 2000 and 2018 on the Ferralsols of the study area. Random forest models using spectral bands of LANDSAT images and some spectral indices as predictors were calibrated to classify the land use. C stocks of four C pools (aboveground, belowground biomass, litter, and soil) were mapped with InVEST (integrated valuation of ecosystem services and tradeoffs) model. Land use change occurred in 61% of the Ferralsol area between 2000 and 2018. The surface of forests and crop‐plantation associations decreased in benefit of tree plantations, adult palm groves, and built‐up areas. With the loss of forest surface and the increasing urbanization, C stocks of the region decreased by −218 Gg C with 4% uncertainty (−175 Gg C in soil pools, and − 125 Gg C in aboveground biomass with both 6% uncertainty) between 2000 and 2018. Results highlight: (i) the need for soil C stock accounting to avoid underestimation of C stocks evolution in a rural region; and (ii) the relevance of tree plantations and deforestation control to maintain the C stocks in tropical areas.","Abstract Nazinga Game Ranch (NGR) is a reserve in Burkina Faso involving local communities for securing biodiversity through sustainable management. Yet, its ecosystems are threatened by increasing number of elephants and illegal human activities. Renowned as a model of wildlife participatory management, NGR has mainly been studied for its animal wildlife only. The aim of this study was to uncover ecological effects of recent land management on savanna habitats including tourism, and to conclude on more sustainable options, land use/land cover (LULC) changes and vegetation dynamics in NGR were analyzed. This was accomplished with multi-temporal change detection using Landsat images of 1984, 2002 and 2013 to map seven representative LULC classification categories, and quantitative indices of landscape metrics. The results showed that the LULC dynamics in NGR from 1984 to 2013 was mainly characterized by an expansion of gallery forest, tree savanna and agricultural area and a reduction of shrub savanna, woodland and bare soils. From 2002 to 2013, fragmentation in all land cover types increased at the landscape level, whereas at the class level, it decreased for woodland. Our findings provided evidence of habitat degradation in NGR, due to extensive agriculture, tourism and growing of elephants’ population. According to the original management goals and the purposes of the reserve, both fauna and tourism are to be maintained and sustained in a sustainable way. Adaptation of land use and targeted wildlife management are the main requirements for avoiding further degradation of vegetation and thus of the existence basis of local inhabitants, animals and tourism.","This study is focused on land use and land cover dynamics observed in Central River Region. It aims to determine the direction and rate of change in land use as a means of assessing the impact of climate change in Central River Region (CRR) of The Gambia. Decadal satellite images were used to measure changes in land use and land cover from 1984 to 2017 using supervised classification. Eight land use and land cover types were identified and mapped in this study namely: Crop lands, Gambia River, Halophytic vegetation, Irrigated crops, Mangrove, Settlement, Shrub/Wood savanna and Wooded savanna. The areas of crop lands, halophytic vegetation and settlement expanded between 1984 and 2017. River Gambia, irrigated crops, mangrove, shrub/wood savanna and wooded savanna areas decreased during the same period. Transition to less savanna was higher than transition to more settlement. In addition, physicochemical parameters were analyzed during the rainy and dry seasons for correlation with climate data. Socioeconomic surveys based on structured questionnaires were also conducted with 70 households in 6 villages in CRR. Land clearing for agriculture, tree cutting for firewood and charcoal, settlement and livestock grazing were mainly cited by the respondents as the main culprit inducing land cover change in CRR. This study shows that deforestation and forest degradation are still in progress despite the implementation of a management plan for a full rotation. We therefore proposed best management practices in order to control the agricultural clearing of land in the region such as agricultural intensification and soil fertility improvement.",18.2351799342271,1,"polici, manag, cover"

The tested SSR markers showed a high level of polymorphism. A total of 188 alleles were detected at the 22 loci ranging from three to 21 with an average of 8.54 alleles per locus. The average of heterozygosity for all cultivars was 0.503; genetic distance among cultivars varied from 0.171 to 0.938 indicating diverse relationships. The cultivar Ghanami Akhder was highly divergent from ‘Ghnami Ahmer’, whereas ‘Jamal Al-Dean’ was very closely related to ‘Qitaz’. Unweighted pair group method arithmetic average ordered date palm cultivars into two main clusters. Principal coordinate analysis exhibited the similar clusters of cultivars as in the dendrogram. Date palm (2n = 2x = 36) is considered of great socioeconomic importance in the Arabian region. The tree has been, and is still, at the center of comprehensive agricultural development. It is believed to have originated from Mesopotamia (Wrigley, 1995). The numbers of known date palm cultivars that are distributed all over the world are 5000 of which 600 are found in Iraq. Iraq is one of the largest date-producing countries in the world. Before 1991, Iraq was the largest producer of dates in the world (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, 2008) and had the largest date forest in the world (MacFarquhar, 2003). However, during the Gulf and Iran–Iraq wars, large numbers of date palm trees were destroyed. Wars and sanctions imposed on Iraq have negatively affected both the production and natural genetic diversity of the crop in Iraq and inhibited the much-needed impetus to rebuild the date palm industry. Development of suitable DNA molecular markers for this crop may allow researchers to estimate genetic diversity, which will ultimately lead to the genetic conservation of date palm. The success of particular genetic conservation or breeding programs is dependent on understanding the amount and distribution of the genetic variation already present in the genetic pool (Jubrael et al., 2005). Morphological traits have been used to describe such genetic variation in date palm cultivars (Barreveld, 1993), which are mainly related to the fruit and influenced by the environment (Askari and Al-Khalifah, 2003; Sedra et al., 1993, 1998). In addition, biochemical studies, including isozyme and activity analyses of peroxidases, have been used to characterize date palms in Morocco and Tunisia (Baaziz, 1988; Baaziz and Saaidi, 1988; Bendiab et al., 1998; Majourhat et al., 2002; Ould Salem Mohamed et al., 2001). As such, analysis does not reflect precisely that polymorphisms occurred (Al-Jibouri and Adham, 1990). DNA marker analysis in date palm is recently in the development stage. Askari and Al-Khalifah (2003) analyzed the genetic diversity among 13 different cultivars using random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) markers. Similar reports are published for North African cultivars (Hussein et al., 2002; Sedra et al., 1998). Amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) markers (Vos et al., 1995) were also been used for genetic fingerprinting and mapping for this crop. Jubrael et al., (2005) and Khierallah et al. (2011) used AFLP fingerprinting to characterize a number of Iraqi date palm cultivars. Microsatellites, also known as SSR, are ideal DNA markers for population studies and genetic mapping as a result of their abundance, high level of polymorphism, dispersion throughout diverse genomes, ease to assay by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and ease to disseminate among laboratories (Udupa and Baum, 2001). Microsatellite markers were used for investigation of genetic diversity in date palm (Billotte et al., 2004). Zehdi et al. (2004) applied these markers to characterize Tunisian cultivars, whereas Al-Ruqaishi et al. (2008) used these primers to screen and analyze the genetic diversity among clonal genotypes of Omani cultivars. Recently, many researchers in date palm-producing countries have used SSR markers to genotype cultivars. Elshibli and Korpelainen (2008) investigated genetic diversity in Sudan germplasm representing 37 female and 23 male accessions using 16 SSR primers. In Qatar, Ahmed and Al-Qaradawi (2009) used 10 primers to analyze genetic Received for publication 27 Jan. 2011. Accepted for publication 24 June 2011.

(2010) developed 1000 SSR markers in date palm, mining genome sequencing data for this vital crop. The aim of this study is intended to characterize the genotype for 30 Iraqi important date palm cultivars using SSR markers. Materials and Methods PLANT MATERIALS. Leaves were collected from 30 welldefined reference Iraqi date palm cultivars grown in date palm stations belong to the Ministry of Agriculture (Table 1). Twenty-two female cultivar samples were collected from AlMahaweel Date Palm Station, Hilla Governorate, 80 km south of Baghdad. The remaining eight cultivar samples were collected from Al-Za’afarania Date Palm Station, Baghdad (Fig. 1). Total genomic DNA was extracted from young and healthy leaves according to the procedure mentioned by Benito et al. (1993) with minor modifications. After purification, the resultant DNA was quantified on 1% agarose gel electrophoresis as described by Sambrook et al. (1989). MICROSATELLITE AMPLIFICATION. A total of 33 date palmspecific primer pairs were tested; 16 of them were developed by Billotte et al. (2004) and 17 were developed by Akkak et al. (2009) as indicated in Table 2. PCR was performed in a total mixture of 20 mL containing: 13.9 mL H2O, 50 ng of total cellular DNA (2 mL) as template, 1 mL/PCR buffer (Roche, Mannheim, Germany), 1 mL of 0.2 mM of dNTP PCR mix (Roche), 0.1 mL (0.625 U) of Taq DNA polymerase (Roche) and1 mL of 0.2 mM of each primer using forward primer end labeled (6FAM, NED, or TET). Amplifications were performed in a thermocycler (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA) under the following conditions: a denaturation step of 5 min at 95 C followed by 35 cycles of 30 s at 95 C, 1 min at 52 C and 1 min at 72 C, and a final extension step at 72 C for 7 min. At the testing stage, amplification products were separated by electrophoresis according to their molecular weight in 1.4% agarose gels and then detected by staining with ethidium bromide as described by Sambrook et al. (1989). The DNA profiles were visualized on an ultraviolet transilluminator and documented by using a gel documentation system (Alpha Innotech Imaging Station; Cell Biosciences, Santa Clara, CA). For final analyses, 2 mL of amplified DNA (diluted to 1/10) and 8 mL of (Rox) DNA standard size (Applied Biosystems) were loaded into 96-well plates. Genotyping was carried out using an automatic DNA analyzer (Model 3100; Applied Biosystems). Amplifications were performed at least twice and only reproducible products were taken into account for further data analysis. SIMPLE SEQUENCE REPEAT GENOTYPING. Electropherogram data were analyzed by using Foundation Data Collection software (Genetic Analyser Data Collection Version 2.0; Applied Biosystems). Allele size scoring was performed by Gene Mapper software (Version 3.7; Applied Biosystems). The Jaccard similarity matrix (Jaccard, 1908) was used for cluster analysis using the unweighted pair group method arithmetic average to study the genetic relationships among the cultivars. Jaccard similarity index, major allele frequency, heterozygosity, gene diversity, and polymorphism information content estimation were done using a software package (PowerMarker Version 1.31; Liu and Muse 2005). The phylogenetic diagram was drawn by PAST software [Version 1.91 (Hammer et al., 2001)] on the basis of Hamming similarity index with 100 bootstrap. Principal coordinate analysis (PCA) was performed according to Euclidean similarity index using the PAST software.","Root feeding bark beetles in the genus Hylastes Hylastes breeding in loblolly pine across 3 crown (Coleoptera: Curculionidae: Scolytinae) commoncondition classes (healthy, dying, dead).

E. guineensis, however, is the major economic species: fruits of E. oleifera have a much lower oil content and are used only locally (Westphal and Jansen, 1989). However, E. guineensis was introduced into South America during the time of the slave trade, and naturalized groves are reported in coastal areas of Brazil near Bélem. In the mid-1800s it was introduced to South-East Asia via the Botanic Gardens in Bogor, Indonesia. The first oil-palm estates in Sumatra (since 1911) and Malaysia (since 1917) used plant material from second- and third-generation descendants of the original Bogor palms, from which one of the breeding populations, the Deli Dura, is derived (Westphal and Jansen, 1989). After soyabean, E. guineensis is the second most important crop worldwide for the supply of edible vegetable oil. Palm oil kernel, for example, is a major agricultural export from Malaysia, and South-East Asia is the main area of production.E. guineensis yields two types of oil: palm oil from the fleshy mesocarp, and palm-kernel oil from the kernel, in a volume ratio 10:1. Most palm oil is used in food preparation (margarines, and industrial frying oils used to prepare snack foods, etc.). Palm-kernel oil is similar in composition and properties to coconut oil, and is used in confectionery, where its higher melting point is particularly useful. It is also used in the manufacture of lubricants, plastics, cosmetics and soaps. The oil palm is a monoecious, erect, single-stemmed tree usually 20-30 m high. The root system is shallow and adventitious, forming a dense mat in the top 35 cm of the soil. The main stem is cylindrical, up to 75 cm diameter. E. guineensis palm fronds are not as suitable for thatching as other palm species, as the leaflets attach to the rachis at two angles. The oil palm is indigenous to the lowland humid tropics, and thrives on a good moisture supply and relatively open conditions. It can tolerate fluctuating water-tables with periods of standing water, although continuously flooded conditions are unsuitable. Sites often selected as suitable for oil palm are swamps, riverbanks, or sites considered too moist for tropical rain forest trees. Rainfall is often the major factor limiting production in plantations: highest yields occur where rainfall is evenly distributed throughout the year, with an optimum of 150 mm per month (Westphal and Jansen, 1989). Oil palms can grow on a variety of soil types, from sandy soils to lateritic red and yellow podzols, young volcanic soils, alluvial clays and peat soils; water-holding capacity appears to be the most important soil criterion. It is a demanding crop in terms of soil nutrients. The oil palm also has potential for incorporation into agroforestry practices. Traditional oil palm management in some areas of West Africa often incorporated both pure oil palm groves (perhaps selectively retained), scattered oil palms within temporary fields, and unexploited oil palms in mixed forest (Gupta, 1993). Harvesting of fruits usually starts about 2½ years after field planting; bunches ripen throughout the year and so harvesting usually takes place at intervals of 2 to 3 weeks in any particular area. Because oil palm is so responsive to environmental conditions, yields may vary greatly. However, over the lifetime of a palm tree, yields generally rise to a maximum in the first 6-8 years (after field planting), and will subsequently decline slowly. In Malaysia and Sumatra, well-managed plantations yield between 24 and 32 tonnes/hectare of fruit bunches; the oil yield from this will be between 4.8 and 7 tonnes/hectare. Oil palm plantations are often regarded as a better use of the land than annual food crops in humid tropical areas where soils are prone to leaching: the plantations provide continuous ground cover, and the palm canopy helps protect against soil erosion. Oil palm stems are increasingly used as a raw material for paper and composite board production. This area has big prospects in wood-based industries. It is recommended that more research is undertaken into the properties and utilization. Propagation techniques, the management of pests and diseases, and genetic resources are other areas in which studies could usefully be undertaken.","Auger beetles (Coleoptera: Bostrichidae), also known as false powderpost beetles, are serious pests of trees, forest products, agricultural crops, and stored vegetable products in most regions of the world (Fisher 1950; Lawrence 2010). There are approximately 570 species in 89 genera worldwide (Lawrence 2010), including approximately 73 native species found in North America (Ivie 2002). Most woodboring bostrichids obtain nutrition from starch, enabling many species to utilize almost any dry wood material from an enormous host range (Ivie 2002). The frequency of non-native bostrichid interceptions at ports of entry and storage facilities around the world has increased during the last decade (Teixeira et al. 2002; Ratti 2004; Filho et al. 2006; Aukema et al. 2011; EPPO 2011; Price et al. 2011). Bostrichids, along with many other woodboring insects, are often accidentally introduced inside solid wood packing material in containerized cargo (Haack 2006). The bostrichid genus Sinoxylon Duftschmid contains 52 species, all of which are native to Asia, Africa, and Southern Europe (Borowski & Wegrzynowicz 2007) and are typically not considered primary pests. Sinoxylon species utilize a wide variety of hosts, including numerous trees, shrubs, herbaceous plants, and bamboos (Filho et al. 2006). Sinoxylon damage is typically caused by the boring of adults and larvae in the stems, branches, or twigs of dead, damaged, or stressed hosts (Nair 2007). One species has even been known to damage lead cables (Filho et al. 2006). Species of Sinoxylon are frequently intercepted in the U.S.A., representing 32% of bostrichid interceptions between 1985 and 2000 (Haack 2006; Price et al. 2011). There have been 289 Sinoxylon interceptions in the U.S.A. between 2007 and 2012 (Brian Saunders, USDA-APHIS-PPQ, Cape Canaveral, Florida, personal communication). In the continental U.S.A., there are 2 established non-native species of Sinoxylon. Sinoxylon anale Lesne and S. conigerum Gerstacker are both established in southern Florida (Peck & Thomas 1998). Another species, S. ceratoniae (L.), may be established in California (Ivie 2002). Sinoxylon anale Lesne is the most economically important and most commonly intercepted species of Sinoxylon, typically arriving in solid wood packing materials (Fisher 1950; Argaman 1987; Teixeira et al. 2002; Sittachaya et al. 2009; Beaver et al. 2011). Sinoxylon anale is native to the Indomalaya and Palearctic ecozones, where it attacks more than 70 species of plants. In the United States, Price et al. (2011) reported 2 interceptions of S. anale in Georgia in 2004 and 2010, both arriving from India in solid wood packing materials. Borowski and Wegrzynowicz (2007) list 3 other species, S. japonicum Lesne, S. sexdentatum (Olivier) (as S. muricatum (L.)), and S. ruficorne Fahaeus, as introduced into the United States, but these records are apparently based on the interceptions reported by Fisher (1950) that do not represent established populations. On 29 Aug 2011 in West Point, Mississippi, United States (N 33°36’25” W 88°39’01”), a substantial infestation of larval and adult Sinoxylon indicum Lesne (Fig. 1A) and S. sudanicum Lesne (Fig. 1B) was discovered in wooden crates and pallets that originated from Pakistan. It is not known if the wood used to construct the crates originated in Pakistan, or whether the wood was treated according to IPPC international standards","Seedling production nurseries have been receiving much attention because of increasing demand for seedlings. In sub-Saharan Africa studies have showed over 50% of smallholder seedlings planted were sourced in tree nurseries. This has caused a rise in need to improve quality of seedlings especially focused on production level. The focus on most studies on early growth performance of selected key species important either for commercial plantation or agroforestry has been varied on length of the study periods and measurement parameters, with the focus never being to compare the farmer practices with the industry. This study main objective is to determine the effect of growing media on early growth performance of Grevillea robusta and Cupressus lusitanica seedlings in the highlands of Kenya. These species from literature have shown abundance in terms of demand and availability in smallholder tree nurseries and received complaints on varied performance. The parameters under observation were height, branch numbers, leaf numbers and survival of the seedlings of these species over a six-month period. There were 13 treatments which included various soil mixtures as follows: Agricultural soil (A), Forest soil (FS), Farmyard Manure (FYM), and Sand (S) and their combinations. The study employed a Completely Randomized Design with total of 390 seedlings per species. The performance showed that the soil mixture with the combined mean cumulative highest survival was FS 78±3.2% and combined mean lowest cumulative survival was A+S+FYM (37±4.2%). Cupressus lusitanica performed better in survival (70±1.2%), height (171±8.1mm), branch numbers (25±1.1), and leaf numbers (119±12.1), when compared to Grevillea robusta survival (38±1.6%), height (57±4.0mm), branch numbers (2±0.2), and leaf numbers (13±1.1%) in the nursery. Different soil mixtures had performed differently for each of the parameters in the study with key observation was FS+FYM+S was the best performing for C. lusitanica height, branching, leaf numbers and survival. The study also observed FS was best performing for the survival of G. robusta in the nursery. This study demonstrates that seedlings in the nursery for these two species require different soil mixtures to ensure survival and high growth performance.","Four subsets of apple (Malus Mill.) germplasm representing modern and old cultivars from the repository and apple genetics population of the Horticulture and Food Research Institute of New Zealand Limited were used in this study. A total of 155 genotypes randomly chosen from the four subsets were analyzed for random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) variation. Nine decamer primers generated a total of 43 fragments, 42 of which were polymorphic across the 155 genotypes. Pairwise distances were calculated between germplasm subsets using the distance metric algorithm in S-PLUS, and used to examine intra-and inter-subset variance components by analysis of molecular variation (AMOVAR). A phenogram based on unweighted pair group method with arithmetic average (UPGMA) cluster analysis was constructed from the pairwise distances and a scatter plot was generated from principal coordinate analysis. The AMOVAR showed that most of the variation in the germplasm (94.6%) was found within subsets, suggesting that there is significant variation among the germplasm. The grouping of genotypes based on the phenogram and scatter plot generally did not reflect the pedigree or provenance of the genotypes. It is possible that more RAPD markers are needed for determining genetic relationships in apple germplasm. Nevertheless, the variation observed in the study suggests that the current practice of sublining populations in the first generation to control inbreeding may not be necessary in subsequent generations. If these results are confirmed by fully informative molecular markers, germplasm managers should reassess the structure of their genetics populations. There may be a need to combine sublines in order to capture the maximum genetic diversity available and to streamline breeding efforts. genetic resources in germplasm collections and successive stages of development in breeding programs. More specifically, knowledge of genetic diversity and relationships among sets of germplasm and the potential merit of the genetic diversity is critical to plant improvement (Lee, 1995). In 1990, the Horticulture and Food Research Institute of New Zealand Limited (HortResearch), established a population improvement program to broaden the genetic base and, at the same time study the genetics of horticulturally important traits in apples. An apple genetics population was developed from imported seed and pollen from apple cultivars and varieties from clonal repositories in major apple producing regions in Europe, North America, Australia, Asia and South Africa (Noiton and Shelbourne, 1992). Seeds of accessions of Malus sieversii (Lebed.) were also obtained from Kazakhstan—the presumed center of origin of the cultivated apples (Hokanson et al., 1997). These seedlings have been planted in research orchards in a recurrent selection breeding strategy and maintained at multiple sites to allow for evaluation of general and regionally important horticultural traits and biotic and abiotic resistances. We as germplasm managers now need to assess the level of diversity within this collection to help make informed decisions on management procedures as well as on the choice of breeding strategies to use in combining horticulturally important traits in our breeding program. Historically, assessments of genetic composition of germplasm collections have been carried out at several levels including inferences based on reproductive biology, ecogeographic data, morphology, pigmentation, ontogeny, social history, pedigree records, breeding behavior, in situ and ex situ evaluation of traits, chromosome structure and behavior, protein markers, and molecular markers such as restricted fragment length polymorReceived for publication 10 July 2000.

The consequences of loss of genetic diversity have been experienced sporadically throughout history, often with significant human and economic costs, which has been a common problem with many of the world’s important food crops (Way et al., 1990). The genus Malus (apples), is characterized by large diversity, but thus far this has not been translated in the cultivated (Malus sylvestris (L) Mill. var. domestica (Borkh.) Mansf.) varieties (Way et al., 1990). Modern commercial apple orchards are dominated by only a few cultivars and many breeding programs utilize only a few well known cultivars in crosses for commercial apple production (Noiton and Shelbourne, 1992; Way et al., 1990). As a result, levels of inbreeding and coancestry in modern apples have been projected to increase (Noiton and Alspach, 1996). Awareness of genetic diversity and management of crop genetic resources have been important components of plant improvement programs. The foundation of crop-based agriculture rests largely on the availability and knowledge of extant plant phisms (RLFPs). The emergence of new polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based molecular markers, such as randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) markers, simple sequence repeats (SSRs), and amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs), has created opportunities to characterize germplasm collections at the molecular level, with markers that are presumably selectively neutral and not affected in their expression by environmental effects. The increased levels of variation detectable with these molecular markers have allowed germplasm managers, plant breeders, and geneticists to pursue with new vigor important questions relating to crops and their genetic resources (Bretting and Widrlechner, 1995). RAPD analyses have various scientific, operational, and budgetary advantages for genome mapping (Welsh and McClelland, 1990, 1991; Williams et al., 1990) and are used with a high degree of success as tools for harnessing genes from germplasm resources in our own apple genome mapping program (Gardiner et al., 1996a, 1999). These same advantages also appear valid for characterization of genetic variation for effective germplasm conservation and use, hence research in population genetics has shown the most growth with respect to the use of RAPD technology (Hedrick, 1992). RAPD markers have been used to create DNA fingerprints for the study of individual identity and taxonomic relationships in both eucaryotic and procaryotic organisms (Caetano-Anolles et al., 1991; Hu and Quiros, 1991; Kresovich et al., 1992); in apples, to differentiate cultivars (Koller et al., 1993), for paternity analysis (Harada et al., 1993), for determining genetic relationships in Malus sylvestris var. domestica cultivars and wild species (Dunemann et al., 1994), along with RFLPs and isozymes for tracing the parentage of ‘Braeburn’ (Gardiner et al., 1996b), and for phylogenetic studies (Zhou and Li, 2000). The following research was conducted to examine the distribution of genetic diversity in the HortResearch apple germplasm collection using RAPD markers. The objectives of the investigation were to 1) assess the level of diversity between and within different subsets of apple germplasm, 2) determine the similarity of the selections/cultivars within the collections and 3) determine if the gene pool of apples had been effectively enlarged with the germplasm obtained from other countries and continents. Materials and Methods PLANT MATERIAL. The HortResearch apple germplasm was divided into four subsets. Subset 1 consisted of old cultivars and breeding lines that are maintained in the repository and the National Cultivar Center (NCC), and subsets 2, 3 and 4 consisted sublines in the apple genetics population. The apple genetics population comprised open-pollinated (op) families as well as families derived from controlled crosses from primitive cultivars, cider apples, and wild species (Noiton et al., 1999), including wild accessions of Malus sieversii (Lebed.) and M. kirghisorum (Al.) Ponom. from Kazakhstan. The families were divided into four sublines and planted at the third leaf stage in randomized incomplete blocks of 20 single tree plots at three different sites over a period of 4 years as follows: 1991: 224 families (10,232 trees); 1992: 149 families (12,800 trees); 72 families (4,862 trees); and 1994: 86 families (3,665 trees). Sublining was used to control inbreeding and maximize, as far as possible, genetic variability and heterozygosity within the population (Noiton and Shelbourne, 1992). We crossed within sublines per generation since inbreeding is unlikely to be a serious problem for many generations. Nevertheless, we had planned to introduce new unrelated material after a few generations to circumvent inbreeding. Ideally, the families should have been grouped into sublines based on region of origin so that individuals from the same region will be confined to one subline. For example, families from countries in Western Europe should be in a different subline than families from countries in North America or Eastern Europe. But this never really happened in our own case, due in part to the fact that seeds were","The efficacy of the Senegal prickly-ash Zanthoxylum zanthoxyloides (Lam.) roots and the African locust bean tree Parkia biglobosa (Jacq.) pod back was study for their efficacy in the control of okra pest, Podagrica spp. The study was carried out in the laboratory and on the field in the farming season of 2018. Z. zanthoxyloides roots were obtained from Jima-Doko forest and P. biglibosa fruit back from Takunpara. Both plant materials were air-dried under shade for 120 hours. Both plant parts were pounded separately in wooden mortar with the aid of wooden pestle until the materials turns to fine particles. Determined weight of 100, 150, 200, 250, and 300 grams were taken for each plant materials and soaked in water for 24 hours and stirred at intervals of an hour. The mixture were then sieved with a muslin cloth and filtered with Whatman filter paper to eliminate all finest particles of varying sizes. These concentrations were applied individually on 10 adults of Podagrica spp. in the laboratory. It was observed that the concentration of 200 – 300g performed better for both plant materials in the control of okra flea beetle. These resulted to the death of above 50% of the insect within 2 hours. These significant laboratory trials were then formulated and taken to the field. Both plant materials acted as anti-feedants and repellants against Podagrica spp. It was also revealed that Z. zanthoxyloides performed significantly (p<0.05) better than the P. biglibosa. Furthermore, short interval applications (<or=3days) of these plant materials could be a good  replacement for synthetic chemicals, hence bio-pesticides that could be adopted for organic agriculture.","Our present @Cabra Leche Sabana experience takes place in the plain lands1of Nor. East-Venezuela, South America, at a wide natural area of neo-tropical savannas. The specific local site, is an old XIX century cattle ranch (Hato Llanero), “Curareque Urica Arriba”, of the north-eastern Anzoátegui state, with its typical BiomeEcotone, of high (250-300mts), plain lands of varied natural grassland vegetation, predominantly of the Tachypogon2 Andropogon, and Setaria native grass species. The typical native tree species of these Anzoátegui’s “Chaparral” savannas are of the fire resistant species: Curatella American (“Chaparro”), Bowditch virgiliodes (“Alcornoque”), and Brysonima crassifolia (“Chaparro Manteco”), scatter all over the plain grassland areas, or in busy cluster of forest vegetation, usually at the better soil-water sites, protected from the risk of the annual fires. Among Botanical specialist, the common opinion is that our savannas are of an anthropological (human), origin. The result of the old sociocultural use of the fire for hunting practices of the native inhabitants, together with the new disturbances, brought by civilization and its modern agricultural and oil exploitation practices.2 Our neo/tropical Mesa de Sabana plain lands are of a younger geo-physiological formation age (Paliolitic Origen), than the ‘old world’ better known African Savannas. Having good tropical bio-diverse vegetation of dry forest (Hold ridge), with abundant small-life (insects), and microscopic fungal-bacterial fauna; but without the large wild-animals diversity of the older African Savannas. The general climate and rains of the area are typical of a geographical dry monzonic zone, with a main rain period (“invierno”), of 4-6months, where 70-75% of the annual 8501200mm rainfall is recorded. The dry period (“verano”), usually occurs between December and April each year, with May and November as intermediate months period. The year round temperature fluctuates on the 22-30C range, with a very windy period, at the “verano”, helping mitigate the day’s inclement temperature.3 The climate of the windy dry period at our high table savannas (“sabanas de mesa”), is quite similar to that of other world desert zones, having very hot sunny days with cold windy nights.","Several species of Botryosphaeriaceae family are among the most aggressive pathogens associated with botryosphaeria dieback of agricultural and forestry trees. Particularly, Diplodia spp. having a cosmopolitan distribution, are well-known as virulent of woody plant hosts including Pinus spp. In recent years, symptoms of canopy wilt, branch dieback, necrosis, and trunk cankers have been noticed on Pinus pinea trees in Tunisian forests. However, this has been less welldocumented in North Africa and especially in Tunisia. The aim of this study is to characterize the causal agent of P. pinea dieback in northeastern Tunisian forest. A collection of thirty-eight isolates obtained from symptomatic branches of P. pinea trees was identified as Diplodia seriata by means of morphological characteristics, and phylogenetic analysis of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of the nuclear ribosomal DNA. A pathogenicity test was conducted on 3-years-old P. pinea seedlings, confirmed the virulence of the fungus. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first record of D. seriata associated with branch canker on P. pinea in Tunisia.","This paper is an attempt to assess the major tree species that are being traded in the state and a comparison of domestic and import prices of the most preferred species has been done. India is one of the top producers of tropical logs in the world; on the other hand it is also among the largest consumer of wood products. It is also among the top importing countries of tropical woods since it cannot match its own demand for wood products with domestic supplies (ITTO, 2015). Tamil Nadu has more than 500 small scale timber industries, with majority of them being unorganized. The price had also been fluctuating between domestic and imported wood based on their requirement, quality, size and other parameters. Forty sample respondents were selected through snow ball sampling technique and initial references were drawn from Consortium of Industrial Agroforestry (CIAF) operating at Forest College and Research Institute (Tamil Nadu Agricultural University), Mettupalayam. The price variability between domestic and imported teak was evaluated using bivariate correlation analysis. It could be found that there was significant positive correlation between the price of country teak and Ecuador teak, country teak and African teak which implied that if there is increase in price of country teak, there will be increase in price of either Ecuador or African teak and vice-versa.",15.6075897656383,3,"oil, palm, date"
