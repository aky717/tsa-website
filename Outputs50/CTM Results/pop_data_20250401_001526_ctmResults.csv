A simple random sampling was used to select 180 farmers. The data was analysed using a Multinomial logit regression model. From the results, the level of climate change and variability awareness was high and the adaptation strategies identified were mixed cropping, change crop varieties, changing planting time/date, soil conservation techniques, increased irrigation, increased female livestock herd, and seasonal migration. Farmers confirmed empirically observations that climate change would lead to a reduction in crop production. Also, gender, age, education, household size, farming experience, access to extension, access to credit, access to mobile phone and perceived decreased rainfall influenced farmers’ choices of a particular adaptation strategy. The findings support and justified calls for education of farmers on climate change and variability.","Purpose Changes in climate may have both beneficial and harmful effects on crop yields. However, the effects will be more in countries whose economy depends on agriculture. This study aims to measure the economic impacts of climate change on crop farming in Bangladesh. Design/methodology/approach A Ricardian model was used to estimate the relationship between net crop income and climate variables. Historical climate data and farm household level data from all climatic zones of Bangladesh were collected for this purpose. A regression model was then developed of net crop income per hectare against long-term climate, household and farm variables. Marginal impacts of climate change and potential future impacts of projected climate scenarios on net crop incomes were also estimated. Findings The results revealed that net crop income in Bangladesh is sensitive to climate, particularly to seasonal temperature. A positive effect of temperature rise on net crop income was observed for the farms located in the areas having sufficient irrigation facilities. Estimated marginal impact suggests that 1 mm/month increase in rainfall and 10°C increase in temperature will lead to about US$4-15 increase in net crop income per hectare in Bangladesh. However, there will be significant seasonal and spatial variations in the impacts. The assessment of future impacts under climate change scenarios projected by Global Circulation Models indicated an increase in net crop income from US$25-84 per hectare in the country. Research limitations/implications The findings of this study indicate the need for development practitioners and policy planners to consider both the beneficial and harmful effects of climate change across different climatic zones while designing and implementing the adaptation policies in the country. Originality/value Literature survey of the Web of Science, Science Direct and Google Scholar indicates that this study is the first attempt to measure the economic impacts of climate change on overall crop farming sector in Bangladesh using an econometric model.","This study analyzed the farmer-perceived importance of adaptation practices to climate change and examined the barriers that impede adaptation. Perceptions about causes and effects of long-term changes in climatic variables were also investigated. A total of 100 farmer-households were randomly selected from four communities in the Lawra district of Ghana. Data was collected using semi-structured questionnaires and focus group discussions (FGDs). The results showed that 87% of respondents perceived a decrease in rainfall amount, while 82% perceived an increase in temperature over the past 10 years. The study revealed that adaptation was largely in response to dry spells and droughts (93.2%) rather than floods. About 67% of respondents have adjusted their farming activities in response to climate change. Empirical results of the weighted average index analysis showed that farmers ranked improved crop varieties and irrigation as the most important adaptation measures. It also revealed that farmers lacked the capacity to implement the highly ranked adaptation practices. The problem confrontation index analysis showed that unpredictable weather, high cost of farm inputs, limited access to weather information, and lack of water resources were the most critical barriers to adaptation. This analysis of adaptation practices and constraints at farmer level will help facilitate government policy formulation and implementation.","This study assessed farmers’ perception of climate change, and estimated the determinants of, and evaluated the relationship among, adaptation practices using the multivariate probit model. A survey in 300 agricultural households was carried out covering 10 sample districts considering five agro-ecological zones and a vulnerability index. Four adaptation choices (change in planting date, crop variety, crop type and investment in irrigation) were deemed as outcome variables and socioeconomic, demographic, institutional, farm-level and perceptions variables were deployed as explanatory variables. Their marginal effects were determined for three climatic variables—temperature, precipitation and drought. Age, gender and education of head of household, credit access, farm area, rain-fed farming and tenure, were found to be more influential compared to other factors. All four adaptation options were found to be complimentary to each other. Importantly, the intensity of the impact of dependent variables in different models, and for the available adaptation options, were found to be unequal. Therefore, policy options and support facilities should be devised according to climatic variables and adaptation options to achieve superior results.","Abstract. Climate change is a global environmental threat to all economic sectors, particularly the agricultural sector. Pakistan is one of the countries negatively affected by climate change due to its high exposure to extreme events and low adaptive capacity. In Pakistan, farmers are the primary stakeholders in agriculture and are more at risk due to climate vulnerability. Based on farm household data from 450 households collected from three districts in three agroecological zones in the Punjab province of Pakistan, this study examines how farmers perceive climate change and how they adapt their farming in response to perceived changes in climate. The results demonstrate that awareness of climate change is widespread throughout the area, and farm households make adjustments to adapt their agriculture in response to climatic change. Overall 58% of the farm households adapted their farming to climate change. Changing crop varieties, changing planting dates, planting of shade trees and changing fertilizers were the main adaptation methods implemented by farm households in the study area. The results from the binary logistic model reveal that education, farm experience, household size, land area, tenancy status, ownership of a tube well, access to market information, information on weather forecasting and agricultural extension services all influence farmers' choices of adaptation measures. The results also indicate that adaptation to climate change is constrained by several factors such as lack of information, lack of money, resource constraints and shortage of irrigation water in the study area. Findings of the study suggest the need for greater investment in farmer education and improved institutional setup for climate change adaptation to improve farmers' wellbeing.","Understanding of local people’s perception on environmental conditions is crucial to design and implement appropriate adaptation strategies to climate change and variability. This study looked at communities’ perception of climate change impacts, barriers and effective adaptation strategies towards climate change in selected districts of western Oromia. This study examines smallholder farmers’ perceptions of climate variability, climate change and its impacts on crop production, and adaptation strategies adopted over the past three 30 years. Survey data were collected from 204 respondents using both qualitative and quantitative approaches through purposive sampling techniques. Descriptive statistics such as percentage and frequency were used for data analysis. The results of the study showed that the respondents were perceived, the occurrence of climate change in terms of increase in temperatures, decrease in rainfall and change in timing of rain, change in the onset of rains, erratic rainfall pattern. The study also indicated that due to climate change induced factors the agricultural productivity was reduced from time to time. The results show that about 80%) of farmers who participated had observed recent changes in climate. Perceptions of local communities on climate change and variability are consistent with the analyzed historical climate data. The analyzed climate data show fluctuations in onset date, cessation date and length of growing season (LGS) and change in climate. Farmers perceived weather related problems such as low rain, drought, flood, heat, cold, strong wind that led increased farming problems such as soil erosion, loss of soil fertility; reduction in crop yields and high rate of disease occurrence. The impacts of climate change on crop production were revealed by changes in start of farming season; including: rainfall coming early or late, decrease in rainfall, increase in temperature and increase in farming problems, in particular, increase in soil erosion, loss of soil fertility and reduction in crop yields. The results showed that farmers perceived climate change in terms of changes in rainfall and temperature, increase in drought condition, crop pests and diseases. Those changes had significant impact on farmers’ households whose income depends on rain fed farming. The findings revealed that the impacts of climate in rural areas include reduced in crop yield (49%); increase in pest and disease (34%) and soil erosion (98%). Respondents perceived the main cause of climate change was human action through; intensified agriculture, deforestation, increased use of fossil fuel and use of chemical fertilizer on farms. Therefore, to adapt to the changing in climate, farming community practiced some adaptation measure. The adaptation measures identified were soil and water conservation, crop rotation, change crop varieties, change planting dates, late planting, diversification of crop types and varieties, drought resistant varieties, building water harvesting schemes and use of irrigation. Widely used adaptation measures are soil and water conservation, crop rotation, changing planting dates and change crop varieties in the study area. Besides, the finding identified some serious barriers of adaptation measure to climate change including lack of information, shortage of labor, lack of capital, black of access to water and poor potential for irrigation. Therefore, there is a need to focus community dimensions such as perceptions of smallholder farmers. The study recommends enhanced knowledge of climate change and climate smart agriculture practices for their improved adoption.","The study examines how farmers’ observations of climate variability and change correspond with 42 years (1970-2011) meteorological data of temperature and rainfall. It shows how farmers in the Northern Region of Ghana adjust to the changing climate and explore the various obstacles that hinder the implementation of their adaptation strategies. With the help of an extension officer, 200 farmers from 20 communities were randomly selected based on their farming records. Temperatures over the last four decades (1970-2009) increased at a rate of 0.04 (± 0.41) ˚C and 0.3(± 0.13)˚C from 2010-2011 which is consistent to the farmers (82.5%) observations. Rainfall within the districts are characterised by inter-annual and monthly variability. It experienced an increased rate of 0.66 (± 8.30) mm from 1970-2009, which was inconsistent with the farmers (81.5%) observation. It however decreased from 2010-2011 at a huge rate of -22.49 (±15.90) mm which probably was the reason majority of the respondents claim rainfall was decreasing. Only 64.5% of the respondents had adjusted their farming activities because of climate variability and change. They apply fertilizers and pesticides, practice soil and water conservation, and irrigation for communities close to dams. Respondents desire to continue their current adaptation methods but may in the future consider changing crop variety, water-harvesting techniques, change crop production to livestock keeping, and possibly migrate to urban centers. Lack of climate change education, low access to credit and agricultural inputs are some militating factors crippling the farmers’ effort to adapt to climate change.","Food insecurity is a big challenge which Nigeria is currently battling with. This is compounded by the negative effects of climate change on agricultural production, and by extension, rural development. This work was therefore designed to ascertain crop farmers’ perception of, and adaptation to climate change in Orlu agricultural zone of Imo State. The objectives of the study were to: assess farmers’ level of awareness of elements of climate change, ascertain the extent farmers perceived climate change in the zone, find out the various effects of climate change in the area as perceived by the farmers, and ascertain the adjustment strategies adopted by the farmers. Data were collected from one hundred and twenty (120) crop farmers randomly selected from the zone, using interview schedule. Percentage, means, frequency distribution as well as multiple regression model were used to analyze the data. Most of the farmers (98.33%) experienced climate change in the area and that changes in rainfall pattern were most prominent. Farmers perceived reduced crop yield, drought and increased flooding, among others, as the greatest adverse effects of climate change. Some of the strategies adopted to combat the adverse effects included; adjustment in planting period, use of improved crop varieties, adoption of improved farming methods, among others. Age, farming experience, educational level and membership of social organizations were significant factors that influenced farmers’ perception of climate change in the area. Some of the recommendations include; extension agents should advice farmers to adopt early planting and harvesting before adverse climate conditions get to their peak, government and non-governmental organizations should assist farmers with irrigation facilities so that they will not be solely dependent on rain fed agriculture, among others.","Farmer perception of their environment is a factor of climate change. Adaptation to climate change requires farmers to realize that the climate has changed and they must identify useful adaptations and implement them. This study analyzed the per-ception of climate change among rural farmers in central agri-cultural zone of Delta State, Nigeria. Climate change studies often assume certain adaptations and minimal examination of how, when, why, and conditions under which adaptations usually take place in any economic and social systems. The study was conducted by survey method on 131 respondents using struc-tured interview schedule and questionnaire. Data were analyzed with descriptive statistics and linear regression model to test that education, gender, and farming experience influenced farmers’ perception of climate change. The results showed that the farmers were aware of climate change. The identified causes of climate change were ranging from intensified agriculture, population explosion, increased use of fossil fuel, loss of in-digenous know practice to gas flaring. The effects of climate change on crops and livestocks were also identified by the rural farmers. Many of the farmers adapted to climate change by planting trees, carrying out soil conservation practice, changing planting dates, using different crop varieties, installing fans in livestock pens, and applying irrigation. Almost half of them did not adapt to climate change. The linear regression analysis revealed that education, gender, and farming experience influ-enced farmers’ perception of climate change. The major barriers to adaptation to climate change included lack of information, lack of money, and inadequate land.","In most of the developing countries, lack of resources and little market accessibility are among the major factors that affect small farming household food security. This study aims to investigate the status of small farming households’ food security, and its determinants including the role of market accessibility factors in enhancing food security at household level. In addition, this study also determines the households’ perception about different kinds of livelihoods risks. This study is based on a household survey of 576 households conducted through face-to-face interviews using structured interviews in Punjab, Pakistan. Food security status is calculated using dietary intake method. The study findings show that one-fourth of the households are food insecure. The study findings reveal that farm households perceive increase in food prices, crop diseases, lack of irrigation water and increase in health expenses as major livelihood risks. Further, the results of logistic regression show that family size, monthly income, food prices, health expenses and debt are main factors influencing the food security status of rural households. Furthermore, the market accessibility factors (road distance and transportation cost) do significantly affect the small farming household food security. The results suggest that local food security can be enhanced by creating off-farm employment opportunities, improved transportation facilities and road infrastructure.",23.2800343006332,Climate Variability Impact

This study assesses the water footprint of ten staple crops grown in different regions across the country and evaluates the impact of crop water use in different regions/watersheds by the water stress index and the indication of water deprivation potential. The ten crops include major rice, second rice, maize, soybean, mungbean, peanut, cassava, sugarcane, pineapple and oil palm. The water stress index of the 25 major watersheds in Thailand has been evaluated. The results show that there are high variations of crop water requirements grown in different regions due to many factors. However, based on the current cropping systems, the Northeastern region has the highest water requirement for both green water (or rain water) and blue water (or irrigation water). Rice (paddy) farming requires the highest amount of irrigation water, i.e., around 10,489 million m 3 /year followed by the maize, sugarcane, oil palm and cassava. Major rice cultivation induces the","Significance Rice is a highly interdependent crop. Rice required far more labor than dryland crops like wheat, and rice’s irrigation networks forced farmers to coordinate water use. To deal with these demands, rice villages developed strong norms for labor exchange. Using China as a natural test case, we compare nearby provinces that differ in rice and wheat, but share the same ethnicity, religion, and national government. In survey data from over 11,000 Chinese citizens, rice-farming provinces report tighter norms than traditionally wheat-growing provinces. Rice also predicts tight norms around the world. These data suggest that China’s agricultural past still shapes cultural differences in the modern day—and perhaps explain why East Asia has tighter social norms than the wheat-growing West. Data recently published in PNAS mapped out regional differences in the tightness of social norms across China [R. Y. J. Chua, K. G. Huang, M. Jin, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 116, 6720–6725 (2019)]. Norms were tighter in developed, urbanized areas and weaker in rural areas. We tested whether historical paddy rice farming has left a legacy on social norms in modern China. Premodern rice farming could plausibly create strong social norms because paddy rice relied on irrigation networks. Rice farmers coordinated their water use and kept track of each person’s labor contributions. Rice villages also established strong norms of reciprocity to cope with labor demands that were twice as high as dryland crops like wheat. In line with this theory, China’s historically rice-farming areas had tighter social norms than wheat-farming areas, even beyond differences in development and urbanization. Rice–wheat differences were just as large among people in 10 neighboring provinces (n = 3,835) along the rice–wheat border. These neighboring provinces differ sharply in rice and wheat, but little in latitude, temperature, and other potential confounding variables. Outside of China, rice farming predicted norm tightness in 32 countries around the world. Finally, people in rice-farming areas scored lower on innovative thinking, which tends to be lower in societies with tight norms. This natural test case within China might explain why East Asia—historically reliant on rice farming—has tighter social norms than the wheat-farming West.","Food is a basic necessity of life. It is the means by which man is nourished and strengthened to carry out his daily activities. The need for food for the upkeep of man has placed agriculture at the helm of man’s affairs on earth. With a rapidly increasing population on earth, man has invented newer and innovative ways to cultivate crops. This cultivation is mainly concentrated in rural areas of countries around the world; but with the massive urbanization happening in the world today; it is becoming increasingly difficult to have enough agricultural produce that will cater for the massive population. Taking Nigeria as a case study, the increased urbanization has placed a massive demand on land, energy and water resources within urban areas of the country. Majority of the food consumed in the urban areas is cultivated in the rural areas. This system however requires longer transportation times from rural areas to urban areas which lead to contamination and spoilage in many instances. This research paper provides a solution in which food crops can be cultivated easily in urban areas by planting in vertically stacked layers in order to save space and use minimal energy and water for irrigation.","Florida is riddled with sinkholes due to its karst topography. Sometimes these sinkholes can cause extensive damage to infrastructure and homes. It has been suggested that agricultural practices, such as sprinkler irrigation methods used to protect crops, can increase the development of sinkholes, particularly when temperatures drop below freezing, causing groundwater levels to drop quickly during groundwater pumping. In the strawberry growing region, Dover/Plant City, Florida, the effects have caused water shortages resulting in dry- wells and ground subsidence through the development of sinkholes that can be costly to maintain and repair. In this study, we look at how frost-freeze events have affected West Central Florida over the past 25 years with detailed comparisons made between two cold-years (with severe frost-freeze events) and a warm year (no frost-freeze events). We analyzed the spatial and temporal correlation between strawberry farming freeze protection practices and the development of sinkholes/dry well complaints, and assessed the economic impact of such events from a water management perspective by evaluating the cost of repairing and drilling new wells and how these compared with using alternative crop-protection methods. We found that the spatial distribution of sinkholes was non-random during both frost-freeze events. A strong correlation between sinkhole occurrence and water extraction and minimum temperatures was found. Furthermore as temperatures fall below 41°F and water levels decrease by more than 20 ft, the number of sinkholes increase greatly (N >10). At this time alternative protection methods such as freeze-cloth are cost prohibitive in comparison to repairing dry wells. In conclusion, the findings from this study are applicable in other agricultural areas and can be used to develop comprehensive water management plans in areas where the abstraction of large quantities of water occur.","This research surveyed the effects of land use changes on flow nitrate pollution in the Talar River (northern Iran), using Landsat images of 1991 and 2013 and the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT). The results indicated that forest areas decreased by 14.9% and irrigated crops, dry land farming areas, range lands and residential areas increased by 46.8%, 31.1%, 4.7% and 17.5%, respectively. To calibrate and validate the studied period, the Nash Sutcliffe model efficiency (NSE) and coefficient of determination (R2) were applied, ranging from 0.57 to 0.75 and from 0.62 to 0.76 for flow simulation and 0.84 and 0.63 and 0.75 and 0.83 for nitrate simulation, respectively. The results of land use scenarios indicated that respective water flow and nitrate loads increased by 34.4% and 42.2% in 1991–2013 and may even increase by 42.3% and 55.9% in the simulated period of 2013–2050 in all sub-basins. It is likely that the main reason for these results was due to the increase in agricultural activities and the decrease in forestry areas. Our findings showed the useful combination of modelling techniques (land cover changes and SWAT) to develop valuable maps able to design correct land management plans and nature-based solutions for water quality of runoff water harvesting systems in the future.","Increasing dependence on groundwater requires a detailed determination of the different outputs and inputs of a basin for better water management. Determination of spatial and temporal actual evapotranspiration (ETa), in this regard, is of vital importance as there is significant water loss from drainage basins. This research paper uses the Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL), as well as the water balance, to estimate the spatial and temporal ETa in the Al-Khazir Gomal Basin, Northern Iraq. To compensate for the shortage in rainfall, and to irrigate summer crops, farmers in this basin have been depending, to a large extent, on groundwater extracted from the underlying unconfined aquifer, which is considered the major source for both domestic and agricultural uses in this basin. Rainfed farming of wheat and barley is one of the most important activities in the basin in the winter season, while in the summer season, agricultural activity is limited to small rice fields and narrow strips of vegetable cultivation along the Al-Khazir River. The Landsat Thematic Mapper images (TM5) acquired on 21 November 2006, 9 March 2007, 5 May 2007, 21 July 2007, and 23 September 2007 were used, along with a digital elevation model (DEM) and ground-based meteorological data, measured within the area of interest. Estimation of seasonal ETa from periods between satellite overpasses was computed using the evaporative fraction (Ʌ). The water balance approach was utilized, using meteorological data and river hydrograph analysis, to estimate the ETa as the only missing input in the predefined water balance equation. The results of the two applied methods were comparable. SEBAL results were compared with the land use land cover (LULC) map. The river showed the highest ETa, as evaporation from the free-water surface. Rice fields, irrigated in the summer season, have a high ETa in the images, as these fields are immersed in water during June, July and August. Vegetated corridors along the riverside showed different ETa values, as they contain a mosaic of different crops in different stages of growth. Conglomerate and bare sandstone outcrops showed no ETa, with some exceptions in the mountainous area, where these outcrops are affected by perennial springs. The results indicate the applicability of SEBAL in the study area, and they could be used in further studies to estimate the water budget of the basin.","As the key principle of precision farming, variation of actual crop evapotranspiration (ET) within the field serves as the basis for crop management. Although the estimation of evapotranspiration has achieved great progress through the combination of different remote sensing data and the FAO-56 crop coefficient (Kc) method, lack of the accurate crop water stress coefficient (Ks) at different space–time scales still hinder its operational application to farmer practices. This work aims to explore the potential of multispectral images taken from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for estimating the temporal and spatial variability of Ks under the water stress condition and mapping the variability of field maize ET combined with the FAO-56 Kc model. To search for an optimal estimation method, the performance of several models was compared including models based on Ks either derived from the crop water stress index (CWSI) or calculated by the canopy temperature ratio (Tc ratio), and combined with the basal crop coefficient (Kcb) based on the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). Compared with the Ks derived from the Tc ratio, the CWSI-based Ks responded well to water stress and had strong applicability and convenience. The results of the comparison show that ET derived from the Ks-CWSI had a higher correlation with the modified FAO-56 method, with an R2 = 0.81, root mean square error (RMSE) = 0.95 mm/d, and d = 0.94. In contrast, ET derived from the Ks-Tc ratio had a relatively lower correlation with an R2 = 0.68 and RMSE = 1.25 mm/d. To obtain the evapotranspiration status of the whole maize field and formulate reasonable irrigation schedules, the CWSI obtained by a handheld infrared thermometer was inverted by the renormalized difference vegetation index (RDVI) and the transformed chlorophyll absorption in reflectance index (TCARI). Then, the whole map of Ks can be derived from the VIs by the relationship between CWSI and Ks and can be taken as the basic input for ET estimation at the field scale. The final ET results based on multispectral UAV interpolation measurements can well reflect the crop ET status under different irrigation levels, and greatly help to improve irrigation scheduling through more precise management of deficit irrigation.","This paper explores the nature, source and spatial variation of the salinity of water used for irrigation in a coastal urban farming area in Cape Town, South Africa, where water from the Cape Flats aquifer is drawn into storage ponds and used for crop irrigation. Water samples were collected in summer and winter from selected sites across the study area and were analysed for salinity as well as for concentrations of major and minor ions. Each site consists of one borehole and one pond. Isotope analysis was done for the summer samples so as to assess effects of evaporation on water quality and salin ity. Descriptive statistics were used to compare the variation in range of concentration of specific ions with the recom mended ranges set by the South African Department of Water Affairs and Forestry (DWAF) and the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO). Geographical information system (GIS) analysis was used to describe the spatial distribution of salinity across the study area, and hydro-geochemical analysis was used to assess the possibility of seawater intrusion into the aquifer system and to characterise groundwater in the study area. The results of the research showed that the concentrations of chloride, nitrate, potassium and sodium exceeded the target maximum limit according to DWAF and FAO guidelines. Groundwater and pond water were also observed to be brackish in most parts of the research area in terms of total dissolved salts content, and fresh water was only found in the middle section of the research area. It is concluded that the accumulation of salts in groundwater and soil in the study area is mainly due to the agricultural activities and partially due to the natural movement of water through the geological formation of the Cape Flats region. These findings permit the formulation of a conceptual model of the occurrence of the salinization process, which implies that the groundwater and pond water in the study area are generally suitable for irrigation purposes, but need to be used with caution as the vegetables grown are classified as sensitive and moderately sensitive to salt according to DWAF guidelines for irrigation water quality (1996). The research paves a way for possible quantitative simulation of salt mass balance in future.","ABSTRACT The goal of this study was to map rainfed and irrigated rice-fallow cropland areas across South Asia, using MODIS 250 m time-series data and identify where the farming system may be intensified by the inclusion of a short-season crop during the fallow period. Rice-fallow cropland areas are those areas where rice is grown during the kharif growing season (June–October), followed by a fallow during the rabi season (November–February). These cropland areas are not suitable for growing rabi-season rice due to their high water needs, but are suitable for a short -season (≤3 months), low water-consuming grain legumes such as chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.), black gram, green gram, and lentils. Intensification (double-cropping) in this manner can improve smallholder farmer’s incomes and soil health via rich nitrogen-fixation legume crops as well as address food security challenges of ballooning populations without having to expand croplands. Several grain legumes, primarily chickpea, are increasingly grown across Asia as a source of income for smallholder farmers and at the same time providing rich and cheap source of protein that can improve the nutritional quality of diets in the region. The suitability of rainfed and irrigated rice-fallow croplands for grain legume cultivation across South Asia were defined by these identifiers: (a) rice crop is grown during the primary (kharif) crop growing season or during the north-west monsoon season (June–October); (b) same croplands are left fallow during the second (rabi) season or during the south-east monsoon season (November–February); and (c) ability to support low water-consuming, short-growing season (≤3 months) grain legumes (chickpea, black gram, green gram, and lentils) during rabi season. Existing irrigated or rainfed crops such as rice or wheat that were grown during kharif were not considered suitable for growing during the rabi season, because the moisture/water demand of these crops is too high. The study established cropland classes based on the every 16-day 250 m normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) time series for one year (June 2010–May 2011) of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data, using spectral matching techniques (SMTs), and extensive field knowledge. Map accuracy was evaluated based on independent ground survey data as well as compared with available sub-national level statistics. The producers’ and users’ accuracies of the cropland fallow classes were between 75% and 82%. The overall accuracy and the kappa coefficient estimated for rice classes were 82% and 0.79, respectively. The analysis estimated approximately 22.3 Mha of suitable rice-fallow areas in South Asia, with 88.3% in India, 0.5% in Pakistan, 1.1% in Sri Lanka, 8.7% in Bangladesh, 1.4% in Nepal, and 0.02% in Bhutan. Decision-makers can target these areas for sustainable intensification of short-duration grain legumes.","Using reclaimed water from treated wastewater as an irrigation source is gaining popularity in arid and semi-arid areas. However, life cycle assessment studies, utilizing experimental data to analyze the environmental and health impacts of crops irrigated with reclaimed water, are lacking. This study presents the first comparative life cycle assessment of corn, soybean and wheat systems irrigated with groundwater and reclaimed water in Northern China. While the life cycle foreground inventory was based on a combination of experimental and modeling datasets, the life cycle background inventory was compiled with commercially available data packages augmented with Chinese electricity mix data. The life cycle impact analyses were based on the characterization factors from state-of-art life cycle impact assessment models. The analyses indicated that the life cycle global warming impacts of the crop systems ranged from 0.37 to 0.64 kg CO2-eq/kg grain, with reclaimed water irrigated soybean and ground water irrigated wheat exhibiting, respectively, the lowest and highest global warming impacts. Irrigation, farming equipment operation, on-field emissions and fertilizer production ranked as top contributors to the life cycle impacts for corn, soybean, and wheat. The comparative analyses of irrigation sources suggested that significant environmental tradeoffs existed. Replacing groundwater with reclaimed water as the irrigation source significantly decreased life cycle global warming, acidification, ozone depletion, smog formation, and respiratory impacts of corn, soybean and wheat systems. However, replacing groundwater with reclaimed water increased the life cycle noncancer impacts of those systems. Coordinating policies within the water–food–health nexus is required, in order to minimize the environmental tradeoffs, while maximizing the benefits of irrigation with reclaimed water.",20.6318785864097,Irrigation and Water Use

Surprisingly little is known about their impacts on soil microbial functional diversity, and especially so in irrigated Mediterranean ecosystems. In long-term experimental plots at the West Side Research and Extension Center in California’s Central Valley, we characterized soil microbial communities in the presence or absence of physical disturbance due to tillage, in the presence or absence of cover crops, and at three depths: 0–5, 5–15 and 15–30 cm. This characterization included qPCR for bacterial and archaeal abundances, DNA sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene, and phylogenetic estimation of two ecologically important microbial traits (rRNA gene copy number and genome size). Total (bacterial + archaeal) diversity was higher in no-till than standard till; diversity increased with depth in no-till but decreased with depth in standard till. Total bacterial numbers were higher in cover cropped plots at all depths, while no-till treatments showed higher numbers in 0–5 cm but lower numbers at lower depths compared to standard tillage. Trait estimates suggested that different farming practices and depths favored distinctly different microbial life strategies. Tillage in the absence of cover crops shifted microbial communities towards fast growing competitors, while no-till shifted them toward slow growing stress tolerators. Across all treatment combinations, increasing depth resulted in a shift towards stress tolerators. Cover crops shifted the communities towards ruderals–organisms with wider metabolic capacities and moderate rates of growth. Overall, our results are consistent with decreasing nutrient availability with soil depth and under no-till treatments, bursts of nutrient availability and niche homogenization under standard tillage, and increases in C supply and variety provided by cover crops. Understanding how agricultural practices shift microbial abundance, diversity and life strategies, such as presented here, can assist with designing farming systems that can support high yields, while enhancing C sequestration and increasing resilience to climate change.","Cover cropping plays a key role in the maintenance of arable soil health and the enhancement of agroecosystem services. However, our understanding of how cover crop management impacts soil microbial communities and how these interactions might affect soil nutrient cycling is still limited. Here, we studied the impact of four cover crop mixtures varying in species richness and functional diversity, three cover crop termination strategies (i.e., frost, rolling, and glyphosate) and two levels of irrigation at the cover crop sowing on soil nitrogen and carbon dynamics, soil microbial diversity, and structure as well as the abundance of total bacteria, archaea, and N-cycling microbial guilds. We found that total nitrogen and soil organic carbon were higher when cover crops were killed by frost compared to rolling and glyphosate termination treatments, while cover crop biomass was positively correlated to soil carbon and C:N ratio. Modifications of soil properties due to cover crop management rather than the composition of cover crop mixtures were related to changes in the abundance of ammonia oxidizers and denitrifiers, while there was no effect on the total bacterial abundance. Unraveling the underlying processes by which cover crop management shapes soil physico-chemical properties and bacterial communities is of importance to help selecting optimized agricultural practices for sustainable farming systems.","ABSTRACT We integrate functional weed ecology with crop stable carbon and nitrogen isotope analysis to assess their combined potential for inferring arable land management practices in (semi-)arid regions from archaeobotanical assemblages. Weed and GIS survey of 60 cereal and pulse fields in Morocco are combined with crop sampling for stable isotope analysis to frame assessment of agricultural labour intensity in terms of manuring, irrigation, tillage and hand-weeding. Under low management intensity weed variation primarily reflects geographical differences, whereas under high management intensity fields in disparate regions have similar weed flora. Manured and irrigated oasis barley fields are clearly discriminated from less intensively manured rain-fed barley terraces in southern Morocco; when fields in northern and southern Morocco are considered together, climatic differences are superimposed on the agronomic intensity gradient. Barley δ13C and δ15N values clearly distinguish among the Moroccan regimes. An integrated approach combines crop isotope values with weed ecological discrimination of low- and high-intensity regimes across multiple studies (in southern Morocco and southern Europe). Analysis of archaeobotanical samples from EBA Tell Brak, Syria suggests that this early city was sustained through extensive (low-intensity, large-scale) cereal farming.","Meeting global demand of safe and healthy food for the ever-increasing population now and into the future is currently a crucial challenge. Increasing crop production by preserving environment and mitigating climate change should thus be the main goal of today’s agriculture. Conventional farming is characterized by use of high-yielding varieties, irrigation water, chemical fertilizers and synthetic pesticides to increase yields. However, due to either over- or misuse of chemical fertilizers or pesticides in many agro-ecosystems, such farming is often blamed for land degradation and environmental pollution and for adversely affecting the health of humans, plants, animals and aquatic ecosystems. Of all inputs required for increased agricultural production, nutrients are considered to be the most important ones. Organic farming, with use of organic sources of nutrients, is proposed as a sustainable strategy for producing safe, healthy and cheaper food and for restoring soil fertility and mitigating climate change. However, there are several myths and controversies surrounding the use of organic versus inorganic sources of nutrients. The objectives of this paper are: (i) to clarify some of the myths or misconceptions about organic versus inorganic sources of nutrients and (ii) to propose alternative solutions to increase on-farm biomass production for use as organic inputs for improving soil fertility and increasing crop yields. Common myths identified by this review include that organic materials/fertilizers can: (i) supply all required macro- and micro-nutrients for plants; (ii) improve physical, chemical and microbiological properties of soils; (iii) be applied universally on all soils; (iv) always produce quality products; (v) be cheaper and affordable; and (vi) build-up of large amount of soil organic matter. Other related myths are: “legumes can use entire amount of N2 fixed from atmosphere” and “bio-fertilizers increase nutrient content of soil.” Common myths regarding chemical fertilizers are that they: (i) are not easily available and affordable, (ii) degrade land, (iii) pollute environment and (iv) adversely affect health of humans, animals and agro-ecosystems. The review reveals that, except in some cases where higher yields (and higher profits) can be found from organic farming, their yields are generally 20–50% lower than that from conventional farming. The paper demonstrates that considering the current organic sources of nutrients in the developing countries, organic nutrients alone are not enough to increase crop yields to meet global food demand and that nutrients from inorganic and organic sources should preferably be applied at 75:25 ratio. The review identifies a new and alternative concept of Evergreen Agriculture (an extension of Agroforestry System), which has potential to supply organic nutrients in much higher amounts, improve on-farm soil fertility and meet nutrient demand of high-yielding crops, sequester carbon and mitigate greenhouse gas emissions, provide fodder for livestock and fuelwood for farmers and has potential to meet global food demand. Evergreen Agriculture has been widely adapted by tens of millions of farmers in several African countries and the review proposes for evaluation and scaling-up of such technology in Asian and Latin American countries too.","A field survey along with a review of secondary data were conducted to improve understanding on cattle production systems in Sri Lanka. The extent of agricultural land in the country is 1.9 million hectares and 75% of this is used by small holders. The total number of small holdings is about 1.8 million and more than 90% are less than 2 hectares in extent and one third engage in crop- livestock farming. The cattle population is 1.7 million and 65%, 19% and 16% are found in the dry, intermediate and wet zones, respectively and are reared primarily by small-holder fanners. The field survey revealed that cattle popula- tion consisted of indigenous zebu, exotic zebu, zebucrosses, exoticBos taurus and taurus crosses. Four distinct production systems were identified: 1. dry zone traditional village system (DTVS); 2. dry zone irrigated settlement system (DISS); 3. intermediate zone system (IS) and 4. wet zone system (WS). Most prevalent system was DTVS where zebu cattle of mostly indigenous origin were maintained on communal grazing lands with minimal inputs. Primary income of farmers was from meat (45%) while milk, manure and draught contributed 34%, 12% and 9%, respectively. In DISS small herds of dairy type zebu animals were maintained intensively. Milk brought the major income (52%) while meat, draught and manure contributed, 21%, 21% and 6%, respectively. In the IS zebu and taurine crosses were maintained semi-intensively. Primary income was from milk (67%); meat, manure and draught contributed 13%, 11% and 995, respectively. In WS taurine dairy cows were maintained intensively. Milk brought 91% of the income while meat, manure and draught contributed 4%, 4% and 1%, respectively. This study showed that cattle production systems in the country are heterogeneous with specific factors affecting the sustainability and productivity of each system.","Despite the fact that sustainable agricultural technologies and practices have been developed and introduced to farmers in both developed and developing countries, there are concerns about low levels of adoption. Empirical evidence of the past 40 years shows that adoption of new practices can be hindered by a wide range of factors, from financial to attitudinal, from personal to social, from agronomic to regulatory. Conclusions that can be generalised across different contexts could help in moving the institutional and policy environment in a direction that strengthens the move towards a more sustainable food production. This is particularly important regarding hotspots of environmental pollution, for example, the release of reactive nitrogen compounds in South Asia. This paper followed the PRISMA protocol and systematically reviewed the adoption literature in South Asia to identify factors that affect farmers' decisions to adopt sustainable agricultural technologies and practices. We found that education, extension and training, soil quality, irrigation, income and credit are significant drivers of farmers' adoption decisions. Consequently, efforts to promote the adoption of sustainable nitrogen management technologies will have to be tailored to consider these factors. We conclude that the variables that explain adoption in the studies reviewed could provide a foundation invaluable to research and policies that facilitate the adoption of sustainable nitrogen management technologies and practices in South Asia.","In the post independence period, the most important challenge in India has been to produce enough food for the growing population. Hence, high-yielding varieties are being used with infusion of irrigation water, fertilizers, or pesticides. This combination of high-yielding production technology has helped the country develop a food surplus as well as contributing to concerns of soil health, environmental pollution, pesticide toxicity, and sustainability of agricultural production. Scientists and policy planners are, therefore, reassessing agricultural practices which relied more on biological inputs rather than heavy usage of chemical fertilizers and pesticides. Organic farming can provide quality food without adversely affecting the soil’s health and the environment; however, a concern is whether large-scale organic farming will produce enough food for India’s large population. Certified organic products including all varieties of food products including basmati rice, pulses, honey, tea, spices, coffee, oilseeds, fruits, cereals, herbal medicines, and their value-added products are produced in India. Non edible organic products include cotton, garments, cosmetics, functional food products, body care products, and similar products. The production of these organic crops and products is reviewed with regard to sustainable agriculture in northern India.","Similar to the human gut are plants and in particular plant roots tightly associated with complex microbial communities. Microbiomes of both, gut and plants, are known for their importance for the host's nutrient uptake, protection against pathogens and abiotic stress as well as for providing metabolic capacities (Sekirov et al., 2010; Mitter et al., 2013; Ramirez-Puebla et al., 2013). The plant microbiome has been further suggested as an extension of the host phenotype (Aleklett and Hart, 2013). Plant–microbe interactions are highly specific with plant microbiota being driven by the host genotype and physiology (e.g. root exudates and metabolites) as well as environmental factors (Rasche et al., 2006; Lundberg et al., 2012). Few examples of beneficial plant–microbe interactions are well investigated and explored in regard to their importance in agricultural systems. These include biological nitrogen fixation by rhizobia, which establish a symbiosis with legumes and represent the basis of crop rotations including legumes contributing to the maintenance of soil fertility. Furthermore, about 80% of land plant species are internally colonized by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. In this symbiosis, arbuscules and vesicles are formed from the hyphae being particularly important for plant nutrient acquisition. In addition, the more specialized symbiotic defensive mutualism between Pooideae grasses and endophytic fungi of the Epichloe is well explored (Clay, 1988) and important for pasture production. Apart from these well-known mutualistic plant–microbe interactions, beneficial microorganisms have been hardly considered in crop production strategies. However, considering the demonstrated functional importance of the plant microbiome, the effects that can be observed upon the inoculation of selected microorganisms and the fact that plants and microorganisms carry genetic determinants needed for their interaction, we predict that plant microbiome functions will be an essential component of tomorrow's crop production. Plant microbiome composition is affected by various host-driven factors, including for instance the plant genotype, and by agricultural practices such as fertilization or pesticide application. Although we still hardly understand how microbiome functioning is affected by such structural changes, it is likely that functioning will be affected as well. Whereas conventional agriculture has not yet started to consider potential harm on the functioning of plant-associated microbiota due to current practices, organic farming systems generally aim at making best use of natural resources and maintaining biodiversity (Mader et al., 2002). For instance, crop rotations with legumes are applied, and usually higher plant diversity is used or maintained resulting in a more efficient exploration and maintenance of microbial functions. Alongside the general trend to increase the sustainability of agricultural practices such as different soil preparation practices, fertilizer or pesticide treatments might be better selected in regard to favouring or exhibiting least adverse effects on desirable plant microbiome functions. Apart from efficacy, the effect on the plant microbiome could be one selection criterion. Furthermore, dosage effects might be important to consider. Overdosing fertilizers or pesticides might have more adverse effects on microbiome activities than lower amounts still suitable for suitable efficacy. Industry has started to exploit individual microorganisms mostly as microbial plant protection products or as biofertilizers. There is a rapidly increasing interest from the industry on microbial products due to a far higher demand of alternatives to current pesticides and fertilizers strongly promoted by national strategic plans to restrict chemical input in agriculture. However, despite the high potential such microbial inoculants have frequently shown in lab and greenhouse experiments, the efficacy and the consistency of desired effects of microorganisms under various field conditions still represent a major bottleneck for product development. Therefore, there is an urgent need to improve selection processes, application techniques and particularly to better understand the interaction between plants and microorganisms under field conditions. Tremendous information on the mechanisms involved in plant–microbe interactions has been obtained with model plants grown under gnotobiotic conditions. Now, scientists have started to realize that for improving field efficiency, it is of utmost importance to use relevant plant cultivars and to better understand microbial activities in the field. Such an understanding will reveal under which (field-relevant) conditions a microbial strain exhibits desired activities, or whether co-colonizing microorganisms promote or interfere with specific activities of an inoculant strain. This in combination with improved application technologies and improved formulations will greatly improve the efficacy of microbial products. In the future, we will also be able to make better use of synergistic and complementary mechanisms of individual strains and design microbiomes supporting plant growth and health. Similarly, concepts might be developed considering the transplantation of microbiomes, for instance plant microbiomes growing well under adverse conditions could serve as inoculants or at least as model for the design of ‘synthetic’ microbiomes. Plants respond to microbiota, have genetic determinants to interact with microorganisms, and relationships between host and microbiome evolution have been shown (Bouffaud et al., 2014; Delaux et al., 2014). This implies that plants could be improved either by genetic improvement, selection or breeding in regard to a more efficient interaction with beneficial microorganisms. Whereas in the last decades, plants have been mostly improved and selected for higher yield and resistance, gazing into our crystal ball we foresee that efficient interaction with beneficial microorganisms will be an additional breeding target. Applications might range from breeding legumes for improved interaction with well-known rhizobial symbionts to crops reducing interactions with specific pathogens and enhancing mutualists or plants triggering specific microbiome components. A more detailed understanding on the molecular mechanisms used by plants to interact with mutualists will lead to the development of suitable breeding targets and screening approaches. Plant breeding or genetic modification may lead in the future to the identification of plant lines ensuring improved resource efficiency, tolerance of abiotic stress and defense against pests and pathogens. Maintaining plant beneficial microbiome functions is particularly important for maintaining yield stability and to enable plant growth under (sometimes unexpected) suboptimal conditions such as drought or pathogen infestation. Although plant microbiomes have high potential to improve overall crop production worldwide, they will be particularly important for plant production under constrained conditions, where limited resources are available to irrigate, fertilize or treat plant diseases. This is the case in many parts of the world, where low input agriculture is common practice and improved germ plasm or agricultural amendments are hardly available. Making better use of plant microbiome functions will particularly support agricultural production under these conditions and foster the bio-economy of less developed countries providing microbial inoculants and establishing strain collections from local environments.","We report the earliest and the most abundant archaeobotanical assemblage of southwest Asian grain crops from Early Bronze Age Central Asia, recovered from the Chap II site in Kyrgyzstan. The archaeobotanical remains consist of thousands of cultivated grains dating to the mid-late third millennium BCE. The recovery of cereal chaff and weeds suggest local cultivation at 2000 m.a.s.l., as crops first spread to the mountains of Central Asia. The site’s inhabitants possibly cultivated two types of free-threshing wheats, glume wheats, and hulled and naked barleys. Highly compact caryopses of wheat and barley grains represent distinct morphotypes of cereals adapted to highland environments. While additional macrobotanical evidence is needed to confirm the presence of glume wheats at Chap II, the possible identification of glume wheats at Chap II may represent their most eastern distribution in Central Asia. Based on the presence of weed species, we argue that the past environment of Chap II was characterized by an open mountain landscape, where animal grazing likely took place, which may have been further modified by people irrigating agricultural fields. This research suggests that early farmers in the mountains of Central Asia cultivated compact morphotypes of southwest Asian crops during the initial eastward dispersal of agricultural technologies, which likely played a critical role in shaping montane adaptations and dynamic interaction networks between farming societies across highland and lowland cultivation zones.","AbstractA survey of integrated agriculture^aquaculture sys-tems (IAAS) was carried out in four diierentagroecologies, an irrigated and three rainfedagroecologies (drought-prone, rainfed lowland androlling land), in Northeast regionof Thailand, of tro-pical wet:dry climate. Fish culture system of IAASvaried with agroecology but not with the length offarmers’ experience in IAAS farming.

Soil biological status was evaluated by measuring microbial biomass carbon and the ratio of enzymatic activity to microbial biomass. Results were compared to those after application of inorganic fertilizer. At the end of the study, in both soil types the organic treatments had increased the organic matter and nitrogen content compared with the inorganic treatment. Total organic carbon (TOC) values in the clay were higher than in the loam. This could be related to a lower mineralization rate of soil organic matter under dry land management and/or with a protection effect, by the clay on the organic fraction. However, absolute ratios of some enzymatic activities (dehydrogenase, protease and alkaline phosphatase) by microbial biomass carbon in the clay were lower than in the loam indicating a lower rate of enzyme production by microbial biomass in the clay. In the clay soil there was a great increase in TOC, total N, microbial biomass and enzymatic activity, in all treatments, in the last crop cycle. This was mainly related to a previous legume crop. Generally organic management improved biomass and enzymatic activity in both soils. In the future further studies are required to confirm the positive long-term effect of organic fertilization on biochemical properties which maintain or improve soil quality. Additional key words: compost, organic farming, soil enzymatic activity, soil microbial biomass. Resumen Propiedades bioquimicas de dos suelos de diferente textura (franca y arcillosa) tras la adicion de dos composts diferentes en el proceso de reconversion a la agricultura ecologica","Problems concerning the environmental impact of agriculture have led to a reassessment of the conventional practices used since the 1940s, and a renewed interest by growers in organic farming began during the 1980s. Consumer interest has also increased dramatically, both for health and environmental reasons (Greene, 2000; Lampkin, 1990; Uri, 1999). Since 1996, surveys of natural food wholesalers and retailers indicated that organic produce sales had increased ≈20% yearly (Dimitri and Richman, 2000; Greene, 2001; Greene et al., 2001). Certified organic produce typically commands a higher price than conventionally grown produce. A recent survey of North Carolina-based natural food retailers and wholesalers indicated that buyers were willing to pay up to 25% more for organically grown vegetables (Estes et al., 1999). As a result of all these factors, an increasing number of growers are considering the use of, or are already employing, organic production methods. Barriers to organic certification are particularly high for greenhouse vegetable growers because virtually no technical information is available. Practices used by an experienced greenhouse organic grower to grow plants in soil have been documented (Grubinger, 1999), but specific practices for injecting fertilizer in the drip irrigation lines were not adequately described. Several grower-formulated mixtures for organic transplant production have been described (Smith, 1994), but there is little or no documentation on how to prepare organic mixes for recirculating hydroponic systems or how to add composts to soilless media used for crop production. Compost teas can be used for drip irrigation in certified organic production. However, in a manual describing the use of compost teas, Ingram and Alms (1999) describe work on compost teas as being in its infancy. The beneficial effects of compost teas were demonstrated, but most testing was conducted by trial and error. This is also true of studies using organic composts as ingredients in potting mixes and in many cases, media and waste characteristics were not reported in detail. In Germany, effluent from a fish farming unit was brought into a hydroponic cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.) and tomato greenhouse as a substitute for some of the normal fertilization (Drews and Rennert, 1992). In this study, the amount of fertilizer added to the hydroponic system was reduced by 16% for N, 14% for P, and 12% for K. Although a few examples of the successful use of organic materials in greenhouse vegetable production have been documented, it is hard to extrapolate findings to other crops and media. Broiler litter has been tested as a potting component for lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.) (Flynn et al., 1995). There are also examples where system components were well described. Tyler et al. (1993a, 1993b), Kraus et al. (2000), and Kraus and Warren (2000) conducted a series of studies of the effects of composted poultry litter on growth of containerized nursery crops. These studies described the chemical and physical characteristics of litter when combined with a pine bark substrate. However, as nursery crops grow more slowly than tomato crops, their results cannot be directly applied to a greenhouse tomato production system. Since there are no generally accepted recommendations or guidelines specifically for organic production of greenhouse tomatoes, this study was designed as a systems research project. As such, management practices for each growing season utilized information gathered from the previous growing season(s) to optimize practices for each system. The objectives of this study were to discover methods to produce healthy and productive tomato plants using flowable organic fertilizers, determine formulations for such fertilizers, and develop an organic growing medium that promotes healthy and productive tomato plants. The goal of this research project was to develop a certifiable organic regimen for growing greenhouse tomatoes that would be comparable with those grown conventionally with regard to production methods, as well as nutritional status in leaf tissue, plant development, and harvest yields.","Bananas and plantains globally the fourth important food crop, recorded wide variation in production and productivity in most of the banana growing regions. This is attributed mainly to the variety, type of planting material used, season and method of planting besides management techniques such as water and nutrients. Among all the commercial varieties of banana, owing to comparatively higher yield potential and better marketability both in domestic and export markets the Cavendish group of bananas such as Grand Naine, Williams, Robusta are preferred over other cultivars of banana. Planting sword suckers is beneficial and more ideal conventional planting material than the water suckers, butts and bits of rhizomes. However, the in-vitro banana plants of Dwarf Cavendish and Robusta are superior to conventional suckers due to their vigorous growth, early flowering (19 days) and reduced crop duration by 29 and 22 days, respectively. With reference to plant spacing and planting density which is determined by varieties grown, soil fertility status, prevailing climatic conditions etc. and maintenance of lower density of 625-1000 plants ha-1 recorded low productivity at <30t ha-1, while, high density of 5000 plants ha-1 recorded 120t ha-1. However, time taken for maturity was distinctly longer in higher densities, with 120 and 160 days Bunch grade and fruit quality are, however determined by pre-harvest bunch management practices. Influence of method of irrigation, fertilizer application and the role of nutrient elements, organic farming, INM and use of bunch sleeves on yield and fruit quality in different commercial cultivars under various conditions is discussed.","Wheat is a staple food consumed by the majority of people in the world and its production needs to be doubled to feed the growing population. On the other hand, global wheat productivity is greatly affected due to drought and low fertility of soil under arid and semi-arid regions. Application of supplementary irrigation and plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) has been suggested as sustainable measures to combat drought stress and to improve soil fertility and, hence, crop yield. This research was undertaken to study the effect of supplementary irrigation together with a combination of various PGPR on the growth and yield of two wheat cultivars, namely Sardari and Sirvan. The results of variance analysis (mean of squares) showed that the effect of irrigation, cultivar, and irrigation and biofertilizer and irrigation on height, spike length, seed/spike, and numbers of spikes/m2, 1000-seed weight, and grain yield were significant at 1% probability level. The effect of cultivar and irrigation interactions showed that the highest grain yield was obtained in a treatment with two additional irrigations in Sirvan cultivar (5015.0 kg/ha) and Sardari (4838.9 kg/ha) as compared to the 3598 kg/ha and 3598.3 kg/h grain yield in Sirvan and Sardari cultivars with similar treatment, but without irrigation, i.e., dryland farming. Drought conditions significantly affected the wheat grain yield while supplementary irrigation resulted in 39.38% and 34.48% higher yields in Sirvan and Sardari cultivars.","BOČEK, S., SALAŠ, P., SASKOVÁ, H., MOKRIČKOVÁ, J.: Eff ect of Alginure® (seaweed extract), MycoSin®VIN (sulfuric clay) and Polyversum® (Pythium oligandrum Drechs.) on yield and disease control in organic strawberries. Acta univ. agric. et silvic. Mendel. Brun., 2012, LX, No. 8, pp. 19–28 In 2011 and 2012 three commercial products Alginure® (seaweed extract), Myco-Sin® VIN (sulfuric acid clay with yeast and plant extracts) and Polyversum® (spores of Pythium oligandrum) were tested in fi eld experiment with strawberry cv. ‘Induka’ under the conditions of organic growing system. The aim of the study was to determine the eff ect of the preparations on yield, fruit quality and diseases control. The preparations were applied fi ve times during fl owering. We assessed total yield, marketable and unmarketable yields, average fruit weight, grey mould incidence on fruits caused by Botrytis cinerea and leaf spot severity caused by Mycosphaerella fragariae. Effi cacy (%) of preparations was calculated. Preparations did not show positive eff ect on yields parameters. Total and marketable yields were not signifi cantly diff erent to untreated control in both years. Nevertheless considerable increase of yields from 2011 to 2012 was observed in strawberries treated by biofungicide Polyversum®. Preparations did not signifi cantly reduce the incidence of grey mould. Alginure® showed the best results by effi cacy 39.6 % and 57.4 %, respectively. All preparations provided very low, less than 10% effi cacy to control leaf spot severity. organic strawberry, Polyversum®, Alginure®, Myco-Sin®VIN, Botrytis cinerea Organic fruit growing represents dynamically developing sector experiencing remarkable growth rates since the middle 1990’s in Europe (Weibel et al., 2004). Organic growers overcome the restrictions of use synthetic pesticides by selection suitable resistant varieties but they may meet the problem to sell a new product (variety) on the market. Another problem is the possibility of development of a new pest or pathogen populations overcoming existing resistance. New races of Venturia inaequalis causing apple scab in resistant varieties carrying Rvi6 and Rvi7 genes represent a typical example (Gessler et al., 2006). Therefore besides of newly bred resistant cultivars, organic growers need innovative cultivation technologies to ensure good yield and high quality of production. One approach is low input management using pests and disease selfregulatory mechanisms by supporting natural benefi cial organisms in orchards (Laer, 2010; Weibel et al., 2010). However this management is still somewhat uncertain in intensive fruit plantations. Therefore artifi cial introduction and application of benefi cial organisms (bioagens) are more widely used. Success of organic farming is highly encouraged by advances in the fi eld of knowledge about plant defence mechanism which leads to using biocontrol agents and natural plant elicitors to enhance natural plant defence responses (AmilRuiz et al., 2011). Induced systemic resistance is a phenomenon whereby resistance to pathogen 20 S. Boček, P. Salaš, H. Sasková, J. Mokričková is systematically induced by local infection or treatment with microbial components or products or by a diverse group of structurally unrelated organic and inorganic compounds (Kuć, 2001). In order to reduce or replace copper fungicides not only in organic production, sulfuric clays are tested to control pathogens (Dorn et al., 2007; Michelante and Haine, 2004). In organic growing sulfuric clays are successfully introduced into the protection strategies, mainly in apples (Jamar and Lateur, 2007; Jamar et al., 2010; Kelderer et al., 2010; Kunz et al., 2011; Falta and Vávra, 2010). Natural compounds used as elicitors of induced systemic resistance off er new prospects for controlling diseases in organic production (Lateur, 2002; Kaufmann et al., 2009). Seaweed extracts are tested in horticultural crops not only for control diseses (Washington et al., 1999; Prokkola et al., 2007; Loyola and Muñoz, 2009; Parikka et al., 2009; Malusa et al., 2010) but also as biostimulants and fertilizers (Crouch et al., 1993; Paszt et al., 2011; Malusa et al., 2012). Strawberry (Fragaria × grandifl ora Ehr.) is a popular horticultural crop widely grown in organic system, although it can be challenged with many pests and pathogens. Grey mould caused by the fungus Botrytis cinerea Pers. ex Fr. is one of the most important disease of strawberries in humid climate. Therefore there is an eff ort to fi nd out protection methods involving biological control using fungal or bacterial microorganisms (Peng and Sutton, 1991; Swadling and Jeff ries, 1996; Adikaram et al., 2002; Donmez et al., 2011). Mycoparasitic fungus Pythium oligandrum Drechs. can be used for biological control in a wide spectrum of crops by its ability to attack fungal plant pathogens (Brožová, 2002) and to induce systemic resistance due to elicitinlike proteins POD-1, POD-2, POS-1 and oligandrin (Masunaka et al., 2010). Several studies proved oligandrin to be eff ective in pathogen control in strawberries and other horticultural crops (Picard et al. 2000; Benhamou et al., 2001; Mohamed et al., 2007; Wang et al., 2011). Lou et al. (2011) explain the ability of oligandrin to induce resistance against Botrytis cinerea in tomatoes by eliciting production of PR-2a and PR-3a (genes related to pathogenesis) and by increasing of defence enzymes POD, PPO and PAL in host plant. This work is the output of a pilot project focused on the development of methods for commercial organic strawberry growing in the Czech Republic, where actually only hobby growers produce strawberries without chemical treatment. The aim of the present study was to test several bio preparations to fi nd out their diseases control eff ectiveness and to assess their impact on yield and quality variables. The fi eld experiment was conducted to prove effi cacy of commercial plant protective agents Alginure® (seaweed extract), Myco-Sin®VIN (clay mineral with horsetail extract) and Polyversum® (spores of Pythium oligandrum) on yield, fruit quality and health status of strawberry cv. ‘Induka’ under the organic system conditions. MATERIALS AND METHODS The experiment was carried out in fi elds of Faculty of Horticulture in Lednice (Mendel University in Brno). The locality is situated in Southern Moravia and is characterized by silty soils, altitude 179 m, mean year temperature 9 °C, mean year precipitation 517 mm. The soil was prepared two years according to the rules of organic agriculture using three kinds of green manure every year – phacelia, white mustard and mixture of fi eld pea with oat, respectively. The experiment was established in the middle of September 2010 with seedlings of cv. ‘Induka’ (propagation station SEMPRA Turnov, Ltd., Czech Republic). Seedlings were planted in double row system on ridges covered by black polypropylene plastic mulch (nonwoven fabric). The distance of double rows was 0.8 m, spacing of plants 0.35 × 0.25 m. Drop irrigation was installed above the plastic mulch immediately a er planting. All agrotechnical operations were carried out according to the principles of organic agriculture. During the growing period the plantation was kept free of weeds by hand. In order to limit weed development, inter-rows were mulched with approximately 40 mm thick layer of wheat straw in the beginning of April in 2011 and 2012, respectively. The trials comprised of four treatments with three replicates with 20 plants (totally 60 plants). A randomised complete block design was used. Treatments were following.","Legumes crops play significant roles both in human diets and agriculture, and contribute to sustainable farming. In this study, we evaluated both some quality traits and yield of four landraces (Cegliese, Iambola, San Francesco, and FV5) of faba bean (Vicia faba L. var. major Harz) for fresh consumption in order to assess and distinguish the landraces also in comparison with two commercial varieties (Aguadulce supersimonia and Extra-early purple) by using a crop system without irrigation. Independently of the genotype, we obtained the same pods yield (1794 g m−2) without affecting the seed size. All genotypes can be considered a good source of vitamin C, although Extra-early purple and San Francesco reveal the highest content (703 and 646 mg 100 g−1 fresh weight—FW, respectively). Cegliese showed the highest L-dopa content (10.14 mg 100 g−1 FW), suggesting its use as a natural rich source of L-dopa (dopamine precursor used for Parkinson’s disease treatment) instead of using synthesized L-dopa. In conclusion, this study highlight interesting quality traits of faba bean when consumed as fresh vegetables, suggesting its positive role on human health and the possibility of its production by using local horticultural systems that are skilled in optimizing resource utilization.","The Circular Economy concept implies the re-design of existing production systems in agriculture, by promoting agricultural waste recycling. In an organic zucchini—lettuce rotation, two different agroecological tools were considered: biofertilizer and presence or absence of green manure (GM+ and GM−). In particular, we compared: (i) anaerobic digestate from cattle manure, co-composted with vegetable wastes, with the presence of GM (AD GM+); (ii) olive pomace compost, re-composted, with the presence of GM (OWC GM+); (iii) municipal waste compost with GM (MWC GM+); (iv) municipal waste compost without GM (MWC GM−). These materials were tested with a commercial organic fertilizer without GM (COF GM−) as a positive control. The objectives were: (i) assessing the environmental sustainability of biofertilizers through carbon footprint analysis by greenhouse gas—GHG—emissions; (ii) evaluating the agronomic performance on the vegetable rotation, by energy output assessment. The total carbon emissions of biofertilizers production was 63.9 and 67.0 kg of CO2 eq Mg−1 for AD and OWC, respectively. The co-composting and re-composting processes emitted 31.4 and 8.4 kg CO2 per Mg of compost, respectively. In AD the ventilation phase of composting accounted for 37.2% of total emissions. The total CO2 emission values for the two-crop cycles were the highest in COF GM− and the lowest in OWC GM+, due to different fertilizer sources. On the average of the treatments, the input that induced the highest CO2 emission was irrigation (37.9%). The energy output assessment for zucchini and lettuce highlighted similar performance for all the treatments. Our findings demonstrated the validity of the tested processes to recycle agro-industrial wastes, and the potential of agroecological practices (GM) to mitigate GHG emissions.","Abstract. This study was undertaken to identify factors in Australian cotton farming systems that influence yield and fibre quality of cotton and how these have changed with time after the wide adoption of Bollgard II® cultivars (containing the proteins Cry1Ac and Cry2Ab, providing easier control of Helicoverpa spp.) in the 2003–04 season. Data from Australian commercial cotton variety trials conducted from 2004 to 2011 were used to link management inputs, yield, and fibre quality. Restricted (residual) maximum likelihood (REML) and regression analyses were used to determine which factors had a significant effect on yield and fibre quality. Results showed that lint yield was significantly influenced by cultivar and growing region, and the interaction between region and the amount of applied nitrogen and phosphorus (kg ha–1), plant stand (plants ha–1), in-crop rainfall (mm) and the number of irrigations, season length (days), and days to defoliation. Generally, the same factors also influenced fibre quality. Regression analysis captured 41, 71, 50, 30, and 36% of the variability in lint yield, fibre length, micronaire, fibre strength, and trash, respectively, for irrigated systems. For dryland systems the variability captured was 97, 87, 77 80, and 78%, respectively. Changes in cotton farming systems from 2004 to 2011 have occurred with applied nitrogen fertiliser increasing under irrigation and decreasing under dryland systems. However, phosphorus fertiliser use has remained steady under irrigated and decreased under dryland systems, and the number of insect sprayings has decreased under both systems. Under irrigated systems, lint yield, fibre length, and trash levels increased while micronaire and fibre strength decreased. Under dryland systems, lint yield decreased while micronaire, fibre length, strength, and trash levels increased. All fibre quality parameters satisfied criteria that would not incur a penalty. The results considering which factors are the most important and which are of lesser importance provide some insight to changes in management in both irrigated and dryland systems and the effect on lint yield and fibre quality and provide some basis for future investment in research and development and extension to the Australian cotton industry.","Several studies have quantified the energy consumption associated with crop production in various countries. However, these studies have not compared the energy consumption from a broad range of farming practices currently in practice, such as zero tillage, conventional tillage and irrigated farming systems. This study examines direct on-farm energy use for high value grain crops grown under different farming practices in Australia. Grain farming processes are identified and “typical” farming operation data are collected from several sources, including published and unpublished literature, as well as expert interviews. The direct on-farm energy uses are assessed for 27 scenarios, including three high value grain crops―wheat, barley and sorghum―for three regions (Northern, Southern and Western Australia) under three farming conditions with both dryland (both for conventional and zero-tillage) and irrigated conditions. It is found that energy requirement for farming operations is directly related to the intensity and frequency of farming operations, which in turn is related to tillage practices, soil types, irrigation systems, local climate, and crop types. Among the three studied regions, Western Australia requires less direct on-farm energy for each crop, mainly due to the easily workable sandy soils and adoption of zero tillage systems. In irrigated crops, irrigation energy remains a major contributor to the total on-farm energy demand, accounting for up to 85% of total energy use.","A field research was carried out in the years of 2005, 2006 and 2007 in order to determine the effect of irrigation and water stress imposed at different growth stages on quantity and quality traits of Virginia tobacco plants. A randomized complete block design with four treatments and three replications was applied at the Rasht tobacco research station. Treatments were: no irrigation (dryland farming) as the complete water stress (WS 0 ), water stress till the end of flower bud forming stage (WS 1 ), water stress till the end of flowering stage (WS 2 ) and full irrigation (WS 3 ) as control in each cropping season. The combined analysis of variance showed that the effect of water stress on all the traits related to yield, quality traits and all the traits related to yield components except number of leaves, was significant (P < 0.01). The interaction between year and water stress showed that the treatment of WS 0 in all three experimental years significantly (P < 0.05) affected the fresh and dry leaf yield, plant height and sugar and nicotine percentage. The comparison of means of three years (average of three years) also revealed that the treatment of WS 0 significantly (P < 0.05) affected all of the traits which were related to tobacco quantity and quality except for the number of leaves. Moreover, the level of water productivity in recognition of each water volume unit for three experimental years for the treatments of WS 1 , WS 2 and WS 3 were 1.223, 0.873 and 0.594 kg/m 3 , respectively, in the case of average dry leaf yield. Consequently, the results indicate that with optimizing irrigation application we can reach the higher level of productivity.",14.0183268294341,Crop Yield Optimization

Modern agricultural techniques increasingly use the well-known and superior approach of managing a farm known as “smart farming”. Utilizing a variety of information and agricultural technologies, crops are observed for their general health and productivity. This requires monitoring the condition of field crops and looking at many other indicators. The goal of smart agriculture is to reduce the amount of money spent on agricultural inputs while keeping the quality of the final product constant. The Internet of Things (IoT) has made smart agriculture possible through data collection and storage techniques. For example, modern irrigation systems use effective sensor networks to collect field data for the best plant irrigation. Smart agriculture will become more susceptible to cyber-attacks as its reliance on the IoT ecosystem grows, because IoT networks have a large number of nodes but limited resources, which makes security a difficult issue. Hence, it is crucial to have an intrusion detection system (IDS) that can address such challenges. In this manuscript, an IoT-based privacy-preserving anomaly detection model for smart agriculture has been proposed. The motivation behind this work is twofold. Firstly, ensuring data privacy in IoT-based agriculture is of the utmost importance due to the large volumes of sensitive information collected by IoT devices, including on environmental conditions, crop health, and resource utilization data. Secondly, the timely detection of anomalies in smart agriculture systems is critical to enable proactive interventions, such as preventing crop damage, optimizing resource allocation, and ensuring sustainable farming practices. In this paper, we propose a privacy-encoding-based enhanced deep learning framework for the difficulty of data encryption and intrusion detection. In terms of data encoding, a novel method of a sparse capsule-auto encoder (SCAE) is proposed along with feature selection, feature mapping, and feature normalization. An SCAE is used to convert information into a new encrypted format in order to prevent deduction attacks. An attention-based gated recurrent unit neural network model is proposed to detect the intrusion. An AGRU is an advanced version of a GRU which is enhanced by an attention mechanism. In the results section, the proposed model is compared with existing deep learning models using two public datasets. Parameters such as recall, precision, accuracy, and F1-score are considered. The proposed model has accuracy, recall, precision, and F1-score of 99.9%, 99.7%, 99.9%, and 99.8%, respectively. The proposed method is compared using a variety of machine learning techniques such as the deep neural network (DNN), convolutional neural network (CNN), recurrent neural network (RNN), and long short-term memory (LSTM).","The agricultural industry is getting more data-centric and requires precise, more advanced data and technologies than before, despite being familiar with agricultural processes.

Farm productivity can be increased by understanding and forecasting crop performance in a variety of environmental conditions. Crop recommendation is currently based on data collected in field-based agricultural studies that capture crop performance under a variety of conditions (e.g., soil quality and environmental conditions). However, crop performance data collection is currently slow, as such crop studies are often undertaken in remote and distributed locations, and such data are typically collected manually. Furthermore, the quality of manually collected crop performance data is very low, because it does not take into account earlier conditions that have not been observed by the human operators but is essential to filter out collected data that will lead to invalid conclusions (e.g., solar radiation readings in the afternoon after even a short rain or overcast in the morning are invalid, and should not be used in assessing crop performance). Emerging Internet of Things (IoT) technologies, such as IoT devices (e.g., wireless sensor networks, network-connected weather stations, cameras, and smart phones) can be used to collate vast amount of environmental and crop performance data, ranging from time series data from sensors, to spatial data from cameras, to human observations collected and recorded via mobile smart phone applications. Such data can then be analysed to filter out invalid data and compute personalised crop recommendations for any specific farm. In this paper, we present the design of SmartFarmNet, an IoT-based platform that can automate the collection of environmental, soil, fertilisation, and irrigation data; automatically correlate such data and filter-out invalid data from the perspective of assessing crop performance; and compute crop forecasts and personalised crop recommendations for any particular farm. SmartFarmNet can integrate virtually any IoT device, including commercially available sensors, cameras, weather stations, etc., and store their data in the cloud for performance analysis and recommendations. An evaluation of the SmartFarmNet platform and our experiences and lessons learnt in developing this system concludes the paper. SmartFarmNet is the first and currently largest system in the world (in terms of the number of sensors attached, crops assessed, and users it supports) that provides crop performance analysis and recommendations.","Smart agriculture techniques have recently seen widespread interest by farmers.
