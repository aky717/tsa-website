This process can be accentuated by climate change, excessive use of groundwater (mainly if close to the sea), increasing use of low-quality water in irrigation, and massive introduction of irrigation associated with intensive farming. Excessive soil salinity reduces the productivity of many agricultural crops, including most vegetables, which are particularly sensitive throughout the ontogeny of the plant. The salinity threshold (ECt) of the majority of vegetable crops is low (ranging from 1 to 2.5 dS m−1 in saturated soil extracts) and vegetable salt tolerance decreases when saline water is used for irrigation. The objective of this review is to discuss the effects of salinity on vegetable growth and how management practices (irrigation, drainage, and fertilization) can prevent soil and water salinization and mitigate the adverse effects of salinity.",https://www.mdpi.com/2311-7524/3/2/30/pdf?version=1493884567,

The introduction of new farming techniques in the past century (e.g., during the Green Revolution) has helped agriculture keep pace with growing demands for food and other agricultural products. However, further increases in food demand, a growing population, and rising income levels are likely to put additional strain on natural resources. With growing recognition of the negative impacts of agriculture on the environment, new techniques and approaches should be able to meet future food demands while maintaining or reducing the environmental footprint of agriculture. Emerging technologies, such as geospatial technologies, Internet of Things (IoT), Big Data analysis, and artificial intelligence (AI), could be utilized to make informed management decisions aimed to increase crop production. Precision agriculture (PA) entails the application of a suite of such technologies to optimize agricultural inputs to increase agricultural production and reduce input losses. Use of remote sensing technologies for PA has increased rapidly during the past few decades. The unprecedented availability of high resolution (spatial, spectral and temporal) satellite images has promoted the use of remote sensing in many PA applications, including crop monitoring, irrigation management, nutrient application, disease and pest management, and yield prediction. In this paper, we provide an overview of remote sensing systems, techniques, and vegetation indices along with their recent (2015–2020) applications in PA. Remote-sensing-based PA technologies such as variable fertilizer rate application technology in Green Seeker and Crop Circle have already been incorporated in commercial agriculture. Use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has increased tremendously during the last decade due to their cost-effectiveness and flexibility in obtaining the high-resolution (cm-scale) images needed for PA applications. At the same time, the availability of a large amount of satellite data has prompted researchers to explore advanced data storage and processing techniques such as cloud computing and machine learning. Given the complexity of image processing and the amount of technical knowledge and expertise needed, it is critical to explore and develop a simple yet reliable workflow for the real-time application of remote sensing in PA. Development of accurate yet easy to use, user-friendly systems is likely to result in broader adoption of remote sensing technologies in commercial and non-commercial PA applications.",https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/12/19/3136/pdf?version=1602214473,

Climate change is a global environmental threat to all economic sectors, particularly the agricultural sector. Pakistan is one of the countries negatively affected by climate change due to its high exposure to extreme events and low adaptive capacity. In Pakistan, farmers are the primary stakeholders in agriculture and are more at risk due to climate vulnerability. Based on farm household data from 450 households collected from three districts in three agroecological zones in the Punjab province of Pakistan, this study examines how farmers perceive climate change and how they adapt their farming in response to perceived changes in climate. The results demonstrate that awareness of climate change is widespread throughout the area, and farm households make adjustments to adapt their agriculture in response to climatic change. Overall 58% of the farm households adapted their farming to climate change. Changing crop varieties, changing planting dates, planting of shade trees and changing fertilizers were the main adaptation methods implemented by farm households in the study area. The results from the binary logistic model reveal that education, farm experience, household size, land area, tenancy status, ownership of a tube well, access to market information, information on weather forecasting and agricultural extension services all influence farmers' choices of adaptation measures. The results also indicate that adaptation to climate change is constrained by several factors such as lack of information, lack of money, resource constraints and shortage of irrigation water in the study area. Findings of the study suggest the need for greater investment in farmer education and improved institutional setup for climate change adaptation to improve farmers' wellbeing.",https://esd.copernicus.org/articles/6/225/2015/esd-6-225-2015.pdf,

Farm productivity can be increased by understanding and forecasting crop performance in a variety of environmental conditions. Crop recommendation is currently based on data collected in field-based agricultural studies that capture crop performance under a variety of conditions (e.g., soil quality and environmental conditions). However, crop performance data collection is currently slow, as such crop studies are often undertaken in remote and distributed locations, and such data are typically collected manually. Furthermore, the quality of manually collected crop performance data is very low, because it does not take into account earlier conditions that have not been observed by the human operators but is essential to filter out collected data that will lead to invalid conclusions (e.g., solar radiation readings in the afternoon after even a short rain or overcast in the morning are invalid, and should not be used in assessing crop performance). Emerging Internet of Things (IoT) technologies, such as IoT devices (e.g., wireless sensor networks, network-connected weather stations, cameras, and smart phones) can be used to collate vast amount of environmental and crop performance data, ranging from time series data from sensors, to spatial data from cameras, to human observations collected and recorded via mobile smart phone applications. Such data can then be analysed to filter out invalid data and compute personalised crop recommendations for any specific farm. In this paper, we present the design of SmartFarmNet, an IoT-based platform that can automate the collection of environmental, soil, fertilisation, and irrigation data; automatically correlate such data and filter-out invalid data from the perspective of assessing crop performance; and compute crop forecasts and personalised crop recommendations for any particular farm. SmartFarmNet can integrate virtually any IoT device, including commercially available sensors, cameras, weather stations, etc., and store their data in the cloud for performance analysis and recommendations. An evaluation of the SmartFarmNet platform and our experiences and lessons learnt in developing this system concludes the paper. SmartFarmNet is the first and currently largest system in the world (in terms of the number of sensors attached, crops assessed, and users it supports) that provides crop performance analysis and recommendations.",https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/16/11/1884/pdf?version=1478784563,

Increasing crop production by preserving environment and mitigating climate change should thus be the main goal of today’s agriculture. Conventional farming is characterized by use of high-yielding varieties, irrigation water, chemical fertilizers and synthetic pesticides to increase yields. However, due to either over- or misuse of chemical fertilizers or pesticides in many agro-ecosystems, such farming is often blamed for land degradation and environmental pollution and for adversely affecting the health of humans, plants, animals and aquatic ecosystems. Of all inputs required for increased agricultural production, nutrients are considered to be the most important ones. Organic farming, with use of organic sources of nutrients, is proposed as a sustainable strategy for producing safe, healthy and cheaper food and for restoring soil fertility and mitigating climate change. However, there are several myths and controversies surrounding the use of organic versus inorganic sources of nutrients. The objectives of this paper are: (i) to clarify some of the myths or misconceptions about organic versus inorganic sources of nutrients and (ii) to propose alternative solutions to increase on-farm biomass production for use as organic inputs for improving soil fertility and increasing crop yields. Common myths identified by this review include that organic materials/fertilizers can: (i) supply all required macro- and micro-nutrients for plants; (ii) improve physical, chemical and microbiological properties of soils; (iii) be applied universally on all soils; (iv) always produce quality products; (v) be cheaper and affordable; and (vi) build-up of large amount of soil organic matter. Other related myths are: “legumes can use entire amount of N2 fixed from atmosphere” and “bio-fertilizers increase nutrient content of soil.” Common myths regarding chemical fertilizers are that they: (i) are not easily available and affordable, (ii) degrade land, (iii) pollute environment and (iv) adversely affect health of humans, animals and agro-ecosystems. The review reveals that, except in some cases where higher yields (and higher profits) can be found from organic farming, their yields are generally 20–50% lower than that from conventional farming. The paper demonstrates that considering the current organic sources of nutrients in the developing countries, organic nutrients alone are not enough to increase crop yields to meet global food demand and that nutrients from inorganic and organic sources should preferably be applied at 75:25 ratio. The review identifies a new and alternative concept of Evergreen Agriculture (an extension of Agroforestry System), which has potential to supply organic nutrients in much higher amounts, improve on-farm soil fertility and meet nutrient demand of high-yielding crops, sequester carbon and mitigate greenhouse gas emissions, provide fodder for livestock and fuelwood for farmers and has potential to meet global food demand. Evergreen Agriculture has been widely adapted by tens of millions of farmers in several African countries and the review proposes for evaluation and scaling-up of such technology in Asian and Latin American countries too.",https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4395/8/10/214/pdf?version=1538580409,

On the other hand, intercropping systems, also known as mixed cropping or polyculture, a traditional farming practice with diversified crop cultivation, uses comparatively low inputs and improves the quality of the agro-ecosystem. Intensification of crops can be done spatially and temporally by the adoption of the intercropping system targeting future need. Intercropping ensures multiple benefits like enhancement of yield, environmental security, production sustainability and greater ecosystem services. In intercropping, two or more crop species are grown concurrently as they coexist for a significant part of the crop cycle and interact among themselves and agro-ecosystems. Legumes as component crops in the intercropping system play versatile roles like biological N fixation and soil quality improvement, additional yield output including protein yield, and creation of functional diversity. But growing two or more crops together requires additional care and management for the creation of less competition among the crop species and efficient utilization of natural resources.

Climate change in Australia is expected to influence crop growing conditions through direct increases in elevated carbon dioxide (CO2) and average temperature, and through increases in the variability of climate, with potential to increase the occurrence of abiotic stresses such as heat, drought, waterlogging, and salinity. Associated effects of climate change and higher CO2 concentrations include impacts on the water-use efficiency of dryland and irrigated crop production, and potential effects on biosecurity, production, and quality of product via impacts on endemic and introduced pests and diseases, and tolerance to these challenges. Direct adaptation to these changes can occur through changes in crop, farm, and value-chain management and via economically driven, geographic shifts where different production systems operate. Within specific crops, a longer term adaptation is the breeding of new varieties that have an improved performance in ‘future’ growing conditions compared with existing varieties. In crops, breeding is an appropriate adaptation response where it complements management changes, or when the required management changes are too expensive or impractical. Breeding requires the assessment of genetic diversity for adaptation, and the selection and recombining of genetic resources into new varieties for production systems for projected future climate and atmospheric conditions. As in the past, an essential priority entering into a ‘climate-changed’ era will be breeding for resistance or tolerance to the effects of existing and new pests and diseases. Hence, research on the potential incidence and intensity of biotic stresses, and the opportunities for breeding solutions, is essential to prioritise investment, as the consequences could be catastrophic. The values of breeding activities to adapt to the five major abiotic effects of climate change (heat, drought, waterlogging, salinity, and elevated CO2) are more difficult to rank, and vary with species and production area, with impacts on both yield and quality of product. Although there is a high likelihood of future increases in atmospheric CO2 concentrations and temperatures across Australia, there is uncertainty about the direction and magnitude of rainfall change, particularly in the northern farming regions. Consequently, the clearest opportunities for ‘in-situ’ genetic gains for abiotic stresses are in developing better adaptation to higher temperatures (e.g. control of phenological stage durations, and tolerance to stress) and, for C3 species, in exploiting the (relatively small) fertilisation effects of elevated CO2. For most cultivated plant species, it remains to be demonstrated how much genetic variation exists for these traits and what value can be delivered via commercial varieties. Biotechnology-based breeding technologies (marker-assisted breeding and genetic modification) will be essential to accelerate genetic gain, but their application requires additional investment in the understanding, genetic characterisation, and phenotyping of complex adaptive traits for climate-change conditions.",https://www.publish.csiro.au/cp/pdf/CP11303,

In the area of agriculture production, IoT-based WSN has been used to observe the yields condition and automate agriculture precision using various sensors. These sensors are deployed in the agricultural environment to improve production yields through intelligent farming decisions and obtain information regarding crops, plants, temperature measurement, humidity, and irrigation systems. However, sensors have limited resources concerning processing, energy, transmitting, and memory capabilities that can negatively impact agriculture production. Besides efficiency, the protection and security of these IoT-based agricultural sensors are also important from malicious adversaries. In this article, we proposed an IoT-based WSN framework as an application to smart agriculture comprising different design levels. Firstly, agricultural sensors capture relevant data and determine a set of cluster heads based on multi-criteria decision function. Additionally, the strength of the signals on the transmission links is measured while using signal to noise ratio (SNR) to achieve consistent and efficient data transmissions. Secondly, security is provided for data transmission from agricultural sensors towards base stations (BS) while using the recurrence of the linear congruential generator. The simulated results proved that the proposed framework significantly enhanced the communication performance as an average of 13.5% in the network throughput, 38.5% in the packets drop ratio, 13.5% in the network latency, 16% in the energy consumption, and 26% in the routing overheads for smart agriculture, as compared to other solutions.",https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/20/7/2081/pdf?version=1586395780,

This study reviews existing and available literature on farmers’ perceptions and adaptations to climate change in sub-Sahara Africa. It is evident that the majority of farmers in sub-Sahara Africa are aware of warmer temperatures and changes in precipitation patterns. To respond to these changes, farmers have adopted crop diversification, planting different crop varieties, changing planting and harvesting dates to correspond to the changing pattern of precipitation, irrigation, planting tree crops,water and soil conservation techniques, and switching to non-farm income activities. Years of farming experience, household size, years of education, access to credit facilities, access to extension services and off-farm income are among the signicant determinants of adopting climate change adaptation measures. To enable sub-Sahara African farmers to develop more effective climate change adaptationstrategies,there is the need for African governments to support farmers by providing the necessary resources such as credit, information and extension workers to train farmers on climate change adaptation strategies and technologies, and investing in climate resilient projects like, improving on existing or building new water infrastructure and building climate change monitoring and reporting stations.",https://ccsenet.org/journal/index.php/jas/article/download/23791/15889,

Surprisingly little is known about their impacts on soil microbial functional diversity, and especially so in irrigated Mediterranean ecosystems. In long-term experimental plots at the West Side Research and Extension Center in California’s Central Valley, we characterized soil microbial communities in the presence or absence of physical disturbance due to tillage, in the presence or absence of cover crops, and at three depths: 0–5, 5–15 and 15–30 cm. This characterization included qPCR for bacterial and archaeal abundances, DNA sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene, and phylogenetic estimation of two ecologically important microbial traits (rRNA gene copy number and genome size). Total (bacterial + archaeal) diversity was higher in no-till than standard till; diversity increased with depth in no-till but decreased with depth in standard till. Total bacterial numbers were higher in cover cropped plots at all depths, while no-till treatments showed higher numbers in 0–5 cm but lower numbers at lower depths compared to standard tillage. Trait estimates suggested that different farming practices and depths favored distinctly different microbial life strategies. Tillage in the absence of cover crops shifted microbial communities towards fast growing competitors, while no-till shifted them toward slow growing stress tolerators. Across all treatment combinations, increasing depth resulted in a shift towards stress tolerators. Cover crops shifted the communities towards ruderals–organisms with wider metabolic capacities and moderate rates of growth. Overall, our results are consistent with decreasing nutrient availability with soil depth and under no-till treatments, bursts of nutrient availability and niche homogenization under standard tillage, and increases in C supply and variety provided by cover crops. Understanding how agricultural practices shift microbial abundance, diversity and life strategies, such as presented here, can assist with designing farming systems that can support high yields, while enhancing C sequestration and increasing resilience to climate change.",https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0192953&type=printable,

Various climate-driven extremes, i.e., drought, heat waves, erratic and intense rainfall patterns, storms, floods, and emerging insect pests have adversely affected the livelihood of the farmers. Future climatic predictions showed a significant increase in temperature, and erratic rainfall with higher intensity while variability exists in climatic patterns for climate extremes prediction. For mid-century (2040–2069), it is projected that there will be a rise of 2.8°C in maximum temperature and a 2.2°C in minimum temperature in Pakistan. To respond to the adverse effects of climate change scenarios, there is a need to optimize the climate-smart and resilient agricultural practices and technology for sustainable productivity. Therefore, a case study was carried out to quantify climate change effects on rice and wheat crops and to develop adaptation strategies for the rice-wheat cropping system during the mid-century (2040–2069) as these two crops have significant contributions to food production. For the quantification of adverse impacts of climate change in farmer fields, a multidisciplinary approach consisted of five climate models (GCMs), two crop models (DSSAT and APSIM) and an economic model [Trade-off Analysis, Minimum Data Model Approach (TOAMD)] was used in this case study. DSSAT predicted that there would be a yield reduction of 15.2% in rice and 14.1% in wheat and APSIM showed that there would be a yield reduction of 17.2% in rice and 12% in wheat. Adaptation technology, by modification in crop management like sowing time and density, nitrogen, and irrigation application have the potential to enhance the overall productivity and profitability of the rice-wheat cropping system under climate change scenarios. Moreover, this paper reviews current literature regarding adverse climate change impacts on agricultural productivity, associated main issues, challenges, and opportunities for sustainable productivity of agriculture to ensure food security in Asia. Flowing opportunities such as altering sowing time and planting density of crops, crop rotation with legumes, agroforestry, mixed livestock systems, climate resilient plants, livestock and fish breeds, farming of monogastric livestock, early warning systems and decision support systems, carbon sequestration, climate, water, energy, and soil smart technologies, and promotion of biodiversity have the potential to reduce the negative effects of climate change.",https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpls.2022.925548/pdf,

Rice-fallow cropland areas are those areas where rice is grown during the kharif growing season (June–October), followed by a fallow during the rabi season (November–February). These cropland areas are not suitable for growing rabi-season rice due to their high water needs, but are suitable for a short -season (≤3 months), low water-consuming grain legumes such as chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.), black gram, green gram, and lentils. Intensification (double-cropping) in this manner can improve smallholder farmer’s incomes and soil health via rich nitrogen-fixation legume crops as well as address food security challenges of ballooning populations without having to expand croplands. Several grain legumes, primarily chickpea, are increasingly grown across Asia as a source of income for smallholder farmers and at the same time providing rich and cheap source of protein that can improve the nutritional quality of diets in the region. The suitability of rainfed and irrigated rice-fallow croplands for grain legume cultivation across South Asia were defined by these identifiers: (a) rice crop is grown during the primary (kharif) crop growing season or during the north-west monsoon season (June–October); (b) same croplands are left fallow during the second (rabi) season or during the south-east monsoon season (November–February); and (c) ability to support low water-consuming, short-growing season (≤3 months) grain legumes (chickpea, black gram, green gram, and lentils) during rabi season. Existing irrigated or rainfed crops such as rice or wheat that were grown during kharif were not considered suitable for growing during the rabi season, because the moisture/water demand of these crops is too high. The study established cropland classes based on the every 16-day 250 m normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) time series for one year (June 2010–May 2011) of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data, using spectral matching techniques (SMTs), and extensive field knowledge. Map accuracy was evaluated based on independent ground survey data as well as compared with available sub-national level statistics. The producers’ and users’ accuracies of the cropland fallow classes were between 75% and 82%. The overall accuracy and the kappa coefficient estimated for rice classes were 82% and 0.79, respectively. The analysis estimated approximately 22.3 Mha of suitable rice-fallow areas in South Asia, with 88.3% in India, 0.5% in Pakistan, 1.1% in Sri Lanka, 8.7% in Bangladesh, 1.4% in Nepal, and 0.02% in Bhutan.

Recycled, acid-free paper. Irrigated agriculture is not exactly the sexiest subject under the sun; in fact, sometimes it can be downright boring. But irrigation is an important part of the environmental history of the American West, and as such, it has not lacked attention from scholars. However, while much important research has been done on irrigated agriculture in California, very little has been written on irrigation in the Pacific Northwest, a region that, like the Golden State, has benefited immensely from private and public agricultural development of arid lands. Mark Fiege, a professor of history at Colorado State University, has helped fill this historiographic gap with Irrigated Eden, an environmental history of irrigation in Idaho's Snake River Valley. He has taken what could be a deadly dull topic and turned it into a fascinating tale of the subtle and often unforeseen interactions between humans and the non-human world during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Written in a lively style with a strong narrative focus throughout, Irrigated Eden is certainly one of the finest histories of Northwest agriculture on the shelves. Chapter one sets the stage for the later chapters, introducing readers to the Snake River Valley and to the culture and technology of irrigation. The author also introduces his primary argument here, an argument that he sums up quite nicely in the conclusion: In attempting to change and control a dynamic environment, irrigators themselves changed. Culture and nature, social system and natural system, shaped each other: the result was a hybrid landscape and a hybrid social order (p. 207).

Rice required far more labor than dryland crops like wheat, and rice’s irrigation networks forced farmers to coordinate water use. To deal with these demands, rice villages developed strong norms for labor exchange. Using China as a natural test case, we compare nearby provinces that differ in rice and wheat, but share the same ethnicity, religion, and national government. In survey data from over 11,000 Chinese citizens, rice-farming provinces report tighter norms than traditionally wheat-growing provinces. Rice also predicts tight norms around the world. These data suggest that China’s agricultural past still shapes cultural differences in the modern day—and perhaps explain why East Asia has tighter social norms than the wheat-growing West. Data recently published in PNAS mapped out regional differences in the tightness of social norms across China [R. Y. J. Chua, K. G. Huang, M. Jin, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 116, 6720–6725 (2019)]. Norms were tighter in developed, urbanized areas and weaker in rural areas. We tested whether historical paddy rice farming has left a legacy on social norms in modern China. Premodern rice farming could plausibly create strong social norms because paddy rice relied on irrigation networks. Rice farmers coordinated their water use and kept track of each person’s labor contributions. Rice villages also established strong norms of reciprocity to cope with labor demands that were twice as high as dryland crops like wheat. In line with this theory, China’s historically rice-farming areas had tighter social norms than wheat-farming areas, even beyond differences in development and urbanization. Rice–wheat differences were just as large among people in 10 neighboring provinces (n = 3,835) along the rice–wheat border. These neighboring provinces differ sharply in rice and wheat, but little in latitude, temperature, and other potential confounding variables. Outside of China, rice farming predicted norm tightness in 32 countries around the world. Finally, people in rice-farming areas scored lower on innovative thinking, which tends to be lower in societies with tight norms. This natural test case within China might explain why East Asia—historically reliant on rice farming—has tighter social norms than the wheat-farming West.",https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/117/33/19816.full.pdf,

In the summers 2014 and 2015, we collected leaf reflectance factor spectra of the vineyard using field spectroscopy along with grapevine physiological parameters. To comprehensively analyze the field-collected hyperspectral data, various band combinations were used to calculate the normalized difference spectral index (NDSI) along with 26 various indices from the literature. Then, the relationship between the indices and plant physiological parameters were examined and the strongest relationships were determined. We found that newly-identified NDSIs always performed better than the indices from the literature, and stomatal conductance (Gs) was the plant physiological parameter that showed the highest correlation with NDSI(R603,R558) calculated using leaf reflectance factor spectra (R2 = 0.720). Additionally, the best NDSI(R685,R415) for non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) was determined (R2 = 0.681). Gs resulted in being a proxy of water stress. Therefore, the partial least squares regression (PLSR) method was utilized to develop a predictive model for Gs. Our results showed that the PLSR model was inferior to the NDSI in Gs estimation (R2 = 0.680).

Climate Smart Agriculture (CSA) was introduced by the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) in 2010, as an innovative cleaner production alternative to conventional farming that aimed at increasing the efficiency of natural resources, resilience, and productivity of agricultural production system, while reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The adverse effects of climate change on cotton production at the farm and regional level can be minimized by using CSA practices and technologies. The present study investigated the financial performance and explored the impact of CSA through sustainable water use management on cotton production in Lower Bari Doab Canal (LBDC) irrigation system of Punjab, Pakistan by using Cobb-Douglas production function. The adopters of CSA in cotton cultivation were identified by conducting six focus group discussions. Data were collected through well-structured questionnaire from 133 adopters of CSA and 65 conventional cotton growers for the cropping season 2016–2017. It was found that water-smart (raising crops on bed, laser land levelling, conjunctive use of water and drainage management), energy-smart (minimum tillage), carbon-smart (less use of chemicals) and knowledge-smart (crop rotation and improved varieties i.e., tolerant to drought, flood and heat/cold stresses) practices and technologies of CSA were adopted by the cotton farmers in the study area. Most of the farmers were of the view that they are adopting CSA practices and technologies due to the limited supply of canal water, climate change, drought-prone, massive groundwater extraction, rapidly declining groundwater table and increasing soil salinity over the time. Results revealed that uniform germination, higher yield and financial returns, the concentration of inputs and increase in resource use efficiency are the main advantages of CSA. The econometric analysis showed that implementation of CSA practices and technologies as judicious use of water and fertilizer, groundwater quality, access to extension services, and appropriate method and time of picking have a significant impact on the gross value of cotton product (GVP). The findings of the study would be helpful for policy makers to formulate policies that can minimize farmer’s financial burden to adopt CSA technologies and implement for scaling out in Punjab and beyond.",https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/10/6/2101/pdf?version=1529481772,

The aim of this review is to report changes in irrigated cotton water use from research projects and on-farm practice-change programs in Australia, in relation to both plant-based and irrigation engineering disciplines. At least 80% of the Australian cotton-growing area is irrigated using gravity surface-irrigation systems. This review found that, over 23 years, cotton crops utilise 6–7 ML/ha of irrigation water, depending on the amount of seasonal rain received. The seasonal evapotranspiration of surface-irrigated crops averaged 729 mm over this period. Over the past decade, water-use productivity by Australian cotton growers has improved by 40%. This has been achieved by both yield increases and more efficient water-management systems. The whole-farm irrigation efficiency index improved from 57% to 70%, and the crop water use index is >3 kg/mm.ha, high by international standards. Yield increases over the last decade can be attributed to plant-breeding advances, the adoption of genetically modified varieties, and improved crop management. Also, there has been increased use of irrigation scheduling tools and furrow-irrigation system optimisation evaluations. This has reduced in-field deep-drainage losses. The largest loss component of the farm water balance on cotton farms is evaporation from on-farm water storages. Some farmers are changing to alternative systems such as centre pivots and lateral-move machines, and increasing numbers of these alternatives are expected. These systems can achieve considerable labour and water savings, but have significantly higher energy costs associated with water pumping and machine operation. The optimisation of interactions between water, soils, labour, carbon emissions and energy efficiency requires more research and on-farm evaluations. Standardisation of water-use efficiency measures and improved water measurement techniques for surface irrigation are important research outcomes to enable valid irrigation benchmarks to be established and compared. Water-use performance is highly variable between cotton farmers and farming fields and across regions. Therefore, site-specific measurement is important. The range in the presented datasets indicates potential for further improvement in water-use efficiency and productivity on Australian cotton farms.",http://www.publish.csiro.au/cp/pdf/CP13315,

In Tanzania as in most African countries, farming depends almost entirely on rainfall, a situation that makes agriculture and thus rural livelihoods especially in semiarid environments particularly vulnerable to climate change. This study analyses the impacts of climate change and variability on rural livelihoods with particular focus on agricultural production, food security and adaptive capacities in semiarid areas of Tanzania. The methods used in this study included focus group discussions, key informant interviews, household surveys and field observations. Results from the study indicate that communities understood climate change in terms of variability in rainfall patterns and amount, temperature patterns, wind, water availability, increased incidences of drought and decreased agricultural productivity. Communities in the study area acknowledged that while rainfall amounts have decreased over the last thirty years, temperatures have increased; an experience is also supported by meteorological data. Such changes were claimed to have reduced agricultural productivity particularly due to prolonged drought, inadequate and uneven distribution of rainfall as well as unpredictable onset and ending of rains. Stressors such as crop diseases and pests, low soil fertility and inadequate extension services were also reported to contribute to the decline in agricultural productivity and re-occurrence of food insecurity. In response, communities have developed multiple adaptation strategies, including growing of drought tolerant and early maturing crop varieties, increasing wetlands cultivation, water harvesting for small-scale irrigation and livestock keeping. However, households with limited livelihood assets are more vulnerable to the impacts of climate change and food insecurity. The study argues that diversification of adaptive strategies, such as water harvesting for small-scale irrigation, integration of livestock and crop production are crucial to ensuring sustainable livelihood in a changing climate.",http://www.scirp.org/journal/PaperDownload.aspx?paperID=33833,

Methods: The present formative research was undertaken in the 23 villages surrounding the Anji Primary Health Centre, located in the Vidarbha region of Maharashtra, India. A triangulation of free list and pile sort exercises was used. The data was analyzed by Anthropac 4.98.1/X software. This was followed by a semi-structured focus group discussion. To increase the validity of the results, these findings were presented to the participants and later they were circulated to the 26 farmers’ clubs in the villages for comment and discussion during their monthly, village based meetings. Results: Farmers perceived debt, addiction, environmental problems, poor prices for farm produce, stress and family responsibilities, government apathy, poor irrigation, increased cost of cultivation, private money lenders, use of chemical fertilizers and crop failure as the reasons for farmers’ suicides. Participants suggested solutions such as self-reliance and capacity building among farmers, a monitoring and support system for vulnerable farmers, support and counseling services, a village-level, transparent system for the disbursement of relief packages. Conclusions: Farmers’ suicides in Vidarbha are caused by the complex interplay of social, political and environmental constraints. Hence, a comprehensive intervention to ensure self reliance and capacity building among farmers in modern farming techniques , monitoring and support system for vulnerable farmers, a village-level, transparent system for disbursement of relief packages is required to prevent farmer suicides in the near future.

Additionally, the export of virtual water through rice trading and the looming water crisis poses significant threats to the sustainability of rice production and food security. There are several alternative rice production methods to improve water use efficiency. These include aerobic rice, direct-seeded rice (DSR), alternate wetting and drying (AWD), saturated soil culture (SSC), drip-irrigated rice, a system of rice intensification (SRI), and smart irrigation with sensors and the Internet of Things (IoT). However, each method has its own advantages and disadvantages. For example, drip-irrigated rice and IoT-based automated irrigation are not feasible for poor farmers due to the high production costs associated with specialized machinery and tools. Similarly, aerobic rice, drip-irrigated rice, and the SRI are labor-intensive, making them unsuitable for areas with a shortage of labor. On the other hand, DSR is suitable for labor-scarce areas, provided herbicides are used to control weeds. In this article, the suitability of different water-saving rice production methods is reviewed based on factors such as climate, soil type, labor, energy, and greenhouse gas emissions, and their prospects and challenges are evaluated. Additionally, the article examines how cultural practices, such as seed treatment, weed control, and nutrition management, contribute to enhancing water use efficiency in rice production.",https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4441/15/10/1802/pdf?version=1684920214,

Microbiomes of both, gut and plants, are known for their importance for the host's nutrient uptake, protection against pathogens and abiotic stress as well as for providing metabolic capacities (Sekirov et al., 2010; Mitter et al., 2013; Ramirez-Puebla et al., 2013). The plant microbiome has been further suggested as an extension of the host phenotype (Aleklett and Hart, 2013). Plant–microbe interactions are highly specific with plant microbiota being driven by the host genotype and physiology (e.g. root exudates and metabolites) as well as environmental factors (Rasche et al., 2006; Lundberg et al., 2012). Few examples of beneficial plant–microbe interactions are well investigated and explored in regard to their importance in agricultural systems. These include biological nitrogen fixation by rhizobia, which establish a symbiosis with legumes and represent the basis of crop rotations including legumes contributing to the maintenance of soil fertility. Furthermore, about 80% of land plant species are internally colonized by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. In this symbiosis, arbuscules and vesicles are formed from the hyphae being particularly important for plant nutrient acquisition. In addition, the more specialized symbiotic defensive mutualism between Pooideae grasses and endophytic fungi of the Epichloe is well explored (Clay, 1988) and important for pasture production. Apart from these well-known mutualistic plant–microbe interactions, beneficial microorganisms have been hardly considered in crop production strategies. However, considering the demonstrated functional importance of the plant microbiome, the effects that can be observed upon the inoculation of selected microorganisms and the fact that plants and microorganisms carry genetic determinants needed for their interaction, we predict that plant microbiome functions will be an essential component of tomorrow's crop production. Plant microbiome composition is affected by various host-driven factors, including for instance the plant genotype, and by agricultural practices such as fertilization or pesticide application. Although we still hardly understand how microbiome functioning is affected by such structural changes, it is likely that functioning will be affected as well. Whereas conventional agriculture has not yet started to consider potential harm on the functioning of plant-associated microbiota due to current practices, organic farming systems generally aim at making best use of natural resources and maintaining biodiversity (Mader et al., 2002). For instance, crop rotations with legumes are applied, and usually higher plant diversity is used or maintained resulting in a more efficient exploration and maintenance of microbial functions. Alongside the general trend to increase the sustainability of agricultural practices such as different soil preparation practices, fertilizer or pesticide treatments might be better selected in regard to favouring or exhibiting least adverse effects on desirable plant microbiome functions. Apart from efficacy, the effect on the plant microbiome could be one selection criterion. Furthermore, dosage effects might be important to consider. Overdosing fertilizers or pesticides might have more adverse effects on microbiome activities than lower amounts still suitable for suitable efficacy. Industry has started to exploit individual microorganisms mostly as microbial plant protection products or as biofertilizers. There is a rapidly increasing interest from the industry on microbial products due to a far higher demand of alternatives to current pesticides and fertilizers strongly promoted by national strategic plans to restrict chemical input in agriculture. However, despite the high potential such microbial inoculants have frequently shown in lab and greenhouse experiments, the efficacy and the consistency of desired effects of microorganisms under various field conditions still represent a major bottleneck for product development. Therefore, there is an urgent need to improve selection processes, application techniques and particularly to better understand the interaction between plants and microorganisms under field conditions. Tremendous information on the mechanisms involved in plant–microbe interactions has been obtained with model plants grown under gnotobiotic conditions. Now, scientists have started to realize that for improving field efficiency, it is of utmost importance to use relevant plant cultivars and to better understand microbial activities in the field. Such an understanding will reveal under which (field-relevant) conditions a microbial strain exhibits desired activities, or whether co-colonizing microorganisms promote or interfere with specific activities of an inoculant strain. This in combination with improved application technologies and improved formulations will greatly improve the efficacy of microbial products. In the future, we will also be able to make better use of synergistic and complementary mechanisms of individual strains and design microbiomes supporting plant growth and health. Similarly, concepts might be developed considering the transplantation of microbiomes, for instance plant microbiomes growing well under adverse conditions could serve as inoculants or at least as model for the design of ‘synthetic’ microbiomes. Plants respond to microbiota, have genetic determinants to interact with microorganisms, and relationships between host and microbiome evolution have been shown (Bouffaud et al., 2014; Delaux et al., 2014). This implies that plants could be improved either by genetic improvement, selection or breeding in regard to a more efficient interaction with beneficial microorganisms. Whereas in the last decades, plants have been mostly improved and selected for higher yield and resistance, gazing into our crystal ball we foresee that efficient interaction with beneficial microorganisms will be an additional breeding target. Applications might range from breeding legumes for improved interaction with well-known rhizobial symbionts to crops reducing interactions with specific pathogens and enhancing mutualists or plants triggering specific microbiome components. A more detailed understanding on the molecular mechanisms used by plants to interact with mutualists will lead to the development of suitable breeding targets and screening approaches. Plant breeding or genetic modification may lead in the future to the identification of plant lines ensuring improved resource efficiency, tolerance of abiotic stress and defense against pests and pathogens. Maintaining plant beneficial microbiome functions is particularly important for maintaining yield stability and to enable plant growth under (sometimes unexpected) suboptimal conditions such as drought or pathogen infestation. Although plant microbiomes have high potential to improve overall crop production worldwide, they will be particularly important for plant production under constrained conditions, where limited resources are available to irrigate, fertilize or treat plant diseases. This is the case in many parts of the world, where low input agriculture is common practice and improved germ plasm or agricultural amendments are hardly available. Making better use of plant microbiome functions will particularly support agricultural production under these conditions and foster the bio-economy of less developed countries providing microbial inoculants and establishing strain collections from local environments.",https://europepmc.org/articles/pmc4321367?pdf=render,

The Tarim River basin, located in Xinjiang, NW China, is the largest endorheic river basin in China and one of the largest in all of Central Asia. Due to the extremely arid climate, with an annual precipitation of less than 100 mm, the water supply along the Aksu and Tarim rivers solely depends on river water. This is linked to anthropogenic activities (e.g., agriculture) and natural and semi-natural ecosystems as both compete for water. The ongoing increase in water consumption by agriculture and other human activities in this region has been enhancing the competition for water between human needs and nature. Against this background, 11 German and 6 Chinese universities and research institutes have formed the consortium SuMaRiO (Sustainable Management of River Oases along the Tarim River; http://www.sumario.de ), which aims to create a holistic picture of the availability of water resources in the Tarim River basin and the impacts on anthropogenic activities and natural ecosystems caused by the water distribution within the Tarim River basin. On the basis of the results from field studies and modeling approaches as well as from suggestions by the relevant regional stakeholders, a decision support tool (DST) will be implemented that will then assist stakeholders in balancing the competition for water, acknowledging the major external effects of water allocation to agriculture and to natural ecosystems. This consortium was formed in 2011 and is funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research. As the data collection phase was finished this year, the paper presented here brings together the results from the fields from the disciplines of climate modeling, cryology, hydrology, agricultural sciences, ecology, geoinformatics, and social sciences in order to present a comprehensive picture of the effects of different water availability schemes on anthropogenic activities and natural ecosystems along the Tarim River. The second objective is to present the project structure of the whole consortium, the current status of work (i.e., major new results and findings), explain the foundation of the decision support tool as a key product of this project, and conclude with application recommendations for the region. The discharge of the Aksu River, which is the major tributary of the Tarim, has been increasing over the past 6 decades. From 1989 to 2011, agricultural area more than doubled: cotton became the major crop and there was a shift from small-scale to large-scale intensive farming. The ongoing increase in irrigated agricultural land leads to the increased threat of salinization and soil degradation caused by increased evapotranspiration. Aside from agricultural land, the major natural and semi-natural ecosystems are riparian (Tugai) forests, shrub vegetation, reed beds, and other grassland, as well as urban and peri-urban vegetation. Within the SuMaRiO cluster, focus has been set on the Tugai forests, with Populus euphratica as the dominant tree species, because these forests belong to the most productive and species-rich natural ecosystems of the Tarim River basin. At sites close to the groundwater, the annual stem diameter increments of Populus euphratica correlated with the river runoffs of the previous year. However, the natural river dynamics cease along the downstream course and thus hamper the recruitment of Populus euphratica. A study on the willingness to pay for the conservation of the natural ecosystems was conducted to estimate the concern of the people in the region and in China's capital. These household surveys revealed that there is a considerable willingness to pay for conservation of the natural ecosystems, with mitigation of dust and sandstorms considered the most important ecosystem service. Stakeholder dialogues contributed to creating a scientific basis for a sustainable management in the future.",https://esd.copernicus.org/articles/6/83/2015/esd-6-83-2015.pdf,

Machine learning is one such technique employed to predict crop yield in agriculture. Various machine learning techniques such as prediction, classification, regression and clustering are utilized to forecast crop yield. Artificial neural networks, support vector machines, linear and logistic regression, decision trees, Naive Bayes are some of the algorithms used to implement prediction. However, the selection of the appropriate algorithm from the pool of available algorithms imposes challenge to the researcher with respect to the chosen crop. In this paper, an investigation has been performed on how various machine learning algorithms are useful in prediction of crop yield.

However, highly skilled labor is increasingly lacking in the greenhouse sector. Moreover, extreme events such as the COVID-19 pandemic, can make farms temporarily less accessible. This highlights the need for more autonomous and remote-control strategies for greenhouse production. This paper describes and analyzes the results of the second “Autonomous Greenhouse Challenge”. In this challenge, an experiment was conducted in six high-tech greenhouse compartments during a period of six months of cherry tomato growing. The primary goal of the greenhouse operation was to maximize net profit, by controlling the greenhouse climate and crop with AI techniques. Five international teams with backgrounds in AI and horticulture were challenged in a competition to operate their own compartment remotely. They developed intelligent algorithms and use sensor data to determine climate setpoints and crop management strategy. All AI supported teams outperformed a human-operated greenhouse that served as reference. From the results obtained by the teams and from the analysis of the different climate-crop strategies, it was possible to detect challenges and opportunities for the future implementation of remote-control systems in greenhouse production.",https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/20/22/6430/pdf,

It was found that more than 5% of the study area (total size 16.8 km2) was used for farming in backyard gardens and larger open spaces. The proportion of habitats containing Anopheles larvae was 1.7 times higher in agricultural areas compared to other areas (95% confidence interval = 1.56-1.92). Significant geographic predictors of the presence of Anopheles larvae in gardens included location in lowland areas, proximity to river, and relatively impermeable soils. Agriculture-related predictors comprised specific seedbed types, mid-sized gardens, irrigation by wells, as well as cultivation of sugar cane or leafy vegetables. Negative predictors included small garden size, irrigation by tap water, rainfed production and cultivation of leguminous crops or fruit trees. Although there was an increased chance of finding Anopheles larvae in agricultural sites, it was found that breeding sites originated by urban agriculture account for less than a fifth of all breeding sites of malaria vectors in Dar es Salaam.

Consumer interest has also increased dramatically, both for health and environmental reasons (Greene, 2000; Lampkin, 1990; Uri, 1999). Since 1996, surveys of natural food wholesalers and retailers indicated that organic produce sales had increased ≈20% yearly (Dimitri and Richman, 2000; Greene, 2001; Greene et al., 2001). Certified organic produce typically commands a higher price than conventionally grown produce. A recent survey of North Carolina-based natural food retailers and wholesalers indicated that buyers were willing to pay up to 25% more for organically grown vegetables (Estes et al., 1999). As a result of all these factors, an increasing number of growers are considering the use of, or are already employing, organic production methods. Barriers to organic certification are particularly high for greenhouse vegetable growers because virtually no technical information is available. Practices used by an experienced greenhouse organic grower to grow plants in soil have been documented (Grubinger, 1999), but specific practices for injecting fertilizer in the drip irrigation lines were not adequately described. Several grower-formulated mixtures for organic transplant production have been described (Smith, 1994), but there is little or no documentation on how to prepare organic mixes for recirculating hydroponic systems or how to add composts to soilless media used for crop production. Compost teas can be used for drip irrigation in certified organic production. However, in a manual describing the use of compost teas, Ingram and Alms (1999) describe work on compost teas as being in its infancy. The beneficial effects of compost teas were demonstrated, but most testing was conducted by trial and error. This is also true of studies using organic composts as ingredients in potting mixes and in many cases, media and waste characteristics were not reported in detail. In Germany, effluent from a fish farming unit was brought into a hydroponic cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.) and tomato greenhouse as a substitute for some of the normal fertilization (Drews and Rennert, 1992). In this study, the amount of fertilizer added to the hydroponic system was reduced by 16% for N, 14% for P, and 12% for K. Although a few examples of the successful use of organic materials in greenhouse vegetable production have been documented, it is hard to extrapolate findings to other crops and media. Broiler litter has been tested as a potting component for lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.) (Flynn et al., 1995). There are also examples where system components were well described. Tyler et al. (1993a, 1993b), Kraus et al. (2000), and Kraus and Warren (2000) conducted a series of studies of the effects of composted poultry litter on growth of containerized nursery crops. These studies described the chemical and physical characteristics of litter when combined with a pine bark substrate. However, as nursery crops grow more slowly than tomato crops, their results cannot be directly applied to a greenhouse tomato production system. Since there are no generally accepted recommendations or guidelines specifically for organic production of greenhouse tomatoes, this study was designed as a systems research project. As such, management practices for each growing season utilized information gathered from the previous growing season(s) to optimize practices for each system. The objectives of this study were to discover methods to produce healthy and productive tomato plants using flowable organic fertilizers, determine formulations for such fertilizers, and develop an organic growing medium that promotes healthy and productive tomato plants. The goal of this research project was to develop a certifiable organic regimen for growing greenhouse tomatoes that would be comparable with those grown conventionally with regard to production methods, as well as nutritional status in leaf tissue, plant development, and harvest yields.",https://journals.ashs.org/downloadpdf/journals/hortsci/39/2/article-p223.pdf,

Notable changes in rainfall patterns and deficiencies in soil moisture are estimated and discussed, as well as the impact of rainfall variability on crop production and proposed adaptation strategies in agriculture. Climate moisture index (CMI) was used to assess aridity levels. Southern Africa is described as a climate hotspot due to increasing aridity, low adaptive capacity, underdevelopment and marginalisation. Although crop yields have been increasing due to increases in irrigated area and use of improved seed varieties, they have not been able to meet the food requirements of a growing population, compromising regional food security targets. Most countries in the region depend on international aid to supplement yield deficits. The recurrence of droughts caused by the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) continue devastating the region, affecting livelihoods, economies and the environment. An example is the 2015/16 ENSO drought that caused the region to call for international aid to feed about 40 million people. In spite of the water scarcity challenges, cereal production continues to increase steadily due to increased investment in irrigated agriculture and improved crop varieties. Given the current and future vulnerability of the agriculture sector in southern Africa, proactive adaptation interventions are important to help farming communities develop resilient systems to adapt to the changes and variability in climate and other stressors.",https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0472/9/2/30/pdf?version=1550313740,

The data are analyzed using graphs, figures, tables and narrations. Ethiopia shows remarkable economic growth, and the agricultural sector takes the highest contribution. Crops take the highest share in total production and area coverage which constituted on average 68% of the Ethiopian agricultural gross domestic product. Consequently, wheat is an important cereal crop which makes a significant contribution to the development of the agricultural sector in general and to the farm household food security status in particular. In Ethiopia, wheat production and productivity has shown increasing rate, especially from 2005 to 2017. This makes Ethiopia as one of the largest wheat producers in sub-Saharan countries. Even though it shows potential, wheat production and productivity is relatively small by global standards. The main reason is that mostly subsistence farming of wheat is produced by small-scale farmers through rain feed production system with less irrigated production. Additionally, existing wheat production and marketing system is exacerbated by constraints which have their own influence on decreasing yield of wheat. But, in opposite to the constraints, there are also important opportunities which motivate wheat production and marketing trends of farmers and traders. Finally, to bring wheat production and marketing development in Ethiopia, attention from responsible bodies on the expansion of infrastructure, awareness creation for wheat farmers through training on value-adding activities, intervention on the expansion of irrigable land and motivating large-scale farms have been suggested.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/23311932.2020.1778893?needAccess=true,

However, the RF system has not been promoted widely in the semi-arid regions, which primarily exist in remote hilly areas. To exploit its efficiency on a large-scale, the RF system needs to be tested at different amounts of simulated precipitation combined with deficit irrigation. Therefore, in during the 2015–16 and 2016–17 winter wheat growing seasons, we examined the effects of two planting patterns: (1) the RF system and (2) traditional flat planting (TF) with three deficit irrigation levels (150, 75, 0 mm) under three simulated rainfall intensity (1: 275, 2: 200, 3: 125 mm), and determined soil water storage profile, evapotranspiration rate, grain filling rate, biomass, grain yield, and net economic return. Over the two study years, the RF treatment with 200 mm simulated rainfall and 150 mm deficit irrigation (RF2150) significantly (P < 0.05) increased soil water storage in the depth of (200 cm); reduced ET at the field scale by 33%; increased total dry matter accumulation per plant; increased the grain-filling rate; and improved biomass (11%) and grain (19%) yields. The RF2150 treatment thus achieved a higher WUE (76%) and RIWP (21%) compared to TF. Grain-filling rates, grain weight of superior and inferior grains, and net economic profit of winter wheat responded positively to simulated rainfall and deficit irrigation under both planting patterns. The 200 mm simulated rainfall amount was more economical than other precipitation amounts, and led to slight increases in soil water storage, total dry matter per plant, and grain yield; there were no significant differences when the simulated rainfall was increased beyond 200 mm. The highest (12,593 Yuan ha−1) net income profit was attained using the RF system at 200 mm rainfall and 150 mm deficit irrigation, which also led to significantly higher grain yield, WUE, and RIWP than all other treatments. Thus, we recommend the RF2150 treatment for higher productivity, income profit, and improve WUE in the dry-land farming system of China.",https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpls.2017.01408/pdf,

T global arable land base is estimated at 1.351 billion hectares which amounts to about 0.19 ha per person based on a population of 7 billion (World Fact Book, 2012). With the projected population increase to 9 billion by 2050, the per capita arable land amount will be 0.15 ha per person but in actual fact much less because an extra 2 billion people will require additional land for infrastructure. Also, the fact that 93 to 99% of the food consumed by humans comes from the land (Pimentel and Pimentel, 2000; Smil, 2000) implies that food production per unit area will have to increase. However, 45% of global arable soils are aff ected by degradation (Lal, 2007). Th e Food and Agriculture Organization endorses conservation agriculture as the key step to meeting the long-term global demand for food, feed, and fi ber for the projected 9 billion people by 2050 (Mackenzie, 2009). Irrigated land comprises about 7% of the total arable land area (World Fact Book, 2012) and land under irrigation will probably not increase to make up for short falls in food production because of competing fresh water needs by a growing population. Th erefore dry land farming systems will need to become more productive which means more water effi cient. Th e positive benefi ts of no-till production systems on crop production (Lafond et al., 1996, 2006b), economic performance (Gray et al., 1996; Zentner et al., 2002; Holm et al., 2006) and energy use effi ciency (Zentner et al., 2004) are well recognized in the Northern Great Plains. More recent no-till studies have demonstrated additional yield increases in spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and canola (Brassica napus L.) as length of time under no-till increases (Lafond et al., 2011). Additional benefi ts from no-till can be obtained if crops are seeded into tall stubble. Increases in grain yield and water use effi ciency have been observed for spring wheat (Cutforth and McConkey, 1997), canola (Cutforth et al., 2006), fi eld pea (Pisum sativum L.), lentil (Lens culinaris Medik.), and chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.) (Cutforth et al., 2002) when seeding into >30 cm tall stubble. Tall stubble reduces water loss from evaporation at the soil surface and increases water available for transpiration, thereby explaining the greater reported crop water use effi ciencies and grain yields when compared to shorter or no stubble. Growing crops into tall stubble combined with long-term no-till represents an important approach to increasing crop production under semiarid dryland farming conditions. Given the reported benefi ts of no-till production systems, seeding into standing stubble and through surface residues has challenges. One solution to reduce plugging is to increase the row spacing. Th e common accepted knowledge is that narrow row spacing gives greater grain yields in cereal crops (Austenson and Larter, 1969; Briggs, 1975; Bauder, 1990; Chen et al., 2008). However, other studies have shown that it is possible to use wider spacing without experiencing grain yield losses. Research with no-till winter wheat showed equivalent yields between 18 and 36 cm under semiarid conditions (McCleod et al., 1996) and among 10-, 20-, and 30-cm row spacing under subhumid conditions (Lafond and Gan, 1999). With spring wheat, no diff erences in yield were observed among 10-, 20-, and 30-cm row spacing under no-till (Lafond, 1994; Bailey et al., 1998) and conventional till systems (Lafond and Derksen, 1996) and between 23 and 30 cm with no-till (Johnston and Stevenson, 2001) under subhumid conditions. No grain yield diff erences were observed among 10-, 20-, and 30-cm spacing in barley with no-till (Lafond, 1994; Bailey et al., 1998) and conventional till (Lafond and Derksen, 1996) under subhumid ABSTRACT",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.2134/agronj2012.0221,

However, the effects will be more in countries whose economy depends on agriculture. This study aims to measure the economic impacts of climate change on crop farming in Bangladesh. Design/methodology/approach A Ricardian model was used to estimate the relationship between net crop income and climate variables. Historical climate data and farm household level data from all climatic zones of Bangladesh were collected for this purpose. A regression model was then developed of net crop income per hectare against long-term climate, household and farm variables. Marginal impacts of climate change and potential future impacts of projected climate scenarios on net crop incomes were also estimated. Findings The results revealed that net crop income in Bangladesh is sensitive to climate, particularly to seasonal temperature. A positive effect of temperature rise on net crop income was observed for the farms located in the areas having sufficient irrigation facilities. Estimated marginal impact suggests that 1 mm/month increase in rainfall and 10°C increase in temperature will lead to about US$4-15 increase in net crop income per hectare in Bangladesh. However, there will be significant seasonal and spatial variations in the impacts. The assessment of future impacts under climate change scenarios projected by Global Circulation Models indicated an increase in net crop income from US$25-84 per hectare in the country. Research limitations/implications The findings of this study indicate the need for development practitioners and policy planners to consider both the beneficial and harmful effects of climate change across different climatic zones while designing and implementing the adaptation policies in the country.

The spatiotemporal variations in rainfall and temperature have influence particularly in poorly‐developed agrarian regions with limited or no irrigation infrastructure. Therefore, a systematic understanding of climate patterns across space and time is important for mitigating against food insecurity and household poverty. Using over a century of high‐spatial resolution data, this study examines the spatiotemporal variations in rainfall and temperature across Ghana to identify climate‐stressed locations with potential effect on the production of major staple crops. The data for the analysis were drawn from the University of Delaware's Gridded Precipitation and Temperature Monthly Climatology version 4.01. The analysis was restricted to the main crop‐growing periods (March to December). The Mann‐Kendall nonparametric regression test was used to examine significant changes in rainfall variability and temperature at the district level. The results show that Ghana's climate has become progressively drier over the last century and prone to drought conditions. The most climate‐stressed districts are clustered within the three northern regions (Upper West, Upper East, and Northern) and the Western region. The most recent census in Ghana shows that the three northern regions also have the highest prevalence of subsistence agriculture.

Researchers and scientists are now moving toward the utilization of new IoT technologies in smart farming to help farmers use AI technology in the development of improved seeds, crop protection, and fertilizers. This will improve farmers’ profitability and the overall economy of the country.

There are 10 irrigation technologies that farmers can adopt for cotton production in these 14 cotton-growing states. The intensity of the irrigation technologies, as measured by the number of irrigation technologies adopted in cotton production, is affected by the irrigated cotton yield realized, land holding (total land owned), education, computer use, and the origin of the cotton farmer being from the Southern Plains.

Based on current conditions and historical records, profitability in production farming depends on making a right and timely operational decision. Precision farming is a systematic program designed to maximize the productivity of agriculture by carefully tailoring the soil and crop management to meet the specific requirements in each field while preserving environmental quality. This review paper highlights the development of an automated irrigation system with portable wireless sensor networks and decision support methods to remotely measure the environmental parameters in an agriculture field. Radio satellite, mobile phones, sensors, internet-based communication, and microcontroller capture the ecological parameters such as soil moisture, temperature, humidity, and light intensity. The knowledge gained from the sensors is transferred directly to the cloud server by using IoT technology. Users from anywhere in the world can display them through an internet-enabled device. Development of sensor-based application in modern agriculture makes it cost-effective and potentially productive and increases the efficiency through precision agriculture farming. Different limitations have been reported in the previously reviewed publications like the shortage of power in the field that can be solved by using a solar panel that recharges the battery at the same time using electricity.

We conducted reconnaissance and diagnostic surveys by systematically and randomly selecting 147 farming households in the three agroecologies of the study area. A logit regression model was employed to determine how these factors influence farmers’ adoption decision. The findings indicate that a majority of the households (46.3%) were engaged in homestead agroforestry practices (AFP), followed by live fence (25.9%) and farmland or parkland (15%) agroforestry practices. The study identified Carica papaya, Malus domestic, Persea americana, Mangifera indica, Ziziphus spina-christi, and Balanites aegyptiaca as the most dominant fruit tree species found in the home garden agroforestry. In total, 68% of the households had some of these fruit trees around their home gardens. We also established the three most dominant agricultural production systems as: i) Agricultural production system, composed of fruit tree + cereal crops + Ziziphus spina-christi + Balanites aegyptiaca and/or acacia species; ii) agricultural production system, consisting of cash crops, like Coffee arabica and Catha edulies + fruit trees + Cordia africana + Balanites aegyptiaca and/or acacia species; and iii) agricultural production, composed of fruit trees + vegetables within a boundary of Sesbania sesban and other acacia species in the modern irrigated land. Furthermore, 90.16% of the households in the highlands reported a shortage of farmland for planting trees as the main constraint. About 34.44% farmers reported using leaves of Cordia africana, Balanites aegyptiaca, pods of acacia species, and crop residue as the main source of animal fodder. In total, 86.4% of the households also recognized the importance of multipurpose trees for soil fertility enhancement, control of runoff, microclimate amelioration, environmental protection, and dry season animal fodder. According to the logit model analysis, sex, family size, educational level, and landholding significantly (p < 0.05) influence the household’s role in the adoption of agroforestry practices. Based on these findings, farmers used different adaptation strategies, such as planting of multi-purpose trees (34.7%), conservation tillage to minimize both erosion and runoff potentials as soil conservation strategies (27.2%), varying planting dates, use of drought tolerant crop varieties (16.3%), and others based on farmers’ indigenous knowledge passed down from generation to generation. We conclude that agroforestry practices are important components of farming systems in Tigray, resulting in diversified products and ecological benefits that improve socio-ecological resilience.

Drought stress, in combination with century-long socio-political issues such as unequal social structure, gender discrimination, and marginalization of poor and disadvantaged groups have made smallholders more vulnerable in society. Climate changes are exacerbating issues within an already vulnerable society. Therefore, a review study on the impact of drought on the rain-fed hill farming system, and the potential adaptation measures, was carried out in the mid-hill region of western Nepal. Both agricultural impacts such as depletion of traditional varieties of crops, crop-specific diseases, low production, lack of water for irrigation; and non-agricultural impacts such as changing rural livelihood patterns, and social conflict due to agriculture and water issues were identified as major impacts. Some of the agricultural adaptation measures viz. the promotion of climate smart agriculture practices, crop diversification, and agroforestry practices seem to have been more effective in the region. At the same time, small-scale structural water harvesting measures, for instance, rainwater harvesting, conservation ponds, and irrigation channels, drip water irrigation, and an early warning system for drought events could also be an advantage in this context. Nonetheless, there are several adaptation barriers including ecological and physical constraints, human and information resource-shortages, and social barriers to adaptation. Therefore, local site-specific adaptation measures should be developed, and implemented, to increase the adaptive capacity of smallholders, and enhance the farming system in the face of the climate-induced drought scenario.",https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3298/5/9/101/pdf?version=1535959733,

Several empirical studies have shown that the implementation of adaptation practices can reduce the adverse effects of CC. The likelihood of farmers performing adaptation practices is mostly influenced by the degree of CC impact that they perceive. Thus, we identified the characteristics of farmers that affect the degree of the CC impact that they perceive. We used data from the Indonesian Rice Farm Household survey consisting of 87,330 farmers. An ordered probit regression model was used to estimate the effect of each variable on the degree of the perceived impact of CC. The results of this study confirm those of previous empirical studies. Several variables that have been identified as having a positive effect on farmer adaptation practices, such as farmer education, land tenure, irrigation infrastructure, cropping system, chemical fertilizer application, access to extension services, and participation in farmer groups, negatively affect the degree of the perceived impact of CC. However, a different result was found in the estimation of the gender variable. We found that female farmers have a higher CC resilience and ability to withstand climatic shocks and risks than male farmers. Female farmers have a more positive perception of future farming conditions than male farmers. We recommend the implementation of a national adaptation policy that use and expand the channel of agricultural extension services to deliver the planned adaptation policy, and prioritizes farmers with insecure land tenure. Additionally, we encourage the increasing of female involvement in the CC adaptation practices and decision-making processes.",https://doi.org/10.3390/land8050081,

Ethanol used as automotive fuel has increased at least six times in the current century. According to the Renewable Fuels Association, in 2010 the USA bio-refineries generated 13 billion gallons of fuel ethanol and the year before worldwide production reached 19 billion. This noteworthy increment is in its majority based on maize and sugar cane as raw materials (Berg, 2004; Renewable Fuels Association, 2010). The use of these feedstocks has triggered concerns related to food security especially today when the world population has reached 7 billion people. The relatively sudden rise in food prices during 2008, 2010 and 2011 has been attributed mainly to the use of maize for bioethanol even when other factors like droughts or changes in global consumption patterns have also played a major role (World Food Program, 2008). Food price projections indicate that this situation will worsen, breaking the downward trend registered in food prices in the last thirty years (The Economist, 2007). Even if there was not a food-fuel controversy especially due to the current conversion of millions of tons of maize for bioethanol, the use of only this crop cannot support the ambitious objectives of renewable fuel legislation in countries like the United States of America, where a target of 36 billion gallons of liquid biofuels have been established for 2022. In order to meet this requirement all the 333 million tons of maize yearly produced by USA should be channelled to biorefineries. This production represents 2 and 16 times the maize harvested in countries like China and Mexico respectively, which in turn are two of the five top world producers. Environmental factors have been also pushing for the quest of new crops dedicated exclusively for liquid automotive fuel in order to reduce the use of prime farming land, irrigation water and other resources. A dedicated energy crop ideally must meet several requirements such as: high biomass yield and growth rate, perennial, with reduced input necessities, fully adapted to the geographic regions where will be planted, easy to manipulate via genetic improvement, non-invasive, tolerant to stress and with a good carbon sequestration rate among others (Jessup, 2009).

However, future projections typically do not consider the effects of agronomic adaptation in farming practices. We use an ensemble of seven Global Gridded Crop Models to quantify the impacts and adaptation potential of field crops under increasing temperature up to 6 K, accounting for model uncertainty. We find that without adaptation, the dominant effect of temperature increase is to shorten the growing period and to reduce grain yields and production. We then test the potential of two agronomic measures to combat warming‐induced yield reduction: (i) use of cultivars with adjusted phenology to regain the reference growing period duration and (ii) conversion of rainfed systems to irrigated ones in order to alleviate the negative temperature effects that are mediated by crop evapotranspiration. We find that cultivar adaptation can fully compensate global production losses up to 2 K of temperature increase, with larger potentials in continental and temperate regions. Irrigation could also compensate production losses, but its potential is highest in arid regions, where irrigation expansion would be constrained by water scarcity. Moreover, we discuss that irrigation is not a true adaptation measure but rather an intensification strategy, as it equally increases production under any temperature level. In the tropics, even when introducing both adapted cultivars and irrigation, crop production declines already at moderate warming, making adaptation particularly challenging in these areas.",https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1029/2018EF001130,

Agricultural water demand, which is more than 80% of the total water consumption, is primarily met through the massive exploitation of groundwater. The enormous imbalance between groundwater discharge (27.8 billion m3) and recharge (5.3 billion m3) is causing the excessive lowering of groundwater levels. Therefore, GCC countries are investing heavily in the production of nonconventional water resources such as desalination of seawater and treated wastewater. Currently, 439 desalination plants are annually producing 5.75 billion m3 of desalinated water in the GCC countries. The annual wastewater collection is about 4.0 billion m3, of which 73% is treated with the help of 300 wastewater treatment plants. Despite extreme water poverty, only 39% of the treated wastewater is reused, and the remaining is discharged into the sea. The treated wastewater (TWW) is used for the landscape, forestry, and construction industries. However, its reuse to irrigate food and forage crops is restricted due to health, social, religious, and environmental concerns. Substantial research evidence exists that treated wastewater can safely be used to grow food and forage crops under the agroclimatic conditions of the GCC countries by adopting appropriate management measures. Therefore, GCC countries should work on increasing the use of TWW in the agriculture sector. Increased use of TWW in agriculture can significantly reduce the pressure on freshwater resources. For this purpose, a comprehensive awareness campaign needs to be initiated to address the social and religious concerns of farming communities and consumers. Several internal and external risks can jeopardize the sustainable use of treated wastewater in the GCC countries. These include climate change, increasing costs, technological and market-driven changes, and regional security issues. Therefore, effective response mechanisms should be developed to mitigate future risks and threats.

Increasing world population, climate variations, and propelling demand for the food are the hot discussions these days. Keeping in view the importance of the abovementioned issues, this manuscript summarizes the modern approaches of IoT and smart techniques to aid sustainable crop production. The study also demonstrates the benefits of using modern IoT approaches and smart techniques in the establishment of smart- and resource-use-efficient farming systems. Modern technology not only aids in sustaining productivity under limited resources, but also can help in observing climatic variations, monitoring soil nutrients, water dynamics, supporting data management in farming systems, and assisting in insect, pest, and disease management. Various type of sensors and computer tools can be utilized in data recording and management of cropping systems, which ensure an opportunity for timely decisions. Digital tools and camera-assisted cropping systems can aid producers to monitor their crops remotely. IoT and smart farming techniques can help to simulate and predict the yield production under forecasted climatic conditions, and thus assist in decision making for various crop management practices, including irrigation, fertilizer, insecticide, and weedicide applications. We found that various neural networks and simulation models could aid in yield prediction for better decision support with an average simulation accuracy of up to 92%. Different numerical models and smart irrigation tools help to save energy use by reducing it up to 8%, whereas advanced irrigation helped in reducing the cost by 25.34% as compared to soil-moisture-based irrigation system. Several leaf diseases on various crops can be managed by using image processing techniques using a genetic algorithm with 90% precision accuracy. Establishment of indoor vertical farming systems worldwide, especially in the countries either lacking the supply of sufficient water for the crops or suffering an intense urbanization, is ultimately helping to increase yield as well as enhancing the metabolite profile of the plants. Hence, employing the advanced tools, a modern and smart agricultural farming system could be used to stabilize and enhance crop productivity by improving resource use efficiency of applied resources i.e., irrigation water and fertilizers.",https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0472/13/2/397/pdf?version=1675851149,

This will have significant implications for irrigation water management in agricultural systems in the future. Through qualitative and quantitative empirical research methods carried out on a case study on four Mediterranean farming systems located in Oristano, Italy, we sought to understand the relationship between farmers’ perceptions of climate change (i.e., increased temperature and decreased precipitation) and of present and future water availability for agriculture as forecasted by climatic and crop models. We also explored asymmetries between farmers’ perceptions and present and future climate change and water scenarios as well as factors influencing perceptions. Our hypotheses were that farmers’ perceptions are the main drivers of actual water management practices and that sustainable practices can emerge from learning spaces designed from the understanding of the gaps between perceptions and scientific evidences. Results showed that most farmers perceived that climate change is occurring or will occur in their area. They also perceived that there has been an increased temperature trend, but also increased precipitation. Therefore, they are convinced that they have and will have enough irrigation water for agriculture in the near future, while climate change projections foresee an increasing pressure on water resources in the Mediterranean region. Such results suggest the need for (i) irrigation management policies that take into account farmers’ perceptions in order to promote virtuous behaviors and improve irrigation water use efficiency; (ii) new, well-designed learning spaces to improve the understanding on climate change expectations in the near future in order to support effective adaptive responses at the farm and catchment scales.",https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4441/8/11/523/pdf?version=1478689289,

However, the impacts of these changes on GHG emissions have not been comprehensively assessed. While most earlier studies focused on the GHG emissions per unit area, recent research indicated that the yield-scaled impact may better reflect the reality. Through integrating the results from a meta-analysis, two multi-site field experiments and an expert survey, we quantify the integrated impacts of different practices on both area- and yield-scaled GHG emissions in China. Results from the expert survey showed that rice planting area has shifted northwards, and alternate water-saving (WS) irrigation has been applied in nearly 78% of Chinese rice paddy areas in both the rice nursery stage and post-transplanting period over the past five decades. The changes of these practices and replacement of new rice varieties have increased China’s rice yield by 131%. During the same period, cropping system adjustment, variety replacement, and implementation of WS irrigation have reduced total GHG emissions by 7%, 31%, and 42%, respectively. Also, the major decrease in GWP occurred prior to the 2000s, and the decreasing trend continued in the post-2000s period but at a slower rate. Our results have some limitations as these estimates ignore a number of important variations and interactions among management factors as well as climatic and edaphic conditions.

The irrigation sector is the largest consumer of water in the country, accounting for about 62% of water utilisation, but also losing 30–40%. Given the threat of drought and climate change, efficient irrigation systems have become a necessity, especially in the smallholder farming sector where most losses occur. Smallholder irrigation schemes (SIS) were developed to improve rural livelihoods through sustainable food production for food security and poverty alleviation, but these development objectives remain largely unfulfilled. The objectives of this review were to assess challenges facing SIS and explore opportunities for revitalising the schemes. The focus was on government policy and strategies to support smallholder farmers. A review of government policy showed that although the needs and interests of smallholder farmers are high on the national agenda, there is insufficient financial support to the sector, suggesting that smallholder agriculture is not really seen as a potential driver of the economy. The core focus of the government on repairing irrigation infrastructure while neglecting the soft components relating to capacity building has partly been blamed for the failure of SIS in South Africa. Capacity building is one of the missing links in smallholder irrigation development and many failures have been attributed to lack of adequately trained farmers and extension staff, particularly in irrigation water management. Land tenure insecurity has been singled out as a major institutional challenge leading to poor performance of irrigation schemes. The diversity of schemes means that different kinds of interventions are needed to respond to varying farmers’ needs, resources and agricultural contexts. These findings point to the need to balance the soft and hard components of the irrigation schemes for sustainability. It is therefore evident that the government needs to review its priorities in revitalisation of SIS.

Sometimes these sinkholes can cause extensive damage to infrastructure and homes. It has been suggested that agricultural practices, such as sprinkler irrigation methods used to protect crops, can increase the development of sinkholes, particularly when temperatures drop below freezing, causing groundwater levels to drop quickly during groundwater pumping. In the strawberry growing region, Dover/Plant City, Florida, the effects have caused water shortages resulting in dry- wells and ground subsidence through the development of sinkholes that can be costly to maintain and repair. In this study, we look at how frost-freeze events have affected West Central Florida over the past 25 years with detailed comparisons made between two cold-years (with severe frost-freeze events) and a warm year (no frost-freeze events). We analyzed the spatial and temporal correlation between strawberry farming freeze protection practices and the development of sinkholes/dry well complaints, and assessed the economic impact of such events from a water management perspective by evaluating the cost of repairing and drilling new wells and how these compared with using alternative crop-protection methods. We found that the spatial distribution of sinkholes was non-random during both frost-freeze events. A strong correlation between sinkhole occurrence and water extraction and minimum temperatures was found. Furthermore as temperatures fall below 41°F and water levels decrease by more than 20 ft, the number of sinkholes increase greatly (N >10). At this time alternative protection methods such as freeze-cloth are cost prohibitive in comparison to repairing dry wells.

So, it needs to be automated for proper yield and handled remotely for farmer safety. The aim of this study is to review the needs of soil moisture sensors in irrigation, sensor technology and their applications in irrigation scheduling and, discussing prospects. The review further discusses the literature of sensors remotely communicating with self-propelled sprinkler irrigation systems, distributed wireless sensor networks, sensors and integrated data management schemes and autonomous sprinkler control options. On board and field-distributed sensors can collect data necessary for real-time irrigation management decisions and transmit the information directly or through wireless networks to the main control panel or base computer. Communication systems such as cell phones, satellite radios, and internet-based systems are also available allowing the operator to query the main control panel or base computer from any location at any time. Selection of the communication system for remote access depends on local and regional topography and cost. Traditional irrigation systems may provide unnecessary irrigation to one part of a field while leading to a lack of irrigation in other parts. New sensors or remotely sensing capabilities are required to collect real time data for crop growth status and other parameters pertaining to weather, crop and soil to support intelligent and efficient irrigation management systems for agricultural processes. Further development of wireless sensor applications in agriculture is also necessary for increasing efficiency, productivity and profitability of farming operations.

This study examines a range of perspectives (from rural farmers to development experts) on the limited commercialization of rural agriculture in this region of Nepal and the potential approaches to promoting agricultural growth and commercialization among small landholders. An analysis of household surveys, key informant interviews, and focus group discussions in three wards of Kaski, Syangja, and Palpa districts of Nepal revealed that nearly one-third of farmers left their agricultural lands barren or only partly cultivated, and more than one-third were not motivated to engage in agricultural activities. This lack of motivation was found to be connected with limited or no access to irrigation water, poor production systems, a lack of access to markets, a low return on investment in agriculture, the low social status of farm-work, the incidence of crop infestations, and fear of production risks due to extreme climatic factors (such as low/high rainfall, droughts, etc.). Remittances related to outmigration were also found to be important factors limiting a farmer’s involvement in agriculture, which also creates labor shortages. This research confirms that, for agricultural production to be profitable and commercial, households need to receive qualified technical support to introduce new technologies, engage in markets, access input suppliers and service providers, and adopt high-value production crops and related techniques. Households that receive an income from government jobs, private sources, and remittances reported agriculture being a laborious and difficult task. Addressing these mediating factors along with the provision of effective crop insurance and subsides for the lower-income segments of the population, has the potential to (re)engage rural households in farming activities. Such an approach could provide a way to realize the government’s plans to commercialize smallholder farming.",https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0472/10/5/143/pdf?version=1588696015,

Several emerging problems, such as the exhausting nutrient pool in soil, deteriorating soil health, groundwater depletion, escalating production cost, labor scarcity, environmental pollution due to crop residue burning and enhanced greenhouse gas emissions, climatic vulnerabilities, and herbicide resistance in weed species, are a few major threats to its sustainability. To address these challenges, a wide range of sustainable intensification technologies have been developed to reduce the irrigation and labor requirements, tillage intensity, and straw burning. Awareness and capacity building of the stakeholders and policy matching/advocacy need to be prioritized to adopt time- and need-based strategies at the ground level to combat these challenges.

However, the attainment of food security in Southern African countries is affected by many factors, including adverse environmental conditions, pests and diseases. Scientists have been insistently looking for innovative strategies to optimize crop production and combat challenges militating against attainment of food security. In agriculture, strategies of increasing crop production include but not limited to improved crop varieties, farming practices, extension services, irrigation services, mechanization, information technology, use of fertilizers and agrochemicals. Equally important is genetic modification (GM) technology, which brings new prospects in addressing food security problems. Nonetheless, since the introduction of genetically modified crops (GMOs) three decades ago, it has been a topic of public discourse across the globe, conspicuously so in Southern African region. This is regardless of the evidence that planting GMOs positively influenced farmer’s incomes, economic access to food and increased tolerance of crops to various biotic and abiotic stresses.

The influence of the monsoon climate on the seasonal trends and anomalies of vegetation greenness is poorly understood in this area. Herein, we used the satellite-based Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) to investigate various spatiotemporal patterns in vegetation activity during summer and winter monsoon (SM and WM) seasons and among irrigated croplands (IC), rainfed croplands (RC), and natural vegetation (NV) areas during 1982–2013. Seasonal NDVI variations with climatic factors (precipitation and temperature) and land use and cover changes (LUCC) have also been investigated. This study demonstrates that the seasonal dynamics of vegetation could improve the detailed understanding of vegetation productivity over the region. We found distinct greenness trends between two monsoon seasons and among the major land use/cover classes. Winter monsoons contributed greater variability to the overall vegetation dynamics of SA. Major greening occurred due to the increased productivity over irrigated croplands during the winter monsoon season; meanwhile, browning trends were prominent over NV areas during the same season. Maximum temperatures had been increasing tremendously during the WM season; however, the precipitation trend was not significant over SA. Both the climate variability and LUCC revealed coupled effects on the long term NDVI trends in NV areas, especially in the hilly regions, whereas anthropogenic activities (agricultural advancements) played a pivotal role in the rest of the area.

In central Asia, ACL is transmitted mainly by the sandfly Phlebotomus sergenti in urban or periurban environments (5). Zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis (ZCL), caused by L. major, occurs autochthonously in Afghanistan, but little is known about its regional and seasonal distribution or other disease characteristics (6,7). Recently, cases have been reported in troops deployed to the Mazar-e Sharif area: 19 cases among the British military contingent in 2004, 186 among Dutch troops in 2005 (overall attack rate 20.9%), and 14 among German troops in 2005 (8). This yet-undescribed L. major variant is highly aggressive, often disseminates and causes nodular lymphangitis, and is associated with delayed or poor response to treatment with sodium stibogluconate or miltefosine. Regional epidemiologic reports, when available from Afghan or international health authorities, usually mention cutaneous leishmaniasis cases without further elaboration. To evaluate the current threat and specific epidemiology of cutaneous leishmaniasis in Mazar-e Sharif, medical entomologic and epidemiologic field investigations were conducted in June and October 2005. Results show that ZCL, ACL, and visceral leishmaniasis (VL) are endemic to Mazar-e Sharif. Data from patients seeking treatment from March 21, 2004, through March 20, 2005, at the Balkh Province Leishmaniasis Center, Mazar-e Sharif, showed that of 3,958 cases, 3,782 (95.5%) were ZCL, 174 (4.4%) were ACL, and 2 (0.05%) were VL; the number of unreported cases during this time is unknown. A sharp increase (4.4- to 5.4-fold) in ZCL cases was found when data from July 21 through August 20 and from August 21 through September 20, 2004, (30 and 169 cases, respectively) were compared with data for the same periods in 2005 (163 and 744 cases, respectively). ZCL chiefly affects farmers, nomads, and refugees. By sex, cases occurred in 1,991 (52.6%) male and 1,791 (47.4%) female patients. By age group, the rate for ZCL in young children was similar to that for other age groups: 1,167 (30.9%) cases in children 15 years of age. In the leishmaniasis center, cutaneous infections are confirmed by seeing Leishmania parasites in Giemsa-stained smears obtained directly from skin lesions. Although sporadically confirmed by culture and PCR, ZCL and ACL are usually differentiated by specific clinical aspects, especially of skin lesions: dry lesions characterize urban ACL; wet lesions, often superinfected and disseminating, characterize rural ZCL. In terms of seasonal patterns in Mazar-e Sharif, ZCL peaks in mid-October and most ACL cases occur during mid-February (Figure). Observations at the leishmaniasis center in Mazar-e Sharif indicate that the incubation period for ACL is 4–6 weeks (associated with the cold, wet season) and that for ZCL is 8–12 weeks (associated with the hot, dry season). The minimum incubation period of ZCL in German and Dutch patients was 7 weeks, a figure derived from the known period of troop deployment rather than from hospital records. Figure Seasonal distribution pattern of zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis (panel A) and anthroponotic cutaneous leishmaniasis (panel B) cases registered in the Balkh Province Leishmaniasis Center, Mazar-e Sharif, Afghanistan, March 21, 2004, through March 20, ... The Mazar-e Sharif area, especially near the airfield, is semidesert, although extensive farming of seasonal crops is possible because of irrigation systems built in the 1980s. Irrigation canals are usually several kilometers long and 1.5–2 m deep and wide. Earth removed during canal construction is deposited as embankments that attract large numbers of the great gerbil, Rhombomys opimus, the main animal reservoir of L. major (6). Our studies showed an average of 3,380 R. opimus burrows per hectare, the highest density yet recorded, far exceeding the previous record of >1,000 rodent burrows per hectare in nearby Turkmenistan (9). Much lower R. opimus population densities were found at the Sakhi refugee camp, in the suburbs of Mazar-e Sharif, where Sherman box trapping for 18 nights was unsuccessful. Gerbil species were identified by photographs of live gerbils and by capture of 2. Both captured animals had positive results for L. major by microscopy and PCR. Because human enhancement of R. opimus habitat favors high infestations, the Mazar-e Sharif outbreak is an example of an anthropogenically induced emerging zoonosis. Sandfly surveillance was conducted in October 2005 by using unbaited CDC light traps (John Hock Co., Gainesville, FL, USA) and sticky traps placed in areas that were heavily infested with R. opimus. Phlebotomus papatasi, the principal vector of ZCL (7), was caught at low densities only, because of the cold night temperatures in October. Our data suggest that foci of high-density enzootic ZCL occur in northern Afghanistan, especially in the Mazar-e Sharif area. ACL may also pose future problems because of its epidemic urban transmission potential (10). Effective disease surveillance and preventive measures should be promptly implemented to mitigate these health threats.",https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/12/10/pdfs/06-0076.pdf,

This research investigates the changes in precipitation and surface air temperature indices in the seven irrigation zones of Punjab Province during the last 50 years; this province is a very important region in Pakistan in terms of agriculture and irrigated farming. The reliability of the data was examined using double mass curve and autocorrelation analysis. The magnitude and significance of the precipitation and temperature were visualized by various statistical methods. The stations’ trends were spatially distributed to better understand climatic variability across the elevation gradient of the study region. The results showed a significant warming trend in annual Tmin (minimum temperature) and Tmean (mean temperature) in different irrigation zones. However, Tmax (maximum temperature) had insignificant variations except in the high elevation Thal zone. Moreover, the rate of Tmin increased faster than that of Tmax, resulting in a reduction in the diurnal temperature range (DTR). On a seasonal scale, warming was more pronounced during spring, followed by that in winter and autumn. However, the summer season exhibited insignificant negative trends in most of the zones and gauges, except in the higher-altitude Thal zone. Overall, Bahawalpur and Faisalabad are the zones most vulnerable to warming annually and in the spring, respectively. Furthermore, the elevation-dependent trend (EDT) indicated larger increments in Tmax for higher-elevation (above 500 m a.s.l.) stations, compared to the lower-elevation ones, on both annual and seasonal scales. In contrast, the Tmin showed opposite trends at higher- and lower-elevation stations, while a moderate increase was witnessed in Tmean trends from lower to higher altitude over the study region. An increasing trend in DTR was observed at higher elevation, while a decreasing trend was noticed at the lower-elevation stations. The analysis of precipitation data indicated wide variability over the entire region during the study period. Most previous studies reported no change or a decreasing trend in precipitation in this region. Conversely, our findings indicated the cumulative increase in annual and autumn precipitation amounts at zonal and regional level. However, EDT analysis identified the decrease in precipitation amounts at higher elevation (above 1000 m a.s.l.) and increase at the lower-elevation stations. Overall, our findings revealed unprecedented evidence of regional climate change from the perspectives of seasonal warming and variations in precipitation and temperature extremes (Tmax and Tmin) particularly at higher-elevation sites, resulting in a variability of the DTR, which could have a significant influence on water resources and on the phenology of vegetation and crops at zonal and station level in Punjab.",https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4441/11/9/1916/pdf?version=1568970213,

We analyzed climate data from the 1950’s to the present, including daily and aggregated rainfall and temperature variability, trends and extremes. We also examined farmer perceptions of climate, particularly with what was expected and what was actually observed. Field data was collected through: (i) a semi-structured survey administered to 478 head households; (ii) from focus groups through discussion and consultation with local stakeholders by using a risk matrix.  The main agro-climatic risks for farmers in these countries are: Increasing maximum and minimum temperatures; high rainfall variability; and, extreme droughts and floods. We were able to work with communities to identify and prioritize authentic climate change adaptation measures that were deemed to be both strategic and complementary to prudent natural resource management and enhanced agricultural production. Identified innovative adaptation practices that may be up-scaled include: expanding irrigation systems, adjusting crop planting times to suit localized weather and climate forecasts, plant breeding to establish more heat-stress tolerant crops and associated agroforestry. In dryland rainfall systems, it was acknowledged there is a need for greater reliance on water-stress tolerant crops, better soil and water conservation techniques associated with broad catchment management and agroforestry, and improving soil management through prudent fertilizers in sorghum crops.

Weed and GIS survey of 60 cereal and pulse fields in Morocco are combined with crop sampling for stable isotope analysis to frame assessment of agricultural labour intensity in terms of manuring, irrigation, tillage and hand-weeding. Under low management intensity weed variation primarily reflects geographical differences, whereas under high management intensity fields in disparate regions have similar weed flora. Manured and irrigated oasis barley fields are clearly discriminated from less intensively manured rain-fed barley terraces in southern Morocco; when fields in northern and southern Morocco are considered together, climatic differences are superimposed on the agronomic intensity gradient. Barley δ13C and δ15N values clearly distinguish among the Moroccan regimes. An integrated approach combines crop isotope values with weed ecological discrimination of low- and high-intensity regimes across multiple studies (in southern Morocco and southern Europe). Analysis of archaeobotanical samples from EBA Tell Brak, Syria suggests that this early city was sustained through extensive (low-intensity, large-scale) cereal farming.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/14614103.2016.1261217?needAccess=true,

In response, farmers engage in some risk management strategies which may have social and economic implications not only on the farming households in particular, but the entire economy. This study identified the sources of risk and the management strategies employed by the food crop farmers. A two-stage sampling procedure was used in the collection of primary data. The first stage involved a random selection of 30 farming communities from the three agroecological zones of the state’s Agricultural Development Programme (ADP) namely Ife-Ijesa, Osogbo and Iwo zones. The second stage involved a random selection of food crop farmers from each of the villages with probability proportionate to size of each farming community. Data from 165 respondents were used for the analysis. Primary data collected included sources of risk, other environmental factors and management strategies employed. Secondary data were also obtained from Osun State Agricultural Development Programme (OSSADEP) records to complement the primary data. The data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and composite analysis. Sources of risk in the last three years were market failure, 54.5%; price fluctuation, 46.1%; drought, 32.7%; pest and diseases attack, 33.9% and erratic rainfall, 39.4%. Majority of the food crop farmers in the study area were in the medium risk category. The mean value of 2.68 (approximately 3.0) implies that an average food crop farmer experienced up to three different sources of risk in the study area. Risk management strategies available to the farmers were extension services, 67.3%; access to fertilizer, 41.2%; mixed cropping/farming, 79.3%; cooperative society 54.5%, borrowing of money, 73.0% and off farm-work, 69.7%. Attention should be shifted towards protection of farmers against market failure and price distortion or fluctuations as these, among others could impair the growth potential of these farmers. Investment in irrigation projects by the government would also save the farmers from drought and erratic rainfall while farmers are encouraged to benefit from the services of the agricultural insurance industry.",https://www.ajol.info/index.php/ajfand/article/download/47687/34062,

This paper reviewed that application of balanced nutrients under optimum moisture availability in different soil types is an important crop management strategy, which may help maximizing crop yield and quality. Also, lack of optimum nutrients and moisture in the soil has been the major bottlenecks of garlic production and productivity; since the crop has a very shallow root system that requires frequent irrigation and fertilization with different types of fertilizers under various soil types. Low soil fertility is one of the principal and pervasive constraints to garlic production in Ethiopia; thus, there are differences among soil types in yielding ability under different nutrients and soil characteristics. Most smallholder farmers in Ethiopia appreciate the value of fertilizers, but they are seldom able to apply them at the recommended rates and at the appropriate time according to the soil characteristics. These are because of high cost, lack of credit, delivery delays, and low and variable returns. In addition, the traditional organic inputs, crop residues and animal manures, identified that it cannot meet crop nutrient demand over large areas because of the limited quantities available, the low nutrient content of the materials, and the high labor demands for processing and application. However, there was felt that could exist an opportunity to increase garlic crop yields through identification/selection of soil type and balanced nutrients application or searching for other nutrients sources beyond Urea and Diammonium phosphate especially in Ethiopian condition. Therefore, the integrated use of both the organic and inorganic fertilizers continuum inputs was felt the best option to increase both yield potential and quality of garlic crop and environment-friendly sustainable farming systems and increase of profit margins for growers.",http://jas.sljol.info/articles/10.4038/jas.v11i3.8172/galley/6201/download/,

The study specifically presents the results of climate change impacts under rainfed conditions for maize, sorghum and sunflower using soil-water-crop model simulations, integrated based on daily inputs of rainfall and evapotranspiration disaggregated from GCM scenarios. The research targets a vast farming region dominated by heavy clay soils where rainfed agriculture is a dominant practice. The potential for improving soil water productivity and improved water harvesting have been explored as ways of climate change mitigation and adaptation measures. This can be utilized to explore and design appropriate conservation agriculture and adaptation practices in similar agro-ecological environments, and create opportunities for outscaling for much wider areas.

The study identified the major adaptation practices that are adopted by farmers to cope with the impacts of climate change and using available on-farm technologies. A total of 143 smallholder farmers were sampled and interviewed using field based questionnaires, field observations, and key informant interviews. Data was cleaned, entered and analysed using SPSS and Stata software for descriptive statistics. Thereafter, a Multinomial logistic regression model was used to assess the drivers of farmers’ choice for adaptation practices, factors influencing the choice of adaptation, and barriers. The major adaptation practices that were identified included; use of different crop varieties, tree planting, soil and water conservation, early and late planting, and furrow irrigation. Discrete choice model results indicated the age of the household head, experience in farming, household size, climate change shocks, land size, use of agricultural inputs, landscape position (location), and crop yield varied significantly (p > 0.05), which influenced farmers’ choice of climate change adaptation practices. The main barriers to adaptation included inadequate information on adaptation methods and financial constraints, leading us to conclude that contextual adaptation practices are more desirable for adoption to farmers.

The impact of age of seedlings and plant spacing were also assessed. AWDI using the proposed irrigation schedule of 10 wet days alternated with 10 dry days used less water (29% less water) without significant reduction in grain yield (7.2 t/h) compared with conventional irrigation (7.8 t/h). Water Productivity Index was significantly higher in all sub-plots in AWDI treatments. WPI was 1.7 kg/m 3 in AWDI treatments compared to 1.3 kg/m 3 in conventional water management. Additional significant results from AWDI treatment included reduced pest and disease incidence, shortened crop cycle, and reduced lodging. However, slightly higher grain yields were observed in all sub-plots of the conventional irrigation treatment than were observed in the same combinations under AWDI.

The surrounding background, such as weeds, trees, and stones, can interfere with crop appearance and increase the difficulty of detection. The detection accuracy of crop rows is also impacted by different growth stages, environmental conditions, curves, and occlusion. Therefore, appropriate sensors and multiple adaptable models are required to achieve high-precision crop row detection. This paper presents a comprehensive review of the methods and applications related to crop row detection for agricultural machinery navigation. Particular attention has been paid to the sensors and systems used for crop row detection to improve their perception and detection capabilities. The advantages and disadvantages of current mainstream crop row detection methods, including various traditional methods and deep learning frameworks, are also discussed and summarized.

Many studies have shown the interest of recent satellite missions as suitable tools for agricultural surveys. Nevertheless, they are not predictive methods. A system able to detect summer crops as early as possible is important in order to obtain valuable information for a better water management strategy. The detection of summer crops before the beginning of the irrigation period is therefore our objective. The study area is located near Toulouse (southwestern France), and is a region of mixed farming with a wide variety of irrigated and non-irrigated crops. Using the reference data for the years concerned, a set of fixed thresholds are applied to a vegetation index (the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, NDVI) for each agricultural season of multi-spectral satellite optical imagery acquired at decametric spatial resolutions from 2006 to 2013. The performance (i.e., accuracy) is contrasted according to the agricultural practices, the development states of the different crops and the number of acquisition dates (one to three in the results presented here). The detection of summer crops reaches 64% to 88% with a single date, 80% to 88% with two dates and 90% to 99% with three dates.

This salinisation occurs in both irrigated and rain-fed agricultural zones with the highest proportions in the arid and semi-arid environments. Livestock can play an important role in the management and rehabilitation of this land. There are a range of plants that grow in saline soils and these have been used as animal feed. In many situations, animal production has been poor as a result of low edible biomass production, low nutritive value, depressed appetite, or a reduction in efficiency of energy use. Feeding systems are proposed that maximise the feeding value of plants growing on saline land and integrate their use with other feed resources available within mixed livestock and crop farming systems. Salt-tolerant pastures, particularly the chenopod shrubs, have moderate digestible energy and high crude protein. For this reason they represent a good supplement for poor quality pastures and crop residues. The use of salt-tolerant pasture systems not only provides feed for livestock but also may act as a bio-drain to lower saline water tables and improve the soil for growth of alternative less salt tolerant plants. In the longer term there are opportunities to identify and select more appropriate plants and animals for saline agriculture.",https://www.animbiosci.org/upload/pdf/18_45.pdf,

These transformations have been, however, largely misestimated by the ten-year agricultural plans designed at the provincial levels, on the predictions of which, though, most of the large-scale investments (irrigation infrastructures, protection against flooding or salinity intrusion, and so on) are normally planned. This situation raises the question of how to explain the divergence between the predictions used as a basis for these plans and the actual situation. Answering it could, as a matter of fact, offer some insights on the dynamics at play and hopefully allow designing them more accurately. The dynamics of land-use change at a scale of a region results from the interactions between heterogeneous actors and factors at different scales, among them institutional policies, individual farming choices, land-cover and environmental changes, economic conditions, social dynamics, just to name a few. Understanding its evolution, for example, in this case, to better support agricultural planning, therefore requires the use of models that can represent the individual contributions of each actor or factor, and of course their interactions. We address this question through the design of an integrated hybrid model of land-use change in a specific and carefully chosen case study, which relies on the central hypothesis that the main force driving land-use change is actually the individual choices made by farmers at their local level. Farmers are the actors who decide (or not) to switch from one culture to another and the shifts observed at more global levels (village, district, province, region) are considered, in this model, as a consequence of the aggregation of these individual d",https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fenvs.2016.00019/pdf,

It is widely accepted that organic (O) fertilizers may deal with pressing challenges facing modern agriculture, even if farmers need to improve their knowledge for applying in fertilization programs. A meta-analysis approach has been adopted to evaluate the effects on soil organic carbon (SOC) and crop yield of O fertilizers, applied alone or in combination with mineral fertilizers (MO) under conventional (CT), reduced (RT), and no-tillage (NT) regimes. The analysis was performed in different climatic conditions, soil properties, crop species, and irrigation management. Organic fertilizers have a positive influence in increasing SOC compared with M (on average 12.9%), even if high values were observed under NT (20.6%). The results highlighted the need for flexible and environment-specific systems when considering organic fertilization subjected to different tillage regimes. Similarly, MO application showed a better crop yield response in CT and RT under coarse soils when compared with M fertilizer applied alone (on average 13.4 and 12.7%, respectively), while in medium-textured soils, CT and RT yielded better than NT under O fertilizers (9.5 and 11.2 vs. 2.5%, respectively). Among the crop species, legumes performed better when O fertilizers were adopted than M fertilizers (on average 15.2%), while among the other crop species, few differences were detected among the fertilization programs.

Therefore, greenhouse (GH) agriculture can be developed to succeed in dealing with the water scarcity and provide sufficient sources of agricultural products as a sustainable solution. These indoor agriculture facilities, which are enclosed by transparent covers, can produce different sources of fruits and vegetables, using a controlled amount of water. By reducing the exchange rate of air with the outside environment, which is known as the confinement effects, greenhouses generate a suitable environment for the plants to grow under transparent covers to trap the sunlight. This raises the inside temperature above the maximum threshold levels, especially within the warm season, due to the high solar radiation intensity, having an adverse influence on the microclimate conditions and consequently the crop growth.

Early ceremonies for the Emperor and the gods used various mixes of plant foods. Overly generalizing translations of texts from as early as the 13th century led to privileging rice over the other grains. In the process of reviewing rice in Japanese history, von Verschuer provides a dense, statisticspacked work drawing on every line of evidence from archaeology and ethnography to poetry and folksong. Japanese of premodern times ate, drank, and breathed poetry, and most of it used images from nature and agriculture. Almost every crop and cultivation process is mentioned somewhere, often in short poems that lament the writer’s situation in a rural setting far from his or her true love. Von Verschuer covers every aspect of agriculture in exhaustive detail, from the latest archaeological investigations to modern swiddening. Apparently the practice of swiddening was once important and widespread, but survives now only as re-enactments of past practices for tourists. She is particularly detailed on medieval agriculture: technology, crops, yields, milling and preparation, social contexts, everything. One can learn when cotton was introduced (799 CE), how rice was taken off the ear (by pulling sheaves between chopsticks—a slow and laborious process), and which wild plants were gathered. The book is extremely dense with factual The author summarizes the aim of this book as “to situate irrigated rice cultivation in the overall context of the crops grown in premodern Japan. We have put forward a number of facts regarding the coexistence of rice growing and dry cereal cultivation, the practice of swidden farming, the gathering of plant foods, the relative proportion of cultivated and wild plants in the diet, and finally the cultural portrayal of rice and the other cereals” (296). The role of rice in Japan has been controversial. In general, the Japanese have privileged its importance, and the importance of irrigation. They have considered rice as Japan’s staple, and even as Japan’s “self” (Ohnuki-Tierney 1993, a work not cited by von Verschuer). A long-standing countercurrent has pointed out that many other foods were important over time, notably foxtail millet (Setaria italica), common millet (Panicum miliaceum), barnyard millet (Echinochloa crus-galli), wheat, barley, buckwheat, and soybeans. A vast number of roots, tubers, leaves, seeds, nuts, fruits, and other products also contributed. Animal food was always rare, except for fish along coasts. This counter-narrative has been well known for some time in the west, even in some popular works (e.g., Frédéric 1973), but most people, Japanese and western, likely continue to think of Japan as rice-dependent. Charlotte von Verschuer has analyzed the evidence and found that rice has been important since the dawn of Japanese civilization, but provided only about one-quarter of the total food supply depending on the period, region, and conditions.

The present study aimed at assessing the effects of early drought stress on ten elite sorghum varieties tested over two years (2018–2019) at the National Agronomic Research Centre (CNRA) of Bambey (Senegal, West Africa). Two different water regimes (well-watered and drought stress) were applied during the dry season. Water stress was applied by withholding irrigation 25 days after sowing for one month, followed by optimal irrigation until maturity. Soil moisture measurements were performed and allowed to follow the level of stress (down to a fraction of transpirable soil water (FTSW) of 0.30 at the end of stress). An agro-physio-morphological monitoring was carried out during the experiment. Results showed highly significant effects of early drought stress in sorghum plants growth by decreasing leaf appearance, biomass, height but also yield set up. The combined analysis of variance revealed highly significant differences (p ≤ 0.01) between varieties in the different environments for most characters. Under water deficit, the variability was less strong on leaf appearance and plant height at the end of stress. The adaptation responses were related to the capacity of varieties to grow up fast and complete their cycle rather, increase the dead leaves weight, reduce photosynthesis rate, stomatal conductance, leaf transpiration and increase the roots length density. However, varieties V1, V2, V8 and V9 showed promising behavior under stress and could be suitable for further application in West Africa for sorghum breeding and farming.",https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4395/11/3/443/pdf?version=1614744310,

The efforts to achieve permanent self-sufficiency are challenged by (i) an increase in the population of approximately 3.4 million people each year, (ii) conversion of paddy field to non-agricultural land at a rate of about 96,500 ha year-1, while the rate of paddy field expansion is only about 20,000-30,000 ha year-1, and (iii) global climate change which causes the increase in intensity and frequency of extreme climatic events in the forms of droughts, floods, landslides, that in turns increase the incident of pest/disease attacks. Efforts and strategies are required to overcome them through first, intensification by applying technological innovations on 4 million ha of existing fully irrigated rice fields, 4.1 million ha of sub-optimal rice fields (rainfed, simple irrigation, swampland) with improved irrigation and drainage systems, balanced fertilization, improved varieties, and increased Harvesting Index from 1 to 1.5. Second, control of land conversion by establishing multi-stakeholder agreements, cooperation among related ministerials/institutionals, local governments, private sectors and communities to raise awareness of the risk of land conversion to food security, social, economic and political stability.Third, expansion of rice farming areas into young oil palm (5.1 million ha), rubber (0.54 million ha), as well as on coconut (2.15 million ha) plantations. Shade tolerant varieties are now available for upland rice, maize and soybeans to support this effort. Fourth, expansion of new agricultural areas for food crops on potential lands in swamp land (tidal swamp lands, fresh water swamp land and peat land), as well as on non swamp wetlands for irrigated and rain-fed rice fields, and on upland with slopes of <15% for annual upland crops. These four approaches are believed to enable achievement of sustainable food self-sufficiency. ",http://ejurnal.litbang.pertanian.go.id/index.php/jsl/article/download/8187/6987,

On the other hand, global wheat productivity is greatly affected due to drought and low fertility of soil under arid and semi-arid regions. Application of supplementary irrigation and plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) has been suggested as sustainable measures to combat drought stress and to improve soil fertility and, hence, crop yield. This research was undertaken to study the effect of supplementary irrigation together with a combination of various PGPR on the growth and yield of two wheat cultivars, namely Sardari and Sirvan. The results of variance analysis (mean of squares) showed that the effect of irrigation, cultivar, and irrigation and biofertilizer and irrigation on height, spike length, seed/spike, and numbers of spikes/m2, 1000-seed weight, and grain yield were significant at 1% probability level. The effect of cultivar and irrigation interactions showed that the highest grain yield was obtained in a treatment with two additional irrigations in Sirvan cultivar (5015.0 kg/ha) and Sardari (4838.9 kg/ha) as compared to the 3598 kg/ha and 3598.3 kg/h grain yield in Sirvan and Sardari cultivars with similar treatment, but without irrigation, i.e., dryland farming. Drought conditions significantly affected the wheat grain yield while supplementary irrigation resulted in 39.38% and 34.48% higher yields in Sirvan and Sardari cultivars.",https://www.mdpi.com/2223-7747/10/4/811/pdf?version=1619061075,

Using 1026 household-level cross-section data, this study adopts a technology flexible stochastic frontier approach to examine agricultural TE of large-scale irrigation users, small-scale irrigation users and non-user farmers in Ethiopia. The results indicate that, due to poor extension services and old-style agronomic practices, the mean TE of farmers is very low (44.33%), implying that there is a wider room for increasing crop production in the study areas through increasing the TE of smallholder farmers without additional investment in novel agricultural technologies. Results also show that large-scale irrigation user farmers (21.05%) are less technically efficient than small-scale irrigation user farmers (60.29%).

The spatial distribution of the onset time of rains, the length of the Yala and the Maha seasons and the number of dry weeks within seasons were determined using weekly rainfall data from 36 rainfall stations in the Dry and Intermediate Zones. Based on the seasonal rainfall characteristics, the cropping calendars for rice crops for each agro-ecological region (AER) were prepared. This study discloses a high spatial variability of the onset time of both the Yala and Maha seasons. Many AERs in the Dry Zone and some AERs in the Intermediate Zone do not have a distinct Yala season. The Yala rains in the Dry Zone are highly variable and the most probable length of the season may not exceed four weeks from the onset time. During the Maha season, there is enough rain water for paddy cultivation. The proposed cropping calendars can be used as a tool in farming activities from the land preparation to harvesting. Such information could assist to reduce the amount of irrigation water required and the frequency of water issued from the tanks in the respective regions without a wide margin of errors. It can also be used as a decision support tool in planning rainfed upland agricultural systems as well. The identification of dry periods within a season is necessary for the farmers to be aware and adapt to recent advanced technologies to reduce the water use for rice cultivation. Periodical checking and revision of the cropping calendars with future climate predictions are recommended.

In the changing climate, farmers in developing countries must adopt technologies and farming practices such as precision agriculture (PA). PA-based approaches enable farmers to cope with frequent and intensified droughts and heatwaves, optimising yields, increasing efficiencies, and reducing operational costs. Biophysical parameters such as Leaf Area Index (LAI), Leaf Chlorophyll Content (LCab), and Canopy Chlorophyll Content (CCC) are essential for characterising field-level spatial variability and thus are necessary for enabling variable rate application technologies, precision irrigation, and crop monitoring. Moreover, robust machine learning algorithms offer prospects for improving the estimation of biophysical parameters due to their capability to deal with non-linear data, small samples, and noisy variables. This study compared the predictive performance of sparse Partial Least Squares (sPLS), Random Forest (RF), and Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM) for estimating LAI, LCab, and CCC with Sentinel-2 imagery in Bothaville, South Africa and identified, using variable importance measures, the most influential bands for estimating crop biophysical parameters. The results showed that RF was superior in estimating all three biophysical parameters, followed by GBM which was better in estimating LAI and CCC, but not LCab, where sPLS was relatively better. Since all biophysical parameters could be achieved with RF, it can be considered a good contender for operationalisation. Overall, the findings in this study are significant for future biophysical product development using RF to reduce reliance on many algorithms for specific parameters, thus facilitating the rapid extraction of actionable information to support PA and crop monitoring activities.",https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/13/21/4314/pdf?version=1635605669,

Rice farmers have also responded to perceived climate risks with strategies believed to be climate-smart. Farmers’ perception of climate risks is an important first step of determining any action to be taken to counteract the negative effects of climate change on agriculture. Studies on the link between perceived climate risks and farmers’ response strategies are increasing. However, there are limited studies on the determinants of rice farmers’ perception of climate events. The paper therefore examined climate change perception and uptake of climate-smart agriculture in rice production in Ebonyi State, Nigeria using cross-sectional data from 347 rice farmers in an important rice-producing area in Nigeria. Principal component analysis, multivariate probit regression model and descriptive statistics were adopted for data analysis. Perceived climate events include increased rainfall intensity, prolonged dry seasons, frequent floods, rising temperature, severe windstorms, unpredictable rainfall pattern and distribution, late onset rain, and early cessation of rain. Farmers’ socioeconomic, farm and institutional characteristics influenced their perception of climate change. Additionally, rice farmers used a variety of climate-smart practices and technologies to respond to the perceived climate events. Such climate-smart practices include planting improved rice varieties, insurance, planting different crops, livelihood diversification, soil and water conservation techniques, adjusting planting and harvesting dates, irrigation, reliance on climate information and forecasts, planting on the nursery, appropriate application of fertilizer and efficient and effective use of pesticides. These climate-smart agricultural measures were further delineated into five broad packages using principal component analysis. These packages include crop and land management practices, climate-based services and irrigation, livelihood diversification and soil fertility management, efficient and effective use of pesticide and planting on the nursery. High fertilizer costs, lack of access to inputs, insufficient land, insufficient capital, pests and diseases, floods, scorching sun, high labour cost, insufficient climate information, and poor extension services were the barriers to uptake of climate-smart agriculture in rice production. Rice farmers should be supported to implement climate-smart agriculture in rice production in order to achieve the objectives of increased rice productivity and income, food security, climate resilience and mitigation.",https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4433/12/11/1503/pdf?version=1636980741,

While the life cycle foreground inventory was based on a combination of experimental and modeling datasets, the life cycle background inventory was compiled with commercially available data packages augmented with Chinese electricity mix data. The life cycle impact analyses were based on the characterization factors from state-of-art life cycle impact assessment models. The analyses indicated that the life cycle global warming impacts of the crop systems ranged from 0.37 to 0.64 kg CO2-eq/kg grain, with reclaimed water irrigated soybean and ground water irrigated wheat exhibiting, respectively, the lowest and highest global warming impacts. Irrigation, farming equipment operation, on-field emissions and fertilizer production ranked as top contributors to the life cycle impacts for corn, soybean, and wheat. The comparative analyses of irrigation sources suggested that significant environmental tradeoffs existed. Replacing groundwater with reclaimed water as the irrigation source significantly decreased life cycle global warming, acidification, ozone depletion, smog formation, and respiratory impacts of corn, soybean and wheat systems.

These were in descending order of importance: irrigation availability > farm labour > crop seasonality > crop damage (climatic) > land holding > crop damage (wildlife) > crop damage (diseases and pests). The most important consequences of climate change impacts were the drying of irrigation sources (4.35) and crop losses due to weather events (4.10), whereas land fallowing, the occurrence of flood and soil erosion, weed pressure and changes in cropping pattern (with mean ratings of 2.53–3.03) experienced lesser consequences. The extreme weather events, such as untimely rains, drought and windstorms, were rated as the ‘most common’ to ‘common’ occurrences, thus inflicting a crop loss of 1–19%.

This study was conducted under a program entitled “Agriculture Mechanization, Agro-Processing, Value addition and Export Market Development in Thailand and Vietnam from 1–14 November, 20I9” from the Ministry of Agriculture, Bangladesh. In all three distinct nations, farming activities represent a significant area of activity and remains the biggest wellspring of agricultural business. About 10.5% of Thailand’s, 21.5% of Vietnam’s, and 14.23% of Bangladesh’s GDP come from agriculture. For sustainable development, it is essential to modernize agriculture through the mechanization of its operations, which is therefore inevitable in the studied countries. Thailand’s government started mechanization in 1891 with the import of steam-powered tractor and rotary hoes. Since then the country has witnessed several milestones in the course of mechanization development. The focal plain agro-ecological zone of the state is the maximum and almost fully modernized area. As of now, there are two methods of practicing farming apparatus use: as a proprietor and/or through custom renting provision which coincides with Vietnam and Bangladesh. Historically, mechanization patterns in Vietnam can been described by tillage machinery with associated implement equipment use preceding 1975. This was non-linear, followed by a decreasing trend during the 80s prior to recovery during the 90s, with significant disparities in implementation status across the areas. In 2018, the number of tillage implements and harvesters was boosted about 1.6 and 25.6 times, respectively compared with 2006. The percentage of machinery use in soil tillage operation is 80% of the whole territory of cultivable land in Vietnam, compared to about 90% in Bangladesh and 100% in Thailand. Mechanization in Bangladesh started before independence with the importation of 2-wheel tractors and irrigation pumps in the last part of the 1960s as part of ‘Green Revolution’ activities. To continue this momentum, the Bangladesh Government permitted the continuation of agricultural machinery importation after later autonomy. Machinery use in different agricultural activities has increased in recent years in the areas of irrigation, land preparation, intercultural operation, and threshing. Though its degree of advancement is by and large still quite low contrasted with other South Asian nations, it is noticeable that the most recent two decades, the pace of mechanization has increased rapidly with the increase of mechanical power use in farm activities. The use of farm machinery in rice cultivation has been the most amazing when contrasted with different crops in these three nations.

Waste-water ponds, marshes, and irrigated fields associated with these agricultural activities provide abundant larval habitats for C. sonorensis midges, in addition to those sites that exist in the natural environment. Within this region, C. sonorensis is an important vector of bluetongue (BTV) and related viruses that adversely affect the international trade and movement of livestock, the economics of livestock production, and animal welfare. To characterize the seasonal dynamics of immature and adult C. sonorensis populations, abundance was monitored intensively on two dairy farms in the Sacramento Valley from August 2012– to July 2013. Adults were sampled every two weeks for 52 weeks by trapping (CDC style traps without light and baited with dry-ice) along N-S and E-W transects on each farm. One farm had large operational waste-water lagoons, whereas the lagoon on the other farm was drained and remained dry during the study. Spring emergence and seasonal abundance of adult C. sonorensis on both farms coincided with rising vernal temperature. Paradoxically, the abundance of midges on the farm without a functioning waste-water lagoon was increased as compared to abundance on the farm with a waste-water lagoon system, indicating that this infrastructure may not serve as the sole, or even the primary larval habitat. Adult midges disappeared from both farms from late November until May; however, low numbers of parous female midges were detected in traps set during daylight in the inter-seasonal winter period. This latter finding is especially critical as it provides a potential mechanism for the “overwintering” of BTV in temperate regions such as northern CA.

Traditional irrigation methods used in rice farming often result in great water loss. New water-saving methods are urgently needed to reduce water consumption. Three field and pot experiments were conducted to evaluate the furrow irrigation (FI) system to improve water use efficiency (WUE) and production of direct sowing rice in southern China. Compared to the conventional irrigation (CI) system (continuous flooding irrigation), for every square hectometer of rice field, the FI system reduced water use by 3130 m3, or 48.1%, and increased grain production by 13.9% for an early cultivar. For a late cultivar, the FI system reduced water use by 2655 m3, or 40.6%, and an increase of grain production by 12.1%. The improved WUE in the FI system is attributed to (1) a significant reduction of irrigation rate, seepage, evaporation, and evapotranspiration; (2) a significant reduction in the reduced materials, such as ferrous ion (Fe2+), and therefore an increase in the vitality of the root system, evident by the increases in the number of white roots by 32.62%, and decreases in the number of black roots by 20.04% and yellow roots by 12.58%; the use of the FI system may also reduce humidity of the rice field and enhance gas transport in the soil and light penetration, which led to reduced rice diseases and increased leaf vitality; and (3) increases in tiller and effective spikes by 11.53% and the weight per thousand grains by 1.0 g.

The losses include interference with cultivation of crops, loss of biodiversity, loss of potentially productive lands, loss of grazing areas and livestock production, erosion following fires in heavily invaded areas, choking of navigational and irrigation canals and reduction of available water in water bodies. Weed management takes away nearly one third of total cost of production of field crops. In India, the manual method of weed control is quite popular and effective. Of late, labour has become non-availability and costly, due to intensification, diversification of agriculture and urbanization. The usage of herbicides in India and elsewhere in the world is increasing due to possible benefits to farmers and continuous use of the same group of herbicides over a period of time on a same piece of land leads to ecological imbalance in terms of weed shift and environmental pollution. The complexity of these situations has resulted in a need to develop a wholistic sustainable eco-friendly weed management programme throughout the farming period. Objectives: This study reviews the different approaches used in sustainable weed control options. Conclusion: Sustainable farming has the ability to save the natural resources for the future and develop the farm in the little expense, a transition to sustainable weed control is required for environmental, social and economic reasons and sustainable weed management is socially acceptable, environmentally benign and cost-effective.",https://doi.org/10.17311/sciintl.2015.37.47,

Internet of things (IoT) solutions based on real-time farm sensor data and intelligent decision support systems have led to many smart farming solutions, thus improving water utilization. The objective of this study was to compare and optimize water usage in a 2-acre lemon farm test site in Gadap, Karachi, for a 9-month duration, by deploying an indigenously developed IoT device and an agriculture-based decision support system (DSS). The sensor data are wirelessly collected over the cloud and a mobile application, as well as a web-based information visualization, and a DSS system makes irrigation recommendations. The DSS system is based on weather data (temperature and humidity), real time in situ sensor data from the IoT device deployed in the farm, and crop data (Kc and crop type). These data are supplied to the Penman–Monteith and crop coefficient model to make recommendations for irrigation schedules in the test site. The results show impressive water savings (~50%) combined with increased yield (35%) when compared with water usage and crop yields in a neighboring 2-acre lemon farm where traditional irrigation scheduling was employed and where harsh conditions sometimes resulted in temperatures in excess of 50 °C.",https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/21/12/4175/pdf?version=1624011481,

With the popularity and growth of the Internet of Things (IoT) in recent years, there are even more avenues for technology to make agriculture more efficient and help farmers in every nation. In this paper, we designed a smart IoT-enabled drip irrigation system using ESP32 to automate the irrigation process, and we tested it. The ESP32 communicates with the Blynk app, which is used to collect irrigation data, manually water the plants, switch off the automatic watering function, and plot graphs based on the readings of the sensors. We connected the ESP32 to a soil moisture sensor, temperature sensor, air humidity sensor, and water flow sensor. The ESP32 regularly checks if the soil is dry. If the soil is dry and the soil temperature is appropriate for watering, the ESP32 opens a solenoid valve and waters the plants. The amount of time to run the drip irrigation system is determined based on the flow rate measured by the water flow sensor. The ESP32 reads the humidity sensor values and notifies the user when the humidity is too high or too low. The user can switch off the automatic watering system according to the humidity value.

One major source of data on health and development is the USAID‐funded Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) program. DHS is a major source of population and health data for the poorest countries in the world and provides high‐quality and detailed data on individual health outcomes—particularly outcomes related to maternal and child health. The primary sampling unit in the DHS are villages or village “clusters.” Cluster size can vary but contains a number of households within a geographic area who participated in the survey. Since many of the data included in DHS are personal and potentially sensitive, the DHS maintains confidentiality of the respondents by shifting the spatial coordinates of the cluster in the published data (Burgert et al. 2013). The spatial coordinates for rural locations are displaced by 0–5 km in any direction. Additionally, a small fraction of coordinates, 1 percent, are randomly shifted up to 10 km. For urban locations, the displacement is up to 2 km only. DHS recommends that researchers average any environmental data over a 5–10 km buffer around each DHS rural cluster with the specific community falling somewhere within the disc around each point (Perez‐Heydrich et al. 2016). This approach to maintaining confidentiality while collecting survey information has been adopted by other international organizations as well (e.g., World Bank's Living Standards Measurement Study). Building on the rapid growth of literature around activity space, the geographic theory of close things being more alike (Tobler's First Law), as well as the understanding that people interact disproportionately with the landscape immediately surrounding a settlement, we propose an alternative method for evaluating environmental and contextual variables (Tobler 1970; Miller, 2004). Instead of calculating a 5–10 km buffer around each published point, we propose that the user selects a settlement near the DHS’ published cluster location and measures the environmental conditions around the settlement using a buffer much smaller than 10 km. We assume that the “true” context is a small, precise buffer around the correct settlement. We hypothesize that a small, precise buffer around an incorrect settlement is a better measure of truth than is an overly large buffer around the published point. Settlements can be identified through interpreting remotely sensed imagery. Corresponding features—for example, types of land‐use strategies or adjacency to reservoirs for irrigation—can be more easily identified and evaluated when using a much more precise buffer. While the settlement that is being used to provide this contextual information is likely not the original DHS cluster, it is a neighbor of the cluster and we assume that neighboring settlements are more similar to each other than to the broader environment in which they are situated. We theorize that this approach will introduce less measurement error than the larger 10 km buffer. To test this theory, we select three countries that are topographically diverse and that represent unique regions of the world—Burkina Faso, Kenya, and Tajikistan. As with most of the poorest countries in the world, these countries are heavily dependent on the landscape to produce food and earn money. However, each of these countries is quite distinct from the others in terms of environmental characteristics (rainfall and topography) and cultural characteristics (the types of crops produced as well as the farming strategies used to produce the crops). We select these countries to develop a thorough understanding of how our methodology will function under different settings. We evaluate a remotely‐sensed estimate of cultivated area and vegetation features of the DHS clusters using the 5–10 km buffer approach and our proposed neighboring settlement approach. We compare these to the true values through the use of the actual, confidential, locations of settlements in the DHS sample.",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1111/padr.12222,

This study was undertaken to identify factors in Australian cotton farming systems that influence yield and fibre quality of cotton and how these have changed with time after the wide adoption of Bollgard II® cultivars (containing the proteins Cry1Ac and Cry2Ab, providing easier control of Helicoverpa spp.) in the 2003–04 season. Data from Australian commercial cotton variety trials conducted from 2004 to 2011 were used to link management inputs, yield, and fibre quality. Restricted (residual) maximum likelihood (REML) and regression analyses were used to determine which factors had a significant effect on yield and fibre quality. Results showed that lint yield was significantly influenced by cultivar and growing region, and the interaction between region and the amount of applied nitrogen and phosphorus (kg ha–1), plant stand (plants ha–1), in-crop rainfall (mm) and the number of irrigations, season length (days), and days to defoliation. Generally, the same factors also influenced fibre quality. Regression analysis captured 41, 71, 50, 30, and 36% of the variability in lint yield, fibre length, micronaire, fibre strength, and trash, respectively, for irrigated systems. For dryland systems the variability captured was 97, 87, 77 80, and 78%, respectively. Changes in cotton farming systems from 2004 to 2011 have occurred with applied nitrogen fertiliser increasing under irrigation and decreasing under dryland systems. However, phosphorus fertiliser use has remained steady under irrigated and decreased under dryland systems, and the number of insect sprayings has decreased under both systems. Under irrigated systems, lint yield, fibre length, and trash levels increased while micronaire and fibre strength decreased. Under dryland systems, lint yield decreased while micronaire, fibre length, strength, and trash levels increased. All fibre quality parameters satisfied criteria that would not incur a penalty. The results considering which factors are the most important and which are of lesser importance provide some insight to changes in management in both irrigated and dryland systems and the effect on lint yield and fibre quality and provide some basis for future investment in research and development and extension to the Australian cotton industry.",http://www.publish.csiro.au/cp/pdf/CP13172,

The archaeobotanical remains consist of thousands of cultivated grains dating to the mid-late third millennium BCE. The recovery of cereal chaff and weeds suggest local cultivation at 2000 m.a.s.l., as crops first spread to the mountains of Central Asia. The site’s inhabitants possibly cultivated two types of free-threshing wheats, glume wheats, and hulled and naked barleys. Highly compact caryopses of wheat and barley grains represent distinct morphotypes of cereals adapted to highland environments. While additional macrobotanical evidence is needed to confirm the presence of glume wheats at Chap II, the possible identification of glume wheats at Chap II may represent their most eastern distribution in Central Asia. Based on the presence of weed species, we argue that the past environment of Chap II was characterized by an open mountain landscape, where animal grazing likely took place, which may have been further modified by people irrigating agricultural fields. This research suggests that early farmers in the mountains of Central Asia cultivated compact morphotypes of southwest Asian crops during the initial eastward dispersal of agricultural technologies, which likely played a critical role in shaping montane adaptations and dynamic interaction networks between farming societies across highland and lowland cultivation zones.",https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0229372&type=printable,

As one of the largest potato-producing provinces in Canada, Prince Edward Island (PEI) has recently experienced significant instability in potato production. PEI’s local farmers and stakeholders are extremely concerned about the prospects for the future of potato farming industries in the context of climate change. This study aims to use the Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT) potato model to simulate future potato yields under the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) climate scenarios (including SSP1–1.9, SSP1–2.6, SSP2–4.5, SSP3–7.0, and SSP5–8.5). The study evaluates the combined effects of changing climatic conditions at local scales (i.e., warming temperature and changing precipitation patterns) and increasing carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration in the atmosphere. The results indicate future significant declines in potato yield in PEI under the current farming practices. In particular, under the high-emission scenarios (e.g., SSP3–7.0 and SSP5–8.5), the potato yield in PEI would decline by 48% and 60% in the 2070s and by 63% and 80% by 2090s; even under the low-emission scenarios (i.e., SSP1–1.9 and SSP1–2.6), the potato yield in PEI would still decline by 6–10%.

On-farm ponds can prevent excessive groundwater exploitation – to the benefit of the whole community – but they reduce the cultivated area and require investments by each farmer. Thus, choosing the source of water for irrigation (groundwater vs on-farm pond) is a problem of collective action. An agent-based model is developed to simulate a smallholder farming system; the farmers’ long-/short-view orientation determines the choice of the water source. We identify the most beneficial water source for economic gain and its stability, and how it can change across communities and under future climate scenarios. By using on-farm ponds, long-view-oriented farmers provide collective advantages but have individual advantages only under extreme climates; a tragedy of the commons is always possible.

Food security—having physical and economic access to enough safe, nutritious food—is inextricably linked with environmental conditions. Weather extremes that impede growing conditions can limit or curtail food production, especially in regions where such conditions persist, and floods can cause rates of food-borne cholera to rise. Weather-related famines are now affecting millions of people in Africa, 12.5 million in Ethiopia alone. The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization’s Special Programme for Food Security (SPFS), located online at http://www.fao.org/spfs/, is one effort to help developing countries improve their food security. The SPFS was begun in 1994 and endorsed at the 1996 World Food Summit, where delegates called for a halving of the number of malnourished people in the world by the year 2015. The program aims to improve nations’ food security through rapid increases in food production and productivity, by reducing year-to-year variability in food production, and by improving people’s access to food. The SPFS webpage provides a look at the work done by the program, offering information in Arabic, Chinese, English, French, and Spanish. The program currently provides assistance in 100 countries, most of which are termed “low-income food deficit countries.” The SPFS uses a two-phase approach to introducing new food management methods, described on the Phases and Approaches page. It first provides farmers and others working on the project with the basic essentials—seeds and farming implements—along with training in best practices. Each project has four components, including water control, intensification of crop production systems, diversification of production systems, and analysis and resolution of obstacles. In the second phase, successful approaches are scaled up, and the SPFS works at the national level in member countries to create a nationwide strategy for food security. Once a community agrees to use a new system, it is adapted, with community input, to best meet the community’s needs and take advantage of local resources. For example, a treadle pump developed in Bangladesh is now in use in several other Asian and African countries. This pump, described on the Best Practices page, allows more land to be irrigated with less strenuous labor involved than use of a traditional watering can. The Case Studies page includes a description of how the treadle pump was introduced in Zambia, allowing many farmers to double their growing area and grow new crops, with significant increases in income. Two of the SPFS regions, Asia and Central America, have sections within the main site. Here visitors can find information on the project work going on in specific countries within each region. Each country page includes geographic and economic overviews, information on training sessions, an outline of how the SPFS was implemented in that country, and a list of technologies developed there.

Conservation agriculture (CA) based management practices together with cropping system optimization have demonstrated to produce more with less while restoring, conserving and sustaining natural resources. In north-western India, maize (Zea mays L.) based systems are being advocated as an alternate to rice-based systems to address the issues of resource degradation particularly water table and climate-change-induced variability in rainfall and temperature, etc. However, targeting maize systems without futuristic best-bet crop management practices suited to production systems and ecologies, may lead to other problems. Therefore, we attempted to evaluate the performance of maize in kharif 2014 under long-term CA-based [permanent bed (PB) and zero tillage (ZT)] practices with conventional tillage (CT) as main-plots and four intensified irrigated maize systems [maize-wheat-mungbean (MWMb), maize-chickpea-Sesbania (MCS), maize-mustard-mungbean (MMuMb) and maize-maize-Sesbania (MMS)] in sub-plots under an ongoing trial established in 2008. During seventh year of study, higher maize glucose equivalent yield (MGEY) was recorded in ZT (2 942 kg/ha) and PB (2 774 kg/ha) while, the lowest in CT (2 576 kg/ha). Similarly maize glucose equivalent yield under diversified maize-based rotations was invariably higher in MCS and MWMb systems compared to MMuMb and MMS rotations. The results revealed that the maximum total N, P and K uptake (134.7, 40.9 and 156.6 kg/ha) as well as the protein content (8.7%) in maize grain were recorded in ZT, and minimum in CT. However, among the cropping systems plots the kharif maize planted in MCS plots registered the highest N, P, K uptake in stover and grain and protein (8.96%) content in grain. Maize net returns and BC ratio were significantly higher under ZT and PB planting compared to CT. Net returns and BC ratio under ZT and PB were higher by 18-29% and 26-38%, compared to CT plots, respectively. The maximum gross output energy (210.1×103 MJ/ha), energy efficiency (16.4) and energy intensity (8.50 MJ/`) were recorded under ZT. Tillage and cropping system interactions significantly influenced maize cob and grain yield in 7th year of experimentation and maximum yield was in ZT-MCS. Overall, our long-term results suggest that adoption of conservation agriculture-based tillage under MCS and MWMb systems can enhance crop productivity, profitability, nutrient uptake and energetics of kharif maize in north-western region of India and elsewhere under similar agro- climatic conditions.",https://epubs.icar.org.in/index.php/IJAgS/article/download/58897/24404,

But as the flat topography does not provide sufficient natural drainage, water logging and raising groundwater tables have become serious problems for the agricultural productivity. The combination of the high salinity of the irrigation water and the generous application of fertilizers leads to a widespread soil salinization. Excessive leaching is supposed to reduce the top soil salinity, but as the drainage system is only covering a small portion of the irrigated areas and is in need of maintenance, this process only contributes to the ongoing salinization and the reduction of soil fertility and crop yields. The data presented here for the years 2000 to 2013 indicate that the groundwater table is rising throughout the region while the groundwater salinity is decreasing.

However, traditional irrigation methods can be time-consuming and labor-intensive, and often result in the over or under-watering of crops, which can negatively impact crop yields. To overcome these challenges, smart irrigation systems have been developed to assist farmers in managing their crops and increasing their yield. This research article presents an IoT-based smart irrigation system that uses four sensors - moisture content, temperature, humidity, and ultrasonic - to collect data from the irrigation area and transmit it to a central control system. The central control system uses the data to automatically turn the irrigation pump on and off, based on the moisture level of the soil. The system also includes a mobile application that allows farmers to monitor the system remotely and control the motor pump from their smartphones. The proposed system has several advantages, including reducing the hard work of farmers, providing essential strength to crops, and ensuring that plants receive the adequate amount of water at the required time. Additionally, the system's remote monitoring capabilities allow farmers to monitor the atmospheric temperature, humidity, and moisture content from anywhere at any time, and make adjustments as necessary. Overall, the findings of this research will help farmers to control their irrigation systems remotely, reduce labor costs, and increase crop yields.

Further, the progressive change in growth and development is critical in crop monitoring and taking suitable decisions to maintain health status. In order to accomplish the task, drones are highly useful for on site detection of problems so as to undertake corrective measures instantly. Although it is expensive to build algorithms and establish relationships between ground truth and spectral signatures, it is a user-friendly technique once the basics studies are done. As labor availability and technical manpower are extremely limited, particularly in India, drones are gaining popularity in the context of smart farming. Insect pests are known to cause catastrophe and drastic reduction in food grain production across the globe. The losses that have been predicted by FAO is over 37% due to pests and diseases. Recently, crops cultivated in India have been threatened by invasive pests like fall army worm (Spodoptera frugiperda) in corn and Rugose spiraling whitefly in coconut (Aleurodicus rugiperculatous Martin); these pests caused extensive damage during the years 2018 and 2019. The plant protection measures are to be taken on a community basis so as to ensure effective management of pests. In India, more than 80% of farmlands are in the category of small and marginal (<1 ha), so it is very difficult to manage the invasive pests. If one field is sprayed, the pests simply shift their feeding to the neighboring fields. To address this, drones become essential. Drones are unmanned aerial vehicles exploited in a wide array of disciplines such as defense, monitoring systems, and disaster management but are only beginning to be utilized in agricultural sciences. There are three major types of drones, namely fixed wing, multi-rotor, and hybrid type, and the usage depends on specific applications. The other types depend on degree of automation, size, weight, and power source. The set operational parameters such as flight speed, height, and endurance need to be optimized to use drones appropriately in agriculture and allied sectors. In addition, parameters related to drone-based spraying such as droplet size, spread, density, uniformity, deposition, and penetrability should also be factored in when implementing drone-based mitigation strategies. Despite the fact that drone technology is highly relevant and appropriate for pest management, the adoption of the technology is restricted. Regulatory guidelines have been set across the globe to perform site-specific farm management with higher precision at a very high resolution. Overall, drones can be employed in almost all agricultural field operations and are considered excellent tools for rapid, reliable, and non-destructive detection of field problems.

Here, we define the optimal flowering period (OFP) as the calendar time in which long-term risk of frost, water and heat stress are collectively minimised. Using the internationally-renowned farming systems model Agricultural Systems Production Systems sIMulator, we characterised combined effects of climate change and extreme climatic events on the OFPs of barley, durum wheat, canola, chickpeas, fababean and maize from 1910 to 2021. We generate response surfaces for irrigated and dryland conditions using a range of representative sowing times for early and late maturity genotypes. Global warming truncated crop lifecycles, shifting forward flowering of winter crops by 2–43 d in dryland environments, and by −6–19 d in environments with irrigation. Alleviation of water stress by irrigation delayed OFPs by 3–25 d or 11–30 d for early and late maturity winter crops, respectively, raising average yields of irrigated crops by 44%. Even so, irrigation was unable to completely negate the long-term yield penalty caused by the climate crisis; peak yields respectively declined by 24% and 13% for rainfed and irrigated crops over the 111 years simulation duration.

Groundwater irrigation is generally practiced to supplement surface water supplies in Pakistan. Nevertheless, uninterrupted and extensive use of groundwater irrigation has raised several concerns about its sustainability and resultant environmental implications. Due to the scarcity of groundwater and heterogeneity in farmers’ resources, informal groundwater markets have emerged in Pakistan, where farmers trade water using a contractual system. Yet, the effects of these markets on agricultural productivity and equity remain largely unknown. This paper aims to analyze the impact of participation in the groundwater market on farmland utilization, cropping patterns, water access, and income. We analyze these impacts using primary data collected from 360 farmers in three different zones of the country’s largest province. The farmers were categorized as buyers, sellers, and self-users of water. Results indicate that participation in water markets increased agricultural land utilization, evinced by a higher cropping intensity among participants. A horizontal and vertical equity analysis of water markets shows that although large farmers have better access to groundwater irrigation, water market participation improves equity to water access. Based on income inequality measures such as the Gini coefficient and the Lorenz curve, water market participation also improves farmer incomes regardless of farm size. Propensity score matching revealed that wheat yield and income among water-market participants went up by approximately 150 kg and PKR 4503 per acre compared with non-participants. Groundwater market participants’ higher crop productivity and income level suggest that water markets need a thorough revisit in terms of policy focus and institutional support to ensure sustainable rural development.",https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4441/14/12/1832/pdf?version=1654588426,

One of these challenges is the reduction in per capita land available for soil-based farming, which leads to other agricultural and environmental issues. Under these critical circumstances, it became necessary to develop advanced technologies and techniques to withstand the current situation. Although several works were carried out on cultivation of plants in soil and in vitro, few of these are concentrated on soilless cultures. Soilless agriculture is a new promising method for improving cultivation of different cash crops. Besides reservation and restoration of cultivation lands, soilless farming, especially close-loop system, has various advantages: it utilizes recycled fixed amount of water, saves 85–90% of irrigation water, can be implemented in areas unfavourable for ordinary farming, almost zero environmental pollution, better yield than conventional cultivation. In the present study, various techniques of soilless farming are elaborated and a basic design of eco-friendly soilless farming unit is proposed.",https://doi.org/10.18520/cs/v116/i5/728-732,

It was found that in the short run, only rainfall tested significantly positive to crop output among the climate change factors but there is evidence of significant effects of all climate change factors on crop output in the long-run. For example, temperature, carbon dioxide emission, carbon emission and rainfall were tested significantly to crop output. Furthermore, non-climate change factors like economically active population, gross capital formation, and land area equipped for irrigation were significantly positive to crop output. To forestall the effects of climate change on crop output, the study recommends that policy makers should formulate policies that will aid farmers towards adaptation practices in farming that can mitigate the effects of climate change.

Because some microorganisms exert beneficial traits that improve plant growth and health, understanding how to modulate microbial communities will help in developing smart farming and favor plant growth-promoting (PGP) microorganisms. With tremendous cost cuts in NGS technologies, metagenomic approaches are now affordable and have been widely used to investigate crop-associated microbiomes.

Determination of spatial and temporal actual evapotranspiration (ETa), in this regard, is of vital importance as there is significant water loss from drainage basins. This research paper uses the Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL), as well as the water balance, to estimate the spatial and temporal ETa in the Al-Khazir Gomal Basin, Northern Iraq. To compensate for the shortage in rainfall, and to irrigate summer crops, farmers in this basin have been depending, to a large extent, on groundwater extracted from the underlying unconfined aquifer, which is considered the major source for both domestic and agricultural uses in this basin. Rainfed farming of wheat and barley is one of the most important activities in the basin in the winter season, while in the summer season, agricultural activity is limited to small rice fields and narrow strips of vegetable cultivation along the Al-Khazir River. The Landsat Thematic Mapper images (TM5) acquired on 21 November 2006, 9 March 2007, 5 May 2007, 21 July 2007, and 23 September 2007 were used, along with a digital elevation model (DEM) and ground-based meteorological data, measured within the area of interest. Estimation of seasonal ETa from periods between satellite overpasses was computed using the evaporative fraction (Ʌ). The water balance approach was utilized, using meteorological data and river hydrograph analysis, to estimate the ETa as the only missing input in the predefined water balance equation. The results of the two applied methods were comparable. SEBAL results were compared with the land use land cover (LULC) map. The river showed the highest ETa, as evaporation from the free-water surface. Rice fields, irrigated in the summer season, have a high ETa in the images, as these fields are immersed in water during June, July and August. Vegetated corridors along the riverside showed different ETa values, as they contain a mosaic of different crops in different stages of growth. Conglomerate and bare sandstone outcrops showed no ETa, with some exceptions in the mountainous area, where these outcrops are affected by perennial springs. The results indicate the applicability of SEBAL in the study area, and they could be used in further studies to estimate the water budget of the basin.",https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3263/5/2/141/pdf?version=1429515578,

In addition, soil water content, biometric parameters, and physiological parameters were measured. The DATT index, based on near-infrared and red-edge wavelengths, performed better than other indices in explaining the variation in chlorophyll content, whereas the double difference index (DD) showed the greatest correlation with the leaf–gas exchange. The modified normalized difference vegetation index (NNDVI) and the ratio of water band index to normalized difference vegetation index (WBI/NDVI) showed the highest capacity to distinguish the interaction of irrigation x nitrogen, while the best discriminating capability of these indices was under a low nitrogen level.

Although rice was introduced to the country very recently, it has proven to be a crop that can assure food security in Ethiopia. It is reported that the potential rice production area in Ethiopia is estimated to be about thirty million hectares. Since 2006, Ethiopian rice production trends show increases in both area and productivity. Considering the importance and potential of the crop, it has been recognized by the Government as “the new millennium crop of Ethiopia” to attain food security. Rice has become a commodity of strategic significance across many parts of Ethiopia for domestic consumption as well as export market for economic development. Due to the introduction of upland and irrigated rice varieties in the country, rice farming has increased from time to time. There has been twelve upland/lowland NERICAs and Sativa-type, and three irrigated rice varieties released in Ethiopia from 1999 up to 2007.

Results were compared to those after application of inorganic fertilizer. At the end of the study, in both soil types the organic treatments had increased the organic matter and nitrogen content compared with the inorganic treatment. Total organic carbon (TOC) values in the clay were higher than in the loam. This could be related to a lower mineralization rate of soil organic matter under dry land management and/or with a protection effect, by the clay on the organic fraction. However, absolute ratios of some enzymatic activities (dehydrogenase, protease and alkaline phosphatase) by microbial biomass carbon in the clay were lower than in the loam indicating a lower rate of enzyme production by microbial biomass in the clay. In the clay soil there was a great increase in TOC, total N, microbial biomass and enzymatic activity, in all treatments, in the last crop cycle. This was mainly related to a previous legume crop.

Increases in precipitation encourage farmers to shift from irrigated to rainfed crops. As temperatures increase, farm incomes from crop-only farms or livestock-only farms fall whereas incomes from mixed farms increase. With precipitation increases, farm incomes from irrigated farms fall whereas incomes from rainfed farms increase.

Like the fields they plant or the livestock they raise, no season, and no farm operation, is the same. Implementation of emerging technology is one thing setting several farming operations apart from their competition, whether crop farms, dairy farms or livestock farms. Much like other commercial industries, agriculture has been on the receiving end of new and evolving technologies that make life on the farm easier while increasing efficiency and decreasing costs. New farm technology ranges from the simplest smart phone app that turns an iPod into a mobile milk-monitoring station or allows farmers to record herd information from the field to the hundreds of thousands of dollars that may be spent on precision planting equipment. The demand and need for new technologies have largely been increased in the world. One of the most progressed technologies is about genetics, genomics and genetic modification in agriculture [1-4]. Large scale planting systems are increasingly being used to boost production. These mechanical devices work better when the shape of the seed is more uniform; the seeds “flow better” in a mechanical sense. Pelleting caters to this type of requirement, by creating round pellets of a standardized size. Besides this plantability issue, there are multiple other reasons to use a pellet: use of phototoxic products, weight and/or volume increase, addition of biological control agents, and growth promoting agents. Pesticides and fungicides have been around for a long time. By incorporating these products in a thin film around the seeds their overall performance can be greatly improved and the amounts of these products needed for efficacy greatly reduced. This has a direct impact on the cost effectiveness, the protection and the final yield on the field. The advantage to the environment is huge compared to traditional field application; the chemical load of these chemicals on the environment has been reduced to almost nothing.

There is a wide range of Vegetable seeds, different moisture content. Safety seed storage has important significance of vegetable seed germination and planting quality. Only the security storage, seeds can achieve the effect of high income after planting. At present the general method of seed storage is put the seed with sacks or sacks under normal temperature stacking storage after natural drying. Seed storage affect by temperature and humidity which will change seeds’ water content, made seed vigor decrease rapidly. At present the most effective way of seeds storage is put seeds in low temperature and humidity environment, which can effectively delay seeds service life. Although many studies have been done on irrigation and water resources management [5-30], but all of them have been considered classical conditions for crops. However, these conditions that include grows coefficients (Kc) related to the evapotranspiration, water and salinity stress etc., are changed when farmers are used improved seeds. In improved seeds, required water and other water management parameters are different from initial conditions (unimproved seeds). According to that a slender difference in water requirement estimation is caused damage in agricultural productions or water losses, need to update of irrigation and water resources information according to the progresses of agricultural knowledge is very important.",https://doi.org/10.4172/2168-9881.s10-e001,

The main objective of the study was to investigate the profitability of smallholder sugarcane farmers’ associations under KDDP and to explain the determinants of sugarcane profitability. The study used data from 2004/05 to 2010/11 production seasons for 15 smallholder sugarcane farmers’ associations under KDDP. A structured questionnaire was used to solicit production and financial data. Secondary data were obtained from accounting records of the farmers. The associations were purposively selected because of their experience in sugarcane production. Descriptive statistics such as mean, standard deviation, minimum and maximum values were used in data analysis. The cost and returns analysis was used to assess the profitability, whilst multiple linear regression analysis was used in identifying the determinants of profitability.The associations were found to be profitable with a mean profit per hectare of E5080.00.The further results indicated that variables such as farm size, farming experience, sucrose price, labour cost per hectare and fertilizer cost per hectare significantly (p<0.01) influence the profitability of smallholder sugarcane farmers’ associations in the study area. The adjusted R2 was 0.623, suggesting that about 62.3% in the variation in profit per hectare is explained by the explanatory variables. It is, therefore recommended that good crop husbandry practices like timely weeding, fertilization, and irrigation should be adopted to produce a good crop which will enhance profitability. There is need for the promotion of collective action as an institutional means to improve bargaining power of farmers, especially when procuring inputs. Collective action will enable smallholder sugarcane farmers to buy in bulk and be entitled to discounts and that can enhance sustainability of profitability of the farmers.",https://ccsenet.org/journal/index.php/sar/article/download/18975/13213,

This article presents a monitoring system applied to an aeroponic greenhouse based on an IoT architecture that provides user information on the status of the climatic variables and the appearance of the crop in addition to managing the irrigation timing and the frequency of visual inspection using an application developed for Android mobile devices called Aeroponics Monitor. The proposed IoT architecture consists of four layers: a device layer, fog layer, cloud layer and application layer. Once the information about the monitored variables is obtained by the sensors of the device layer, the fog layer processes it and transfers it to the Thingspeak and Firebase servers. In the cloud layer, Thingspeak analyzes the information from the variables monitored in the greenhouse through its IoT analytic tools to generate historical data and visualizations of their behavior, as well as an analysis of the system’s operating status. Firebase, on the other hand, is used as a database to store the results of the processing of the images taken in the fog layer for the supervision of the leaves and roots. The results of the analysis of the information of the monitored variables and of the processing of the images are presented in the developed app, with the objective of visualizing the state of the crop and to know the function of the monitoring system in the event of a possible lack of electricity or a service line failure in the fog layer and to avoid the loss of information. With the information about the temperature of the plant leaf and the relative humidity inside the greenhouse, the vapor pressure deficit (VPD) in the cloud layer is calculated; the VPD values are available on the Thingspeak server and in the developed app. Additionally, an analysis of the VPD is presented that demonstrates a water deficiency from the transplanting of the seedling to the cultivation chamber.

Water samples were collected in summer and winter from selected sites across the study area and were analysed for salinity as well as for concentrations of major and minor ions. Each site consists of one borehole and one pond. Isotope analysis was done for the summer samples so as to assess effects of evaporation on water quality and salin ity. Descriptive statistics were used to compare the variation in range of concentration of specific ions with the recom mended ranges set by the South African Department of Water Affairs and Forestry (DWAF) and the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO). Geographical information system (GIS) analysis was used to describe the spatial distribution of salinity across the study area, and hydro-geochemical analysis was used to assess the possibility of seawater intrusion into the aquifer system and to characterise groundwater in the study area. The results of the research showed that the concentrations of chloride, nitrate, potassium and sodium exceeded the target maximum limit according to DWAF and FAO guidelines. Groundwater and pond water were also observed to be brackish in most parts of the research area in terms of total dissolved salts content, and fresh water was only found in the middle section of the research area. It is concluded that the accumulation of salts in groundwater and soil in the study area is mainly due to the agricultural activities and partially due to the natural movement of water through the geological formation of the Cape Flats region. These findings permit the formulation of a conceptual model of the occurrence of the salinization process, which implies that the groundwater and pond water in the study area are generally suitable for irrigation purposes, but need to be used with caution as the vegetables grown are classified as sensitive and moderately sensitive to salt according to DWAF guidelines for irrigation water quality (1996).

Nowadays, use of wastewater in agriculture for production of vegetables is controversial due to its benefits and negative health impacts. Thus, the objective of this paper is to review the benefits and potential health risks in wastewater-irrigated vegetables. Urban vegetable farming by using wastewater can contribute a wide range of benefits to improved livelihoods. In Ethiopia, the wastewater is the only means of survival. The average income from wastewater farming has a vital role, and majority of the wastewater farm households report that they benefit from the wastewater. Despite the great importance of irrigating vegetable crops with wastewater, as a food source for the urban community and as income generation, it is subject to numerous constraints and is causing high health risks like cholera, typhoid, etc., among consumers of wastewater-irrigated produce. Depending on reviewed documents, about potential contamination and health effects of wastewater-irrigated vegetables in urban areas in Ethiopia, irrigation water requirement has been growing in rapidly growing urban centers, and water has become a fragile and scarce resource in a competing environment. Management of water resources and proper utilization of vegetables grown in wastewater irrigation has become one option in developing countries for farmers as well as consumers in urban areas in order to ensure food and nutritional security. Wastewater should be managed properly by the application of different wastewater treatment techniques and proper handling of vegetables to reduce contamination.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/23311932.2020.1772629?needAccess=true,

The aim of the research was to understand the hydrogeological conditions of these high-discharge springs and the recharge–discharge relations in the Infranz catchment. The Infranz catchment is covered by highly pervious and young quaternary volcanic rocks, consisting of blocky, fractured, and strongly vesicular scoriaceous basalt. At the surface, these rocks crop out as lineaments forming ridges, delimiting closed depressions in which water accumulates during the rainy season without causing surface runoff. Geology and geomorphology thus combine to produce very favorable conditions for groundwater recharge. Three groundwater recharge methods were applied to estimate groundwater recharge and the results were compared. Groundwater recharge was calculated to be 30% to 51% of rainfall. Rapid replenishment raises the groundwater level during the rainfall period, followed by a rapid decline during the dry season. Shallow local flow paths discharge at seasonal springs and streams, while more regional and deeper flow systems downstream sustain the high-discharge springs and perennial Infranz River.

After the implementation of PRISM there has been considerable increase in vegetable farming area in both districts. Numbers of vegetable crops grown were increased with respect to yield and net return from both the winter and summer vegetables. With the opening of organized markets and large scale increase in income, farmers were attracted towards vegetable cultivation that provided wide range of vegetables for consumers as well. Earlier farmers cultivated vegetables only when there would be fallow land after the harvest of main season cereal crops while after the adoption of new technology farmers grew vegetables all the yearround. Among the popular vegetables during summer was cucumber in the hills and okra in the Terai covering more land than other vegetables crops in the study area. These cropshelp farmers achieve net return of NRs.25240.6 and from NRs. 20425.4 per Ropani in Kaski and Kapilbastu, respectively. Land area under vegetables crops were increased by 6 times in Kaski and 12 times in Kapilbastu. This increase in net return has been found as a result of creating better marketing system developed by the activity of the PRISM. Similarly, involvement of household in summer season vegetable was not enough and farmers hired labor for commercial vegetables cultivation.

This study looked at communities’ perception of climate change impacts, barriers and effective adaptation strategies towards climate change in selected districts of western Oromia. This study examines smallholder farmers’ perceptions of climate variability, climate change and its impacts on crop production, and adaptation strategies adopted over the past three 30 years. Survey data were collected from 204 respondents using both qualitative and quantitative approaches through purposive sampling techniques. Descriptive statistics such as percentage and frequency were used for data analysis. The results of the study showed that the respondents were perceived, the occurrence of climate change in terms of increase in temperatures, decrease in rainfall and change in timing of rain, change in the onset of rains, erratic rainfall pattern. The study also indicated that due to climate change induced factors the agricultural productivity was reduced from time to time. The results show that about 80%) of farmers who participated had observed recent changes in climate. Perceptions of local communities on climate change and variability are consistent with the analyzed historical climate data. The analyzed climate data show fluctuations in onset date, cessation date and length of growing season (LGS) and change in climate. Farmers perceived weather related problems such as low rain, drought, flood, heat, cold, strong wind that led increased farming problems such as soil erosion, loss of soil fertility; reduction in crop yields and high rate of disease occurrence. The impacts of climate change on crop production were revealed by changes in start of farming season; including: rainfall coming early or late, decrease in rainfall, increase in temperature and increase in farming problems, in particular, increase in soil erosion, loss of soil fertility and reduction in crop yields. The results showed that farmers perceived climate change in terms of changes in rainfall and temperature, increase in drought condition, crop pests and diseases. Those changes had significant impact on farmers’ households whose income depends on rain fed farming. The findings revealed that the impacts of climate in rural areas include reduced in crop yield (49%); increase in pest and disease (34%) and soil erosion (98%). Respondents perceived the main cause of climate change was human action through; intensified agriculture, deforestation, increased use of fossil fuel and use of chemical fertilizer on farms. Therefore, to adapt to the changing in climate, farming community practiced some adaptation measure. The adaptation measures identified were soil and water conservation, crop rotation, change crop varieties, change planting dates, late planting, diversification of crop types and varieties, drought resistant varieties, building water harvesting schemes and use of irrigation. Widely used adaptation measures are soil and water conservation, crop rotation, changing planting dates and change crop varieties in the study area. Besides, the finding identified some serious barriers of adaptation measure to climate change including lack of information, shortage of labor, lack of capital, black of access to water and poor potential for irrigation. Therefore, there is a need to focus community dimensions such as perceptions of smallholder farmers.

Although the estimation of evapotranspiration has achieved great progress through the combination of different remote sensing data and the FAO-56 crop coefficient (Kc) method, lack of the accurate crop water stress coefficient (Ks) at different space–time scales still hinder its operational application to farmer practices. This work aims to explore the potential of multispectral images taken from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for estimating the temporal and spatial variability of Ks under the water stress condition and mapping the variability of field maize ET combined with the FAO-56 Kc model. To search for an optimal estimation method, the performance of several models was compared including models based on Ks either derived from the crop water stress index (CWSI) or calculated by the canopy temperature ratio (Tc ratio), and combined with the basal crop coefficient (Kcb) based on the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). Compared with the Ks derived from the Tc ratio, the CWSI-based Ks responded well to water stress and had strong applicability and convenience. The results of the comparison show that ET derived from the Ks-CWSI had a higher correlation with the modified FAO-56 method, with an R2 = 0.81, root mean square error (RMSE) = 0.95 mm/d, and d = 0.94. In contrast, ET derived from the Ks-Tc ratio had a relatively lower correlation with an R2 = 0.68 and RMSE = 1.25 mm/d. To obtain the evapotranspiration status of the whole maize field and formulate reasonable irrigation schedules, the CWSI obtained by a handheld infrared thermometer was inverted by the renormalized difference vegetation index (RDVI) and the transformed chlorophyll absorption in reflectance index (TCARI). Then, the whole map of Ks can be derived from the VIs by the relationship between CWSI and Ks and can be taken as the basic input for ET estimation at the field scale. The final ET results based on multispectral UAV interpolation measurements can well reflect the crop ET status under different irrigation levels, and greatly help to improve irrigation scheduling through more precise management of deficit irrigation.",https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/11/21/2519/pdf?version=1573204980,

However, to guide policymaking for reducing N2O emissions from agricultural soils, it is necessary to better understand the overall performance and variability of mitigation practices and identify those requiring further investigation. We performed a systematic review and a second-order meta-analysis to assess the abatement efficiency of N2O mitigation practices from agricultural soils. We used 27 meta-analyses including 41 effect sizes based on 1119 primary studies. Technology-driven solutions (e.g. enhanced-efficiency fertilizers, drip irrigation, and biochar) and optimization of fertilizer rate have considerable mitigation potential. Agroecological mitigation practices (e.g. organic fertilizer and reduced tillage), while potentially contributing to soil quality and carbon storage, may enhance N2O emissions and only lead to reductions under certain pedoclimatic and farming conditions. Other mitigation practices (e.g. lime amendment or crop residue removal) led to marginal N2O decreases. Despite the variable mitigation potential, evidencing the context-dependency of N2O reductions and tradeoffs, several mitigation practices may maintain or increase crop production, representing relevant alternatives for policymaking to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and safeguard food security.",https://publikationen.bibliothek.kit.edu/1000152513/149631023,

The goal of smart agriculture is to reduce the amount of money spent on agricultural inputs while keeping the quality of the final product constant. The Internet of Things (IoT) has made smart agriculture possible through data collection and storage techniques. For example, modern irrigation systems use effective sensor networks to collect field data for the best plant irrigation. Smart agriculture will become more susceptible to cyber-attacks as its reliance on the IoT ecosystem grows, because IoT networks have a large number of nodes but limited resources, which makes security a difficult issue. Hence, it is crucial to have an intrusion detection system (IDS) that can address such challenges. In this manuscript, an IoT-based privacy-preserving anomaly detection model for smart agriculture has been proposed. The motivation behind this work is twofold. Firstly, ensuring data privacy in IoT-based agriculture is of the utmost importance due to the large volumes of sensitive information collected by IoT devices, including on environmental conditions, crop health, and resource utilization data. Secondly, the timely detection of anomalies in smart agriculture systems is critical to enable proactive interventions, such as preventing crop damage, optimizing resource allocation, and ensuring sustainable farming practices. In this paper, we propose a privacy-encoding-based enhanced deep learning framework for the difficulty of data encryption and intrusion detection. In terms of data encoding, a novel method of a sparse capsule-auto encoder (SCAE) is proposed along with feature selection, feature mapping, and feature normalization. An SCAE is used to convert information into a new encrypted format in order to prevent deduction attacks. An attention-based gated recurrent unit neural network model is proposed to detect the intrusion. An AGRU is an advanced version of a GRU which is enhanced by an attention mechanism. In the results section, the proposed model is compared with existing deep learning models using two public datasets. Parameters such as recall, precision, accuracy, and F1-score are considered. The proposed model has accuracy, recall, precision, and F1-score of 99.9%, 99.7%, 99.9%, and 99.8%, respectively. The proposed method is compared using a variety of machine learning techniques such as the deep neural network (DNN), convolutional neural network (CNN), recurrent neural network (RNN), and long short-term memory (LSTM).",https://www.mdpi.com/2079-8954/11/6/304/pdf?version=1686722871,

Potato has emerged as an attractive cash crop due to its income-generating potential and is one of the main sources of income for the majority of the resource-poor smallholder farmers. Thus increasing production and improving marketing efficiency has the potential for raising incomes of the farming households. Using a multi-stage sampling technique, data was collected from a sample of 90 potato producers in Middle Guinea. Results of the Cobb Douglas production function showed that potato area, improved seed use and fertilizer, positively influenced the potato output, while production losses are negatively associated with the potato output.

The combined analysis of variance showed that the effect of water stress on all the traits related to yield, quality traits and all the traits related to yield components except number of leaves, was significant (P < 0.01). The interaction between year and water stress showed that the treatment of WS 0 in all three experimental years significantly (P < 0.05) affected the fresh and dry leaf yield, plant height and sugar and nicotine percentage. The comparison of means of three years (average of three years) also revealed that the treatment of WS 0 significantly (P < 0.05) affected all of the traits which were related to tobacco quantity and quality except for the number of leaves.

Improving food security in Africa will require a good understanding of farming systems yields as well as reducing yield gaps (i.e., the difference between potential yield and actual farmer yield). To this end, crop yield gap practices in African countries need to be understood to fill this gap while decreasing the environmental impacts of agricultural systems. For instance, the variability of yields has been demonstrated to be strongly controlled by soil fertilizer use, irrigation management, soil attribute, and the climate. Consequently, the quantitative assessment and mapping information of soil attributes such as nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), soil organic carbon (SOC), moisture content (MC), and soil texture (i.e., clay, sand and silt contents) on the ground are essential to potentially reducing the yield gap. However, to assess, measure, and monitor these soil yield-related parameters in the field, there is a need for rapid, accurate, and inexpensive methods. Recent advances in remote sensing technologies and high computational performances offer a unique opportunity to implement cost-effective spatiotemporal methods for estimating crop yield with important levels of scalability. However, researchers and scientists in Africa are not taking advantage of the opportunity of increasingly available geospatial remote sensing technologies and data for yield studies. The objectives of this report are to (i) conduct a review of scientific literature on the current status of African yield gap analysis research and their variation in regard to soil properties management by using remote sensing techniques; (ii) review and describe optimal yield practices in Africa; and (iii) identify gaps and limitations to higher yields in African smallholder farms and propose possible improvements. Our literature reviewed 80 publications and covered a period of 22 years (1998-2020) over many selected African countries with a potential yield improvement. Our results found that (i) the number of agriculture yield-focused remote sensing studies has gradually increased, with the largest proportion of studies published during the last 15 years; (ii) most studies were conducted exclusively using multispectral Landsat and Sentinel sensors; and (iii) over the past decade, hyperspectral imagery has contributed to a better understanding of yield gap analysis compared to multispectral imagery; (iv) soil nutrients (i.e., NPK) are not the main factor influencing the studied crop productivity in Africa, whereas clay, SOC, and soil pH were the most examined soil properties in prior papers.",https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/13/22/4602/pdf?version=1637225716,

However, good quality water reserves are not sufficient to meet the demands of farming communities. Consequently, our objective was to evaluate the productivity and profitability of maize under different simulated rainfall scenarios, with and without supplemental irrigation (SI) with brackish water. The field experiments were carried out during the cropping seasons of 2018 and 2019 on Ultisol. The experiment followed a randomized block design in the split-plot scheme with four replicates. The plots were formed by simulating the water supply in the soil corresponding to four water scenarios (rainy, normal, drought and severe drought), and the sub-plots with or without SI with brackish water (Electrical conductivity of 4.5 dS m –1 ). Mean yields of green maize ears were 13,083, 11,532, 10,358 and 9,609 kg ha –1 for rainy, normal, drought and severe drought scenarios, as supplemented with brackish water. For the same treatments without SI the values were 11,394, 7,896, 3,913 and 1,374 kg ha –1 , respectively. Data on farmer’s income showed that under normal, drought and severe drought supplementation with brackish water becomes economically advantageous from 0.9, 1.0 and 2.4 ha, respectively, while maize cultivation without SI is not advantageous under the last two scenarios. For severe drought conditions, however, SI using brackish water reduced commercial yield by 27 % with negative effects on the farmers’ profitability.

An unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) with an RGB camera captured sequential images of rice fields to estimate rice PH compared with PH measured on site for estimating rice growth stages. The test results, with two crop harvests in 2019, revealed that with adequate image calibration, the correlation coefficient between UAV-PH and field-PH was higher than 0.98, indicating that UAV images can accurately determine rice PH in the field and rice growth phase.

Therefore, an experiment was designed to compare two improved management practices, zero tillage (ZT) and ZTR, to conventional tillage (CT), across three pearl millet-based cropping systems: pearl millet–chickpea (PM–CP), PM–CP–mungbean (MB), and PM–CP–forage pearl millet in a two-year experiment.

Results showed a significant increase in pearl millet yield attributes, grain and stover productivity, nutrient uptake, and micronutrient biofortification in the PM–CP–MB cropping system under ZTR relative to other treatment combinations. On-farm evaluation at different locations also showed that the intensification of PM–CP system using summer crops enhanced pearl millet productivity across diverse tillage systems.

Furthermore, survey results indicate that farmers in this area are currently implementing techniques to adapt to changes in climate based on the type of crop grown. Agriculture in Lagos, Nigeria, is largely rain-fed and climate change negatively impacts crop productivity by decreasing crop yield and soil fertility, limiting the availability of soil water, increasing soil erosion, and contributing to the spread of pests. A decline in crop production due to climate change may be further exasperated by a lack of access to farming technology that reduces over-reliance on the rain-fed farming system and subsistence agriculture.

Both cumulative and daily N2O emissions were mainly lower in ORG+ than in INT and ORG. All the cropping systems acted as a sink of CH4, with no significant differences among treatments. The ORG and ORG+ systems accounted for higher cumulative and daily CO2 emissions than INT, maybe due to the stimulating effect on soil respiration of organic material (fertilizers/plant biomass) supplied in ORG and ORG+.

Moreover, climatic data were used to calculate climatic trends between 1980 and 2018. The Mann–Kendall trend test was performed and the Sen’s slope calculated to analyze the inter-annual climatic trends over time. The survey noted that, for the basin, there was an increase in temperature, climate-induced diseases of crops, an increase in the frequency of pests as well as drought and floods and a decrease in rainfall, all which are strong indicators of climate change. It was perceived that these indicators had adverse impacts on crop production (89.4%), human health (82.5%), livestock (68.7%) and vegetation (52.1%). The observed climatic trends for all the physiographic regions included an increasing temperature trend and a decreasing rainfall trend.

Temperature rise and variability in rainfall patterns have had serious consequences on crop and livestock production. Climate-Smart Agriculture (CSA) is one of the solutions that simultaneously address the issues of food security, climate change and agricultural productivity. The objective of this study was to examine trends and variability of temperature and rainfall, identify local CSA practices and their implications to food security. The study was conducted using mixed methods approaches, in which 368 randomly selected households were surveyed, 10 key informants were interviewed, and 6 focus group discussions participants were held. The analysis was based on survey data and a binary logistic regression model was used. Findings revealed that highly adopted CSA practices were conservation agriculture, integrated soil fertility management, small scale irrigation, and improved livestock management. Factors determining CSA practices were also explored such as household size, farming system, off-farm income, access to irrigated farm, distance to market, farm size, and access to agricultural credit. It was evident that CSA practices had a great potential to solve challenges and highest implication to food security. The maximum and minimum annual temperature of the study area has increased by 0.98 and 0.46oC while the trend of average annual temperature has increased by about 0.72oC. Annual rainfall has increased significantly by 153.73 mm, in small rainy season (Belg) has decreased by 30.78 mm, and in main rainy season (Kiremt) has increased significantly by 120.96 mm in the past three decades. The study also concludes that a large proportion of respondents were aware of most of the practices, but adoption of CSA practices examined was very low. Therefore, as a recommendation, sensitization of farmers on reality of climate change and the need to adopt CSA practices towards reduction of adverse effect of climate change should continue. Policy and support program should focus on dissemination of CSA practices to a larger proportion of smallholder farmers.

In this study, grain yield, water and N use efficiencies under different cropping systems including two harvests in 1 year (winter wheat–summer maize) based on farmer (2H1Y)FP and optimized practices (2H1Y)OPT, three harvests in 2 years (winter wheat–summer maize–spring maize, 3H2Y), and one harvest in 1 year (spring maize, 1H1Y) were evaluated using the water-heat-carbon-nitrogen simulator (WHCNS) model. The 2H1YFP system was maintained with 100% irrigation and fertilizer, while crop water requirement and N demand for other cropping systems were optimized and managed by soil testing. In addition, a scenario analysis was also performed under the interaction of linearly increasing and decreasing N rates, and irrigation levels. Results showed that the model performed well with simulated soil water content, soil N concentration, leaf area index, dry matter, and grain yield. Statistically acceptable ranges of root mean square error, Nash–Sutcliffe model efficiency, index of agreement values close to 1, and strong correlation coefficients existed between simulated and observed values. We concluded that replacing the prevalent 2H1YFP with 1H1Y would be ecofriendly at the cost of some grain yield decline. This cropping system had the highest average water use (2.1 kg m−3) and N use efficiencies (4.8 kg kg–1) on reduced water (56.64%) and N (81.36%) inputs than 2H1YFP. Whereas 3H2Y showed insignificant results in terms of grain yield, and 2H1YFP was unsustainable. The 2H1YFP system consumed a total of 745 mm irrigation and 1100 kg N ha–1 in two years. When farming practices were optimized for two harvests in 1 year system (2H1Y)OPT, then grain yield improved and water (18.12%) plus N (61.82%) consumptions were minimized. There was an ample amount of N saved, but water conservation was still unsatisfactory.

Thus, the introduction of crop diversification strategies and alternative management practices is crucial to re-design agricultural intensification systems. To better understand the contribution of crop diversification to more sustainable agricultural systems, an accurate evaluation of synergies and trade-offs is needed. In this context, the 5-year Horizon 2020 DIVERFARMING project aims to define sustainable, diversified cropping systems with low-input farming practices, adopting a multi-disciplinary approach. The overall objective of this study was to improve the understanding of the stakeholders’ perceptions of barriers and opportunities for implementing farming practices and crop diversification strategies in intensive rainfed and irrigated cereal-based cropping systems in Italy. Fifty stakeholders, grouped in farmers and technical agricultural advisors, field technical officers from public agricultural administrations, technical experts from NGOs with experience on farming practices, and researchers in agriculture, were engaged by public consultations to capture their practical knowledge of current farming practices for promoting suitable diversified cropping system, as alternative to agricultural intensification systems. The analysis of the stakeholders’ perceptions of barriers and opportunities to the transition of cropping systems towards diversification was done using a multi-criteria decision analysis The most important agro-environmental problem identified by the stakeholders in both the cropping systems was the loss of profitability, associated with the risk of farm abandonment, while minimum tillage, maintenance of vegetation covers, application of organic matter/manure and use of green manure, integrated pest management, and change of rotations were identified as the most adequate and effective practices to be adopted in the case study areas. Crop rotation and legumes were the most adequate diversification strategies selected for the intensive rainfed cereal-based cropping systems, while crop rotations with processing tomato and multiple cropping with short cycle maize and wheat were selected as the most appropriate alternatives for irrigated cereal-based production. Our findings highlight relevant strengths and drawbacks for the implementation of diversified cropping systems under low-input agricultural practices. An important strength is that the crop alternatives selected for the diversification are already cultivated as monocultures and are adapted to the local pedoclimatic conditions, while a major weakness is that few farmers are experts in crop diversification. These results can provide insights to support the planning of agricultural policies at different levels.",https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fenvs.2022.861225/pdf,

The primary objective of this study is to enhance environmental sustainability in this critical and vulnerable region, particularly in the face of imminent droughts and climate change. The study examines the impacts of climate change on agriculture and tourism in the area. It puts forward suggestions for implementing sustainable practices to safeguard the well-being of the local population. The results indicate a 38% reduction in precipitation, especially in the autumn season, with a possible alteration in the timing and strength of rainfall. Also, a notable decline in production volume, particularly in a specific region of the Ardabil plain, has been observed. The Ardabil Plain currently produces 284,182 tons of wheat, with 204,980 tons from irrigated crops and 79,202 tons from rain-fed crops. However, the projected future scenario indicates a decrease in total wheat production to 209,196 tons, with 160,125 tons from irrigated crops and 49,071 tons from rain-fed crops. This decline in production is expected to lead to a total net income loss of approximately -$75,389,059, with -$45,095,663 attributed to irrigated crops and -$30,293,396 to rain-fed crops. The study findings suggest that the availability of water sources in certain regions may prompt a shift in farming land from the north to the south of the plain to promote environmental sustainability. This demographic change could have significant financial and social implications for the region's growth and prosperity. Moreover, increasing temperatures in the western and northern regions pose flood risks and uncomfortable travel conditions, particularly concerning given the reliance on tourism and potential unemployment consequences.

Using multi-temporal Landsat images within the Python module for the Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land model, we investigated the spatiotemporal performance patterns of the Kou Valley irrigation scheme (KVIS) during two consecutive cropping seasons. Four performance indicators (depleted fraction, relative evapotranspiration, uniformity of water consumption, and crop water productivity) for rice, maize, and sweet potato were calculated and compared against standard values. Overall, the performance of the KVIS varied depending on year, crop, and the crop’s geographical position in the irrigation scheme. A gradient of spatially varied relative evapotranspiration was observed across the scheme, with the uniformity of water consumption being fair to good. Although rice was the most cultivated, a shift to more sweet potato farming could be adopted to benefit more from irrigation, given the relatively good performance achieved by this crop. Our findings ascertain the potential of such RS-based cost-effective methodologies to serve as basis for improved irrigation water management in decision support tools.",https://www.mdpi.com/2220-9964/9/8/484/pdf?version=1597140460,

The contribution of remote sensing observations for identifying the conditions under which rice is cultivated, particularly throughout the growing season, can be instrumental for water, and crop management. Data from different remote sensing platforms are being used in agriculture, namely to detecting anomalies in crops. This is attempted by calculating vegetation indices (VI) that are based on different vegetation reflectance bands, especially those that rely on the Red, Green, and near-infrared bands, such as the Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) or the Green Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (GNDVI). However, particular features of different crops and growing conditions justify that some indices are more adequate than others on a case-to-case basis, according to the different vegetation’s spectral signatures. In recent years, a vegetation index related to the Red Edge reflectance band, the Normalised Difference Red Edge (NDRE) has shown potential to be used as a tool to support agricultural management practices; this edge band, by taking a transition position, is very sensitive to changes in vegetation properties. This work, focusing on the rice crop and the application of different irrigation practices, explores the capability of several VIs calculated from different reflectance bands to detect variability, at the plot scale, in rice cultivation in the Lower Mondego region (Portugal). The remote sensing data were obtained from satellite Sentinel-2A imagery and using a multispectral camera mounted on an Unmanned Aerial System (UAS). By comparing several vegetation indices, we found that NDRE is particularly useful for identifying non-homogeneities in irrigation and crop growth in rice fields. Since few satellite sensors are sensible in the Red Edge band and none has the spatial resolution offered by UAS, this study explores the potential of UAS to be used as a useful support information tool in rice farming and precision agriculture, regarding irrigation, and agronomic management.",https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/frsen.2021.762093/pdf,

Considering the perspectives of survivors of a disaster event is critical for reducing the progression of vulnerability conditions. The Mbire community in Zimbabwe is facing increasing threats from recurring high- and low-magnitude floods that manifest themselves in the disruption of livelihoods and destruction of crops and infrastructure. This study, therefore, explored the perspectives of flood survivors on vulnerability to floods and examined their vulnerability-reduction measures. Using an interpretivist approach to knowledge generation, a sample of 51 research participants provided data through interviews, a focus group discussion and field observations. Results showed that shortage of land, flood-based farming practices, poverty and climate change, amongst others, are the key drivers of the smallholder farmers’ vulnerability to floods. The most affected groups of people include women, children and the elderly. To reduce their vulnerability, the smallholder farmers mainly rely on traditional flood-proofed structures built on stilts, dual home system and indigenous flood forecasting. The study proposes six policy implications to reduce vulnerability to floods. These include diversifying rural livelihoods beyond the farming sector, investment in irrigation infrastructure, increasing access to financial resources, constructing human settlements away from floodplains, enforcing environmental laws regarding flood-based farming and community education on the long-term negative impacts of recession farming. The implementation of these policy recommendations can contribute to community resilience to flood disasters.",https://jamba.org.za/index.php/jamba/article/download/663/1637,

Sathyanarayana Rao, Mahesh. Gowda, Kanchana. Ramachandran, Chittaranjan. Andrade There are substantial variations in the stated number of farmers committing suicide in India, each year, partly related to variations in the operationalization of the concept of farming as a profession. If these variations are ignored, and if data from the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) are accepted, it emerges that there have been 5650 farmer suicides in 1 year (2014), itself. Maharashtra is considered to be India's farmer suicide epicenter [sup][1] and has recorded 20,504 farmer suicides since 2001.[sup][2] Psychosocial Versus Socioeconomic Origins of Farmer Suicide Concerns about farmer suicide are not new, and studies on the subject have suggested different explanations for the act. One school of thought has suggested the primacy of an impaired mental health state, implying that the psychosocial needs of farmers have been neglected, and that caring community professionals need to address farmer distress.[sup][3] This school of thought additionally envisages a role for early psychiatric intervention as a primary preventive measure. In this connection, reports on the lack of psychiatrists offering to help have been of concern.[sup][4] However, there is evidence from studies in Karnataka, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, and other states in India that the role of socioeconomic stress in farmer suicide may be greater than the role of mental disorders.[sup][5],[6],[7],[8] Studies have not discovered conclusive evidence of psychiatric morbidity behind farmer suicides; rather these studies and other statistical data point toward severe socioeconomic adversity as the primary trigger. The NCRB 2014 data also support this conclusion as they indicate that almost 75% of the 5650 suicides that were recorded during 2014 were by small and marginal farmers holding up to two hectares of land; these sections of farmers are exposed to severe socioeconomic hardship. The same NCRB report attributed reasons such as bankruptcy, indebtedness, crop failure, and other farming-related issues to more than 60% of the suicide cases. It is therefore necessary to further investigate these adverse socioeconomic conditions and address the root cause of the suicide risk with the best pragmatic remedies. Socioeconomic Risk Factors in Farming Farming in India is a financially perilous profession with the annual farm income subject to many uncertainties. Farm work involves physical stress and can even be physically hazardous. There is psychological stress associated with coping with the regulatory framework and the dynamics of managing a farm business.[sup][9] The greatest risks, however, are economic in nature. More than 80% of Indian farmers have land holdings below two hectares. This fragmented and small land holding makes farming a risky economical proposition even under the best of conditions. In reality, the conditions are hardly anywhere near best. The smallness of the holding straightaway denies the farmers the benefits of mechanization, modern irrigation, and other investment-based technological improvements. As a result, productivity is suboptimal. The unpredictable, diminishing pattern of rainfall over India adversely impacts the farm output. Other climatic vagaries, such as hailstorms, can cause substantial crop damage. Migration from villages to towns and cities has decreased the availability of labor and increased its costs. The income earned from crops depends on the prevailing market situation, the greed of middlemen, the logistics of selling the produce, and other factors. Often, the government-administered minimum support price (MSP) may not even cover the cost of production. Consider, for example, the case of sugarcane production; the MSP is only INR 1000–1100 per unit against a production cost of INR 900–1000. On the surface, it appears that the farmer will make a (small) profit. …",https://doi.org/10.4103/psychiatry.indianjpsychiatry_89_17,

During 2015-16, along with partners, WWF-India conducted an action research study in over 2 million hectare of culturable command area of two irrigation systems taking off from River Ganga, to understand the barriers to implementation of Environmental Flows (E-Flows) in the Ganga. Under this initiative, the team tried to bridge the knowledge gap about potential trade-offs for implementation of E-Flows in a critical stretch of Ganga. The team made an attempt to understand the surface water allocation and water use scenario in western and central part of the state of Uttar Pradesh, where the Ganga water is used for agriculture purpose through major irrigation infrastructure. The E-Flows recommendations for critical locations downstream of two barrages, i.e. head-works of two major irrigation schemes, were developed. A framework was developed to assess the costs and benefits of various flow regimes. Such a framework helps discuss the trade-offs emerging from E-Flows releases onto other committed allocations across various users. This paper discusses approaches for management of trade-offs to restore E-Flows in this stretch of Ganga, and include various management options – like (i) promotion of irrigation water use efficiency, (ii) gradual and marginal shift in land towards less-water intensive crops and (iii) institutional aspects. The paper argues that, whilst there is a widespread apprehension that, any curtailment in the allocation quota for irrigation would lead to adverse impact onto the farming community; but actually after assessing the trade-offs, it can be inferred that, the E-Flows implementation in this stretch of Ganga would require enhancement of water in the river, but that requirement is not substantial. Towards the end of the paper, challenges and opportunities for E-Flows implementation in the Upper Ganga are discussed.

This may, however, have limited effect on yield if the availability of effective pollinators is too low. In this study, we established an experiment to test whether soil fertility, soil moisture, and/or pollination was limiting watermelon (Citrullus lanatus) yields in Northern Tanzania. We subjected the experimental field to common farming practices while we treated selected plants with extrafertilizer applications, increased irrigation and/or extra pollination in a three‐way factorial experiment. One week before harvest, we assessed yield from each plant, quantified as the number of mature fruits and their weights. We also assessed fruit shape since this may affect the market price. For the first fruit ripening on each plant, we also assessed sugar content (brix) and flesh color as measures of fruit quality for human consumption. Extra pollination significantly increased the probability of a plant producing a second fruit of a size the farmer could sell at the market, and also the fruit sugar content, whereas additional fertilizer applications or increased irrigation did not improve yields. In addition, we did not find significant effects of increased fertilizer or watering on fruit sugar, weight, or color. We concluded that, insufficient pollination is limiting watermelon yields in our experiment and we suggest that this may be a common situation in sub‐Saharan Africa. It is therefore critically important that small‐scale farmers understand the role of pollinators and understand their importance for agricultural production. Agricultural policies to improve yields in developing countries should therefore also include measures to improve pollination services by giving education and advisory services to farmers on how to develop pollinator‐friendly habitats in agricultural landscapes.",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1002/ece3.6278,

Deionized (DI) water was treated for 5 or 10 min using the gliding arc discharge (GAD) system, which was operated by line frequency in the air. Water analysis indicates that the physiochemical parameters (electrical conductivity, pH, nitrate, nitrite, and ammonia concentration) of PAW were significantly different from DI water. Despite exposure to GAD for a certain period of time, the temperature of DI water did not alter significantly. All calculated germination parameters were significantly enhanced for seeds treated with PAW compared to the control. In addition, they displayed a significant increase in total seedling length and exhibited greater vigor. Seeds immersed in PAW absorbed significantly more water than seeds soaked in DI water, enabling rapid water penetration into the seed and early seedling emergence. This puts plasma agriculture ahead of conventional farming methods.",https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4441/15/4/744/pdf?version=1676364244,

Throughout history, different techniques have been used to ensure sustainable urban agricultural production. A good example of this is the chinampa system, which was developed during the time of the Aztecs in the region of Lake Xochimilco, south of Mexico City. A chinampa is a raised field on a small artificial island on a freshwater lake surrounded by canals and ditches. Farmers use local vegetation and mud to construct chinampas. Fences made of a native willow [bonpland willow (Salix bonplandiana)] protect the chinampa from wind, pests, and erosion. The dominating crops are vegetables and ornamentals. The canal water that rises through capillarity to the crops reduces the need for additional irrigation. A considerable portion of the fertility in the soils is system-immanent and generated in the aquatic components of the chinampa. Complex rotations and associations allow up to seven harvests per year. Chinampas also provide ecosystem services, particularly greenhouse gas sequestration and biodiversity diversification, and they offer high recreational potential. Recently, research and community initiatives have been performed to try to recover the productive potential of chinampas and align this sustainable system with the needs of the 21st century. In other parts of the world, some with a history of raised field agriculture, similar efforts are being made.

It represents more than half of the remaining tropical forest on Earth and covers the catchment basin of the Amazon river on which 20% of the surface fresh water on the planet flows. Such an ecosystem produces large quantities of water vapor, helping regulate rainfall regimes in most of South America, with strong economic implications: for instance, by irrigating crops and pastures, and supplying water for the main hydroelectric plants in the continent. Being the natural habitat of one-tenth of the currently known species, the Amazon also has enormous biotechnological potential. Among the major menaces to the Amazon is the extension of agricultural and cattle farming, forest fires, illegal mining and logging, all directly associated with deforestation. Preserving the Amazon is obviously essential, and it is well-known that remote sensing provides effective tools for environmental monitoring. This work presents a deforestation detection approach based on the DeepLabv3+, a fully convolutional deep learning model devised for semantic segmentation. The proposed method extends the original DeepLabv3+ model, aiming at properly dealing with a strong class imbalanced problem and improving the delineation quality of deforestation polygons. Experiments were devised to evaluate the proposed method in terms of the sensitivity to the weighted focal loss hyperparameters—through an extensive grid search—and the amount of training data, and compared its performance to previous deep learning methods proposed for deforestation detection. Landsat OLI-8 images of a specific region in the Amazon were used in such evaluation. The results indicate that the variants of the proposed method outperformed previous works in terms of the F1-score and Precision metrics. Additionally, more substantial performance gains were observed in the context of smaller volumes of training data. When the evaluated methods were trained using four image tiles, the proposed method outperformed its counterparts by approximately +10% in terms of F1-score (from 63% to 73%); when the methods were trained with only one image tile, the performance difference in terms of F1-score achieved approximately +18% (from 49% to 67%).",https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/14/19/4694/pdf?version=1663897922,

Organic growers overcome the restrictions of use synthetic pesticides by selection suitable resistant varieties but they may meet the problem to sell a new product (variety) on the market. Another problem is the possibility of development of a new pest or pathogen populations overcoming existing resistance. New races of Venturia inaequalis causing apple scab in resistant varieties carrying Rvi6 and Rvi7 genes represent a typical example (Gessler et al., 2006). Therefore besides of newly bred resistant cultivars, organic growers need innovative cultivation technologies to ensure good yield and high quality of production. One approach is low input management using pests and disease selfregulatory mechanisms by supporting natural benefi cial organisms in orchards (Laer, 2010; Weibel et al., 2010). However this management is still somewhat uncertain in intensive fruit plantations. Therefore artifi cial introduction and application of benefi cial organisms (bioagens) are more widely used. Success of organic farming is highly encouraged by advances in the fi eld of knowledge about plant defence mechanism which leads to using biocontrol agents and natural plant elicitors to enhance natural plant defence responses (AmilRuiz et al., 2011). Induced systemic resistance is a phenomenon whereby resistance to pathogen 20 S. Boček, P. Salaš, H. Sasková, J. Mokričková is systematically induced by local infection or treatment with microbial components or products or by a diverse group of structurally unrelated organic and inorganic compounds (Kuć, 2001). In order to reduce or replace copper fungicides not only in organic production, sulfuric clays are tested to control pathogens (Dorn et al., 2007; Michelante and Haine, 2004). In organic growing sulfuric clays are successfully introduced into the protection strategies, mainly in apples (Jamar and Lateur, 2007; Jamar et al., 2010; Kelderer et al., 2010; Kunz et al., 2011; Falta and Vávra, 2010). Natural compounds used as elicitors of induced systemic resistance off er new prospects for controlling diseases in organic production (Lateur, 2002; Kaufmann et al., 2009). Seaweed extracts are tested in horticultural crops not only for control diseses (Washington et al., 1999; Prokkola et al., 2007; Loyola and Muñoz, 2009; Parikka et al., 2009; Malusa et al., 2010) but also as biostimulants and fertilizers (Crouch et al., 1993; Paszt et al., 2011; Malusa et al., 2012). Strawberry (Fragaria × grandifl ora Ehr.) is a popular horticultural crop widely grown in organic system, although it can be challenged with many pests and pathogens. Grey mould caused by the fungus Botrytis cinerea Pers. ex Fr. is one of the most important disease of strawberries in humid climate. Therefore there is an eff ort to fi nd out protection methods involving biological control using fungal or bacterial microorganisms (Peng and Sutton, 1991; Swadling and Jeff ries, 1996; Adikaram et al., 2002; Donmez et al., 2011). Mycoparasitic fungus Pythium oligandrum Drechs. can be used for biological control in a wide spectrum of crops by its ability to attack fungal plant pathogens (Brožová, 2002) and to induce systemic resistance due to elicitinlike proteins POD-1, POD-2, POS-1 and oligandrin (Masunaka et al., 2010). Several studies proved oligandrin to be eff ective in pathogen control in strawberries and other horticultural crops (Picard et al. 2000; Benhamou et al., 2001; Mohamed et al., 2007; Wang et al., 2011). Lou et al. (2011) explain the ability of oligandrin to induce resistance against Botrytis cinerea in tomatoes by eliciting production of PR-2a and PR-3a (genes related to pathogenesis) and by increasing of defence enzymes POD, PPO and PAL in host plant. This work is the output of a pilot project focused on the development of methods for commercial organic strawberry growing in the Czech Republic, where actually only hobby growers produce strawberries without chemical treatment. The aim of the present study was to test several bio preparations to fi nd out their diseases control eff ectiveness and to assess their impact on yield and quality variables. The fi eld experiment was conducted to prove effi cacy of commercial plant protective agents Alginure® (seaweed extract), Myco-Sin®VIN (clay mineral with horsetail extract) and Polyversum® (spores of Pythium oligandrum) on yield, fruit quality and health status of strawberry cv. ‘Induka’ under the organic system conditions.

The locality is situated in Southern Moravia and is characterized by silty soils, altitude 179 m, mean year temperature 9 °C, mean year precipitation 517 mm. The soil was prepared two years according to the rules of organic agriculture using three kinds of green manure every year – phacelia, white mustard and mixture of fi eld pea with oat, respectively.

However, the implementation of such schemes is often hindered by inappropriate institutional environments and inefficient project management. It is important to assess the impacts of such intercropping programs, especially since such a cultivation strategy can often align closely with smallholders’ livelihood strategies, particularly in poor and remote rural regions. This paper attempts to assess the impact of an intercropping program on participants’ incomes in rural Xinjiang (China), and to explore the possible shortcomings in the program’s design and implementation. We apply a propensity score matching method, based on a survey dataset of 352 households, supplemented with descriptive analysis based on our anecdotal field observations. The findings demonstrate that the intercropping program had negative effects on the incomes that participants derived from farming, their off-farm income and their gross income. Overall, participants experienced significant losses of income. Anecdotal observations show that land tenure insecurity played a crucial role in negating the anticipated income improvement effect of this program. Farmer’s perceptions that they have limited security of tenure made them reluctant to invest the necessary time and resources to make the new cropping systems a success, while the available subsidies only partially covered the costs involved. In addition, the program led to a significant drop in yields of field crops as the trees were competing for a limiting and fixed supply of irrigation water.",https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/9/9/1542/pdf?version=1504098017,

Despite the essential role of the root system in determining attainable yields, roots have been historically overlooked as the hidden half of plants (Manske and Vlek, 2002; Waisel et al., 1991) and rarely targeted by agricultural crop improvements. With a higher frequency of drought in the context of climate change, and considering that water limitation is a major yield-limiting factor that is increasingly prevalent in temperate regions, plant breeding efforts have started to search for approaches that integrate the root system into the stress tolerance portfolio for trait-based crop improvement. There are several lines of evidence, which show that targeting the root system in the breeding process is highly promising for improving yield stability and crop performance in stress inducing environments. Some biologists, physiologists and breeders involved in plant root research consider the root system to be the key to a second green revolution, which does not rely on expensive inputs (e.g., Gewin, 2010). © 2020 Institute of Agrophysics, Polish Academy of Sciences Review T. STŘEDA et al. 174 Root systems for crop improvement – which trait to select for? The measurement of root characteristics is made difficult by the environment in which the roots develop. In fact, the size of the roots has not been used as a criterion for selection in practical breeding efforts (with the exception of root crops – sugar beet, carrot, etc.), although every new selection criterion initially shows a prompt response to selection as a rule. A rare practical outcome of this was the cultivation of wheat with reduced hydraulic conductivity of the vessels of the root system xylem in Australia’s arid climate (Richards and Passioura, 1989). An important question is which characteristics should be selected by breeders to obtain drought-tolerant plants. Selecting a suitable variety (based on the root system properties) for a specific area may be the key to a grower’s success. For example, deep-rooted varieties may be successful in dry years in soils with a higher water table. Gregory et al. (1978) found that only 3% of the total wheat root biomass occurred at a depth of 1 m, and this small portion provided up to 20% of the water needed for transpiration during the summer months. Kirkegaard et al. (2007) reported an increase in the grain yield of wheat by 59 kg ha per 1 mm of water delivered to a layer of 1.35-1.85 m during drought stress after flowering. Additionally, the topology of the root system, e.g., the different branching angles of the seminal roots in wheat (Manschadi, 2006), is related to the water uptake efficiency. A larger root system is considered to be an advantage, especially in the absence of sufficient water and nutrients, in a less fertile environment and in organic farming (Comas et al., 2013; Svačina et al., 2014), for enabling a more effective use of the nutrients from the soil, and thus lowering the contamination of the environment with unused nutrients, especially nitrogen and phosphorus (Gewin, 2010; KlimekKopyra and Rębilas, 2018). However, a higher root density did not always lead to an increase in nitrogen consumption (Wendling et al., 2016; Feng et al., 2016; Herrera et al., 2010). When comparing old and modern wheat varieties, Aziz et al. (2017) discovered that the root length density and total length of the root system decreased with ongoing breeding processes, but the efficiency of nitrogen uptake increased. Genotypes with superior root characteristics for efficient nutrient uptake should be developed in breeding programmes to increase grain yield and to minimize nitrate leaching (Ehdaie et al., 2010; Robinson et al., 2018), and appropriate phenotypes must be precisely identified for intentional breeding. Despite improvements in molecular technologies, fast and accurate phenotyping remains the major bottleneck to enhancing yield gains in water-limited environments (Richards et al., 2010). However, the shallow topsoil profiles of stony soils are inappropriate for deep-rooted varieties. Blum (2005) considers plants with a deep reaching extensive root system to be ill suited for conditions of rapid drying of the upper layer of the soil, which (by its mechanical properties) prevents the pronounced proliferation of roots. Growth is then curtailed, so that the genetic potential for long roots remains unused. In contrast, Richards (1991) stated that, for some environments, the formation of fewer roots in the upper soil layer may be an effective adaptation to drought. This could be related to the conclusions of Campos et al. (2004), who investigated the water obtained by the root system of old and modern varieties of maize. The old varieties showed a higher depletion of water predominantly from the upper parts of the soil profile. In particular, the depletion of water in the soil prior to the beginning of flowering was the reason for a more pronounced decline in the yield of older varieties compared to that of modern hybrids. The “Green Revolution” resulted in dwarf varieties of wheat capable of responding to higher fertilizer inputs, but they failed to reach resource-poor farmers. Crossing early green revolution wheat varieties, with an F2 of Norin 10 or Brevor, reduced root biomass. Later generation, semi-dwarf wheat showed a genetic variation in root biomass, but some generations exhibited a further reduction in root size (Waines and Ehdaie, 2007). From this point of view, the optimal regionalization of varieties with a larger root system is essential. Optimally, it is also desirable to take into account the root system morphology of a particular variety (the depth of the root system) or the dynamics of root growth during vegetative growth. Significant correlations between the root system size of barley in the stage of stem elongation during moderate drought stress and the seed vigour of progenies were found by Vintrlíková et al. (2015). It is likely that the increase in the root system of parents during drought stress conditions has enabled the rapid growth of the roots of progenies at the beginning of the vegetation period. However, a large sized root system is not always a great advantage. For example, if drought does not occur, then the development of a larger root system was an unnecessary investment for the plant at the expense of other photosynthetic products. The precise targeting of a variety to a particular area of cultivation may serve as the basis for the success and economic prosperity of farmers. For an improved exploitation of the available water, an adequate distribution of roots in the soil profile is preferable to a higher dry matter content of the roots (Bänziger et al., 2000). In cereals, root densities of 1.0-1.5 cm cm are required for the plant to extract the available water from the soil (Passioura, 1980; Vamerali et al., 2003). Lynch (2013) characterized the maize ideotype for its optimal uptake of water and mobile nutrients as steep, cheap and deep. This promotes the phenotypic or genotypic selection of a larger (deeper) root system in cereals. Fitter (2002) reported that high values of SRL (specific root length; root length per root weight unit) indicates the high ability of the roots to obtain nutrients. Similarly, Gonzalez-Dugo (2010) reported that the availability of FIELD PHENOTYPING OF PLANT ROOTS – A STANDARDIZED METHODOLOGICAL PROTOCOL 175 nitrogen is largely determined by root density. Palta et al. (2011) demonstrated significantly higher nitrogen and water absorption in wheat lines with a more vital root system at a depth of up to 0.7 m. Herrera et al. (2010) described the importance of the fast growth of the roots in deep soil layers at the beginning of the vegetation period, which may lower nitrogen losses through leaching. The fast growth of the root system of field crops is vital in order to prevent nitrates from leaching to deeper layers of the soil profile, however, the role of the root system in nitrogen uptake efficiency is still a point of controversy (Palta and Watt, 2009). A larger investment by a crop in fine roots that are deeper in the soil and fewer roots in surface layers would improve yields by allowing plants to access additional resources (King et al., 2003). Bertholdsson and Kolodinska Brantestam (2009) showed the importance of early vigour for drought tolerance and the development of finer roots in modern barley cultivars. It may be concluded that there is a large variation in root system characteristics and the functional strategies of plants within a given species. This is, on the one hand, a positive finding (varietal selection for superior root system traits is possible). On the other hand, it is necessary to factor in varietal differences in the creation and interpretation of experiments. Being critical to the integrity of the plant, the root system parameters affect the efficiency of the whole plant. Roots are very sensitive to soil conditions and are often the first organ of a plant that responds to stress. The adaptability of the root system confirms the excellent ability of roots to change their morphological properties to achieve the optimal growth of the whole plant. With a degree of generalization, it may be stated that deep-rooted varieties can be recommended in areas with a high water retention capacity in the subsoil. Varieties with a large, shallow root system may be recommended in drier areas with regular, lower amounts of precipitation, during which only the upper layer of the soil profile is moistened (Tron et al., 2015). The field phenotyping gap An ideal method for evaluating root systems should allow the researcher to obtain a detailed characterization of a wide range of root system parameters with a sufficiently large number of measurements.

One aspect of modern society in which application of wireless communication technologies has tremendous potential is in agricultural production. This is especially true in the area of sensing and transmission of relevant farming information such as weather, crop development, water quantity and quality, among others, which would allow farmers to make more accurate and timely farming decisions. A good example would be the application of wireless communication technology to transmit soil moisture data in real time to help farmers make irrigation scheduling decisions. Although many systems are commercially available for soil moisture monitoring, there are still many important factors, such as cost, limiting widespread adoption of this technology among growers. Our objective in this study was, therefore, to develop and test an affordable wireless communication system for monitoring soil moisture using Decagon EC-5 sensors. The new system uses Arduino-compatible microcontrollers and communication systems to sample and transmit values from four Decagon EC-5 soil moisture sensors. Developing the system required conducting lab calibrations for the EC-5 sensors for the microcontroller operating in either 10-bit or 12-bit analog-to-digital converter (ADC) resolution. The system was successfully tested in the field and reliably collected and transmitted data from a wheat field for more than two months.",http://www.scirp.org/journal/PaperDownload.aspx?paperID=79962,

As a result of this transformation, irrigation has become, together with agricultural machinery, the primary consumer of energy within the agri-food sector. Furthermore, the energy cost of operating pumping equipment during a farming season represents 30–40% of the crop’s total cost. For this reason, one of the most interesting challenges in this scope is that of improving energy efficiency and reducing economic costs so that productive work become more and more competitive. Energy audit makes possible to determine the efficiency of installations, and enables to determine energy saving protocols (requirements), for this reason the aim of this article is to carry out these by using IoT-based systems. The proposed system improves decision-making on agricultural pumping management by classifying wells’ efficiency and integrating the data sets that determine their efficiency into a single information model. The system monitors energy efficiency according to different parameters such as: infrastructure, energy consumption, electric rates, manometric height or type of installation, making it possible to enhance each pumping operation’s decisions. This solution has been deployed in an irrigation community in southeast Spain whose results have warned about the lack of efficiency in two of its wells: in one of them it is proposed that they be replaced, due to the high cost of pumping water, and in the other, hydraulic mechanisms are implemented to improve the water-energy binomial.",https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9292/10/3/250/pdf?version=1611719581,

Urban agriculture is an informal activity not supported by law but in practice is regulated to a certain extent by state institutions, traditional rulers, farmers and national and international non-governmental organisations. Tamale’s rapid population growth, exacerbated by the unplanned development system and institutional conflicts, are factors contributing to the present bottlenecks in the urban agricultural system. In this paper, these bottlenecks are conceptualised as problems of governance. These issues will be illustrated using ethnographic data from land sales, crop-livestock competition, waste-water irrigation, and markets. I will explain how conflicts which arise from these different situations are resolved through the interactions of various governance systems. Informal governance arrangements are widespread, but neither they nor formal systems are always successful in resolving governance issues. A participatory governance does not seem possible due to actors’ divergent interests.

Precision agriculture, weed control, fertilizer distribution, and field management benefit from unmanned ariel vehicles (UAVs). Reduced production costs and improved crop quality are some of the benefits of using this method. Smart farming denotes geographical data utilization to identify field variability, guarantee optimal inputs, and enhance a farm’s output. Hence, in this paper, an IoT-assisted Smart Farming Framework (IoT-SFF) with big data analytics has been proposed using geospatial analysis. The use of wireless sensors in IoT devices and communication methods in agricultural applications is thoroughly examined. IoT sensors are available for particular agriculture applications, such as crop status, soil preparation, insect, pest detection, and irrigation scheduled. It is now possible to view our regions in various ways and make accurate agrotechnological decisions, thanks to a computer-generated geographic information system (GIS) for crop irrigation and monitoring. Analytical and monitoring processes that yield timely and accurate decision-making add value to big data, which is a key component for intelligently managing and operating farms. Still, it is constrained by both technical and socioeconomic variables. The simulation findings show that the proposed IoT-SFF model improves the crop yield ratio by 92.4%, prediction ratio by 97.7%, accuracy ratio by 94.5%, the average error by 38.3%, and low-cost rate by 34.4%.",https://downloads.hindawi.com/journals/misy/2023/4213645.pdf,

Moreover, water abstraction, not least for irrigation purposes, is expected to increase markedly, posing major threats to the water balance of the lakes and thus their biodiversity. Among the closed basins in Turkey, the Burdur Closed Basin (BCB), located in the southwest of Turkey, is expected to be most affected. The BCB includes several types of aquatic ecosystems which support high biodiversity, including one Ramsar site, six Important Bird Areas, and a considerable richness of native and endemic fish species. Therefore, it is essential to analyze the potential environmental impacts of climate change and increased water abstraction on BCB lakes and their biotic communities. Here, we combined historical data on ecosystems as well as meteorological, remote sensing, and ground-truth data to analyze the changes in the temperature and precipitation of the BCB, water surface areas, and land use, as well as the potential effects on waterbird and fish communities. We calculated the water budget to elucidate water availability in the basin over the last few decades and predicted future conditions based on rainfall and temperature forecasts using climate models. The Standardized Precipitation–Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) was used to relate the water surface area to precipitation and temperature change in the basin. Crop-farming irrigation in the BCB has increased notably since 2004, leading to intensive water abstraction from the lakes and their inflows, as well as from ground water, to meet the increased demand for irrigation. The water abstraction from the lakes, inflows to the lakes, and the groundwater in the basin has increased the water loss in the catchment substantially. Remotely sensed data on lake surface areas showed a major shrinkage of shallow lakes in the last 40 years. Moreover, the largest lake in the basin, Lake Burdur, lost nearly half of its surface area, which is worrisome since the shallower areas are the most suitable for supporting high biodiversity. Climate models (CNRM-ESM2-1GCM for temperature and GFDL-ESM4-GCM for precipitation) suggest that from 2070, the BCB will face long-term, moderate-to-severe dry periods. This, and the increased demand for water for irrigation, along with climate change, may accelerate the drying of these lakes in the near future with devastating effects on the lake ecosystems and their biodiversity.",https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4441/14/8/1241/pdf?version=1649898527,

The innovative techniques of organic farming, namely with soil fertility, weed and pest control, opens a wide range of possibilities in its development and extension. The expectation of organic farming profitability in small-scale family farming, supported by known successful examples, were the theme of a field study on Lis Valley Irrigation District to assess the constraints to its expansion in order to outline the procedures for the acquisition of technical knowledge, the adaptation of technologies, the support for the conversion of production models, and the specialized training of farmers for action.

Application of BSAAO's must be done cautiously, as raw manure commonly contains enteric foodborne pathogens that can potentially contaminate edible produce that may be consumed without cooking. USDA National Organic Program (NOP) certified production systems follow the 90-or 120-day interval standards between applications of untreated BSAAOs and crop harvest, depending on whether the edible portions of the crops are in indirect or direct contact with the soil, respectively. This study was conducted to evaluate the survival of four foodborne pathogens in soils amended with BSAAOs and to examine the potential for bacterial transfer to fresh produce harvested from USDA NOP certified organic farms (19) from four states. Only 0.4% (2/527) of produce samples were positive for L. monocytogenes. Among the untreated manure and compost samples, 18.0% (42/233) were positive for at least one of the tested and culturable bacterial foodborne pathogens.

Results indicate that produce contamination by tested foodborne pathogens was infrequent, but these data should not be generalized outside of the specific wait-time regulations for organic crop production and the farms studied. Moreover, other sources of contamination, e.g., irrigation, wildlife, environmental conditions, cropping and management practices, should be considered. This study also provides multi-regional baseline data relating to current NOP application intervals and development of potential risk mitigation strategies to reduce pathogen persistence in soils amended with BSAAOs.
