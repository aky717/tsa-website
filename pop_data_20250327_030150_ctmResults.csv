Owing to its significant influence on catchment hydrological responses, it can be utilized as an indicator of floods and droughts to aid early warning systems. This study aimed to develop a field‐scale method to estimate SM using parametric and machine learning‐based methods to compare whether advanced artificial intelligence methods can give similar results as traditional methods. Considering this, monthly observed SM data (from the top 10 cm), environmental covariates, and remotely sensed data from March 2019 to July 2021 for the Cathedral Peak Research Catchments VI and IX in South Africa were obtained. From the 241 observations obtained across 12 sites, 160 (∼66%) were used for model training, while the remaining 81 (∼34%) were used for model testing. Employing 10‐fold cross‐validation, the individual machine learning models (viz., support vector machine [SVM], random forest (RF), k‐nearest neighbor, classification and regression trees [Rpart], and generalized linear model) displayed a satisfactory performance (R2 = 0.52–0.79; root mean square error = 3.79–5.80). In the validation phase, the RF model displayed a superior performance, followed by the SVM. Subsequent SM estimation using the hybrid model produced satisfactory results in training (R2 = 0.90) and testing (R2 = 0.45). The results obtained from this study can aid in predicting SM variations in catchments with limited monitoring. Furthermore, this model can be applied in drought monitoring, forecasting, and informing agricultural management practices.","Genetic diversity in 30 date palm (Phoenix dactylifera L.) cultivars in Iraq representing 24 female and six male cultivars was investigated using 22 microsatellite [simple sequence repeat (SSR)] primers. The tested SSR markers showed a high level of polymorphism. A total of 188 alleles were detected at the 22 loci ranging from three to 21 with an average of 8.54 alleles per locus. The average of heterozygosity for all cultivars was 0.503; genetic distance among cultivars varied from 0.171 to 0.938 indicating diverse relationships. The cultivar Ghanami Akhder was highly divergent from ‘Ghnami Ahmer’, whereas ‘Jamal Al-Dean’ was very closely related to ‘Qitaz’. Unweighted pair group method arithmetic average ordered date palm cultivars into two main clusters. Principal coordinate analysis exhibited the similar clusters of cultivars as in the dendrogram. Date palm (2n = 2x = 36) is considered of great socioeconomic importance in the Arabian region. The tree has been, and is still, at the center of comprehensive agricultural development. It is believed to have originated from Mesopotamia (Wrigley, 1995). The numbers of known date palm cultivars that are distributed all over the world are 5000 of which 600 are found in Iraq. Iraq is one of the largest date-producing countries in the world. Before 1991, Iraq was the largest producer of dates in the world (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, 2008) and had the largest date forest in the world (MacFarquhar, 2003). However, during the Gulf and Iran–Iraq wars, large numbers of date palm trees were destroyed. Wars and sanctions imposed on Iraq have negatively affected both the production and natural genetic diversity of the crop in Iraq and inhibited the much-needed impetus to rebuild the date palm industry. Development of suitable DNA molecular markers for this crop may allow researchers to estimate genetic diversity, which will ultimately lead to the genetic conservation of date palm. The success of particular genetic conservation or breeding programs is dependent on understanding the amount and distribution of the genetic variation already present in the genetic pool (Jubrael et al., 2005). Morphological traits have been used to describe such genetic variation in date palm cultivars (Barreveld, 1993), which are mainly related to the fruit and influenced by the environment (Askari and Al-Khalifah, 2003; Sedra et al., 1993, 1998). In addition, biochemical studies, including isozyme and activity analyses of peroxidases, have been used to characterize date palms in Morocco and Tunisia (Baaziz, 1988; Baaziz and Saaidi, 1988; Bendiab et al., 1998; Majourhat et al., 2002; Ould Salem Mohamed et al., 2001). As such, analysis does not reflect precisely that polymorphisms occurred (Al-Jibouri and Adham, 1990). DNA marker analysis in date palm is recently in the development stage. Askari and Al-Khalifah (2003) analyzed the genetic diversity among 13 different cultivars using random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) markers. Similar reports are published for North African cultivars (Hussein et al., 2002; Sedra et al., 1998). Amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) markers (Vos et al., 1995) were also been used for genetic fingerprinting and mapping for this crop. Jubrael et al., (2005) and Khierallah et al. (2011) used AFLP fingerprinting to characterize a number of Iraqi date palm cultivars. Microsatellites, also known as SSR, are ideal DNA markers for population studies and genetic mapping as a result of their abundance, high level of polymorphism, dispersion throughout diverse genomes, ease to assay by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and ease to disseminate among laboratories (Udupa and Baum, 2001). Microsatellite markers were used for investigation of genetic diversity in date palm (Billotte et al., 2004). Zehdi et al. (2004) applied these markers to characterize Tunisian cultivars, whereas Al-Ruqaishi et al. (2008) used these primers to screen and analyze the genetic diversity among clonal genotypes of Omani cultivars. Recently, many researchers in date palm-producing countries have used SSR markers to genotype cultivars. Elshibli and Korpelainen (2008) investigated genetic diversity in Sudan germplasm representing 37 female and 23 male accessions using 16 SSR primers. In Qatar, Ahmed and Al-Qaradawi (2009) used 10 primers to analyze genetic Received for publication 27 Jan. 2011. Accepted for publication 24 June 2011.

(2010) developed 1000 SSR markers in date palm, mining genome sequencing data for this vital crop. The aim of this study is intended to characterize the genotype for 30 Iraqi important date palm cultivars using SSR markers. Materials and Methods PLANT MATERIALS. Leaves were collected from 30 welldefined reference Iraqi date palm cultivars grown in date palm stations belong to the Ministry of Agriculture (Table 1). Twenty-two female cultivar samples were collected from AlMahaweel Date Palm Station, Hilla Governorate, 80 km south of Baghdad. The remaining eight cultivar samples were collected from Al-Za’afarania Date Palm Station, Baghdad (Fig. 1). Total genomic DNA was extracted from young and healthy leaves according to the procedure mentioned by Benito et al. (1993) with minor modifications. After purification, the resultant DNA was quantified on 1% agarose gel electrophoresis as described by Sambrook et al. (1989). MICROSATELLITE AMPLIFICATION. A total of 33 date palmspecific primer pairs were tested; 16 of them were developed by Billotte et al. (2004) and 17 were developed by Akkak et al. (2009) as indicated in Table 2. PCR was performed in a total mixture of 20 mL containing: 13.9 mL H2O, 50 ng of total cellular DNA (2 mL) as template, 1 mL/PCR buffer (Roche, Mannheim, Germany), 1 mL of 0.2 mM of dNTP PCR mix (Roche), 0.1 mL (0.625 U) of Taq DNA polymerase (Roche) and1 mL of 0.2 mM of each primer using forward primer end labeled (6FAM, NED, or TET). Amplifications were performed in a thermocycler (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA) under the following conditions: a denaturation step of 5 min at 95 C followed by 35 cycles of 30 s at 95 C, 1 min at 52 C and 1 min at 72 C, and a final extension step at 72 C for 7 min. At the testing stage, amplification products were separated by electrophoresis according to their molecular weight in 1.4% agarose gels and then detected by staining with ethidium bromide as described by Sambrook et al. (1989). The DNA profiles were visualized on an ultraviolet transilluminator and documented by using a gel documentation system (Alpha Innotech Imaging Station; Cell Biosciences, Santa Clara, CA). For final analyses, 2 mL of amplified DNA (diluted to 1/10) and 8 mL of (Rox) DNA standard size (Applied Biosystems) were loaded into 96-well plates. Genotyping was carried out using an automatic DNA analyzer (Model 3100; Applied Biosystems). Amplifications were performed at least twice and only reproducible products were taken into account for further data analysis. SIMPLE SEQUENCE REPEAT GENOTYPING. Electropherogram data were analyzed by using Foundation Data Collection software (Genetic Analyser Data Collection Version 2.0; Applied Biosystems). Allele size scoring was performed by Gene Mapper software (Version 3.7; Applied Biosystems). The Jaccard similarity matrix (Jaccard, 1908) was used for cluster analysis using the unweighted pair group method arithmetic average to study the genetic relationships among the cultivars. Jaccard similarity index, major allele frequency, heterozygosity, gene diversity, and polymorphism information content estimation were done using a software package (PowerMarker Version 1.31; Liu and Muse 2005). The phylogenetic diagram was drawn by PAST software [Version 1.91 (Hammer et al., 2001)] on the basis of Hamming similarity index with 100 bootstrap. Principal coordinate analysis (PCA) was performed according to Euclidean similarity index using the PAST software.","Effective drought management requires precise measurement, but this is challenging due to the variety of drought indices and indicators, each with unique methods and specific uses, and limited ground data availability. This study utilizes remote sensing data from 2001 to 2020 to compute drought indices categorized as meteorological, agricultural, and hydrological. A Gaussian kernel convolves these indices into a denoised, multi-band composite image. Further refinement with a Gaussian kernel enhances a single drought index from each category: Reconnaissance Drought Index (RDI), Soil Moisture Agricultural Drought Index (SMADI), and Streamflow Drought Index (SDI). The enhanced index, encompassing all bands, serves as a predictor for classification and regression tree (CART), support vector machine (SVM), and random forest (RF) machine learning models, further improving the three indices. CART demonstrated the highest accuracy and error minimization across all drought categories, with root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) values between 0 and 0.4. RF ranked second, while SVM, though less reliable, achieved values below 0.7. The results show persistent drought in the Sahel, North Africa, and southwestern Africa, with meteorological drought affecting 30% of Africa, agricultural drought affecting 22%, and hydrological drought affecting 21%.","Fruit-tree crops generate food and income for local households and contribute to South Africa’s gross domestic product. Timely and accurate phenotyping of fruit-tree crops is essential for innovating and achieving precision agriculture in the horticulture industry. Traditional methods for fruit-tree crop classification are time-consuming, costly, and often impossible to use for mapping heterogeneous horticulture systems. The application of remote sensing in smallholder agricultural landscapes is more promising. However, intercropping systems coupled with the presence of dispersed small agricultural fields that are characterized by common and uncommon crop types result in imbalanced samples, which may limit conventionally applied classification methods for phenotyping. This study assessed the influence of balanced and imbalanced multi-class distribution and data-sampling techniques on fruit-tree crop detection accuracy. Seven data samples were used as input to adaptive boosting (AdaBoost), gradient boosting (GB), random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and eXtreme gradient boost (XGBoost) machine learning algorithms. A pixel-based approach was applied using Sentinel-2 (S2). The SVM algorithm produced the highest classification accuracy of 71%, compared with AdaBoost (67%), RF (65%), XGBoost (63%), and GB (62%), respectively. Individually, the majority of the crop types were classified with an F1 score of between 60% and 100%. In addition, the study assessed the effect of size and ratio of class imbalance in the training datasets on algorithms’ sensitiveness and stability. The results show that the highest classification accuracy of 71% could be achieved from an imbalanced training dataset containing only 60% of the original dataset. The results also showed that S2 data could be successfully used to map fruit-tree crops and provide valuable information for subtropical crop management and precision agriculture in heterogeneous horticultural landscapes.","Four subsets of apple (Malus Mill.) germplasm representing modern and old cultivars from the repository and apple genetics population of the Horticulture and Food Research Institute of New Zealand Limited were used in this study. A total of 155 genotypes randomly chosen from the four subsets were analyzed for random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) variation. Nine decamer primers generated a total of 43 fragments, 42 of which were polymorphic across the 155 genotypes. Pairwise distances were calculated between germplasm subsets using the distance metric algorithm in S-PLUS, and used to examine intra-and inter-subset variance components by analysis of molecular variation (AMOVAR). A phenogram based on unweighted pair group method with arithmetic average (UPGMA) cluster analysis was constructed from the pairwise distances and a scatter plot was generated from principal coordinate analysis. The AMOVAR showed that most of the variation in the germplasm (94.6%) was found within subsets, suggesting that there is significant variation among the germplasm. The grouping of genotypes based on the phenogram and scatter plot generally did not reflect the pedigree or provenance of the genotypes. It is possible that more RAPD markers are needed for determining genetic relationships in apple germplasm. Nevertheless, the variation observed in the study suggests that the current practice of sublining populations in the first generation to control inbreeding may not be necessary in subsequent generations. If these results are confirmed by fully informative molecular markers, germplasm managers should reassess the structure of their genetics populations. There may be a need to combine sublines in order to capture the maximum genetic diversity available and to streamline breeding efforts. genetic resources in germplasm collections and successive stages of development in breeding programs. More specifically, knowledge of genetic diversity and relationships among sets of germplasm and the potential merit of the genetic diversity is critical to plant improvement (Lee, 1995). In 1990, the Horticulture and Food Research Institute of New Zealand Limited (HortResearch), established a population improvement program to broaden the genetic base and, at the same time study the genetics of horticulturally important traits in apples. An apple genetics population was developed from imported seed and pollen from apple cultivars and varieties from clonal repositories in major apple producing regions in Europe, North America, Australia, Asia and South Africa (Noiton and Shelbourne, 1992). Seeds of accessions of Malus sieversii (Lebed.) were also obtained from Kazakhstan—the presumed center of origin of the cultivated apples (Hokanson et al., 1997). These seedlings have been planted in research orchards in a recurrent selection breeding strategy and maintained at multiple sites to allow for evaluation of general and regionally important horticultural traits and biotic and abiotic resistances. We as germplasm managers now need to assess the level of diversity within this collection to help make informed decisions on management procedures as well as on the choice of breeding strategies to use in combining horticulturally important traits in our breeding program. Historically, assessments of genetic composition of germplasm collections have been carried out at several levels including inferences based on reproductive biology, ecogeographic data, morphology, pigmentation, ontogeny, social history, pedigree records, breeding behavior, in situ and ex situ evaluation of traits, chromosome structure and behavior, protein markers, and molecular markers such as restricted fragment length polymorReceived for publication 10 July 2000.

The consequences of loss of genetic diversity have been experienced sporadically throughout history, often with significant human and economic costs, which has been a common problem with many of the world’s important food crops (Way et al., 1990). The genus Malus (apples), is characterized by large diversity, but thus far this has not been translated in the cultivated (Malus sylvestris (L) Mill. var. domestica (Borkh.) Mansf.) varieties (Way et al., 1990). Modern commercial apple orchards are dominated by only a few cultivars and many breeding programs utilize only a few well known cultivars in crosses for commercial apple production (Noiton and Shelbourne, 1992; Way et al., 1990). As a result, levels of inbreeding and coancestry in modern apples have been projected to increase (Noiton and Alspach, 1996). Awareness of genetic diversity and management of crop genetic resources have been important components of plant improvement programs. The foundation of crop-based agriculture rests largely on the availability and knowledge of extant plant phisms (RLFPs). The emergence of new polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based molecular markers, such as randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) markers, simple sequence repeats (SSRs), and amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs), has created opportunities to characterize germplasm collections at the molecular level, with markers that are presumably selectively neutral and not affected in their expression by environmental effects. The increased levels of variation detectable with these molecular markers have allowed germplasm managers, plant breeders, and geneticists to pursue with new vigor important questions relating to crops and their genetic resources (Bretting and Widrlechner, 1995). RAPD analyses have various scientific, operational, and budgetary advantages for genome mapping (Welsh and McClelland, 1990, 1991; Williams et al., 1990) and are used with a high degree of success as tools for harnessing genes from germplasm resources in our own apple genome mapping program (Gardiner et al., 1996a, 1999). These same advantages also appear valid for characterization of genetic variation for effective germplasm conservation and use, hence research in population genetics has shown the most growth with respect to the use of RAPD technology (Hedrick, 1992). RAPD markers have been used to create DNA fingerprints for the study of individual identity and taxonomic relationships in both eucaryotic and procaryotic organisms (Caetano-Anolles et al., 1991; Hu and Quiros, 1991; Kresovich et al., 1992); in apples, to differentiate cultivars (Koller et al., 1993), for paternity analysis (Harada et al., 1993), for determining genetic relationships in Malus sylvestris var. domestica cultivars and wild species (Dunemann et al., 1994), along with RFLPs and isozymes for tracing the parentage of ‘Braeburn’ (Gardiner et al., 1996b), and for phylogenetic studies (Zhou and Li, 2000). The following research was conducted to examine the distribution of genetic diversity in the HortResearch apple germplasm collection using RAPD markers. The objectives of the investigation were to 1) assess the level of diversity between and within different subsets of apple germplasm, 2) determine the similarity of the selections/cultivars within the collections and 3) determine if the gene pool of apples had been effectively enlarged with the germplasm obtained from other countries and continents. Materials and Methods PLANT MATERIAL. The HortResearch apple germplasm was divided into four subsets. Subset 1 consisted of old cultivars and breeding lines that are maintained in the repository and the National Cultivar Center (NCC), and subsets 2, 3 and 4 consisted sublines in the apple genetics population. The apple genetics population comprised open-pollinated (op) families as well as families derived from controlled crosses from primitive cultivars, cider apples, and wild species (Noiton et al., 1999), including wild accessions of Malus sieversii (Lebed.) and M. kirghisorum (Al.) Ponom. from Kazakhstan. The families were divided into four sublines and planted at the third leaf stage in randomized incomplete blocks of 20 single tree plots at three different sites over a period of 4 years as follows: 1991: 224 families (10,232 trees); 1992: 149 families (12,800 trees); 72 families (4,862 trees); and 1994: 86 families (3,665 trees). Sublining was used to control inbreeding and maximize, as far as possible, genetic variability and heterozygosity within the population (Noiton and Shelbourne, 1992). We crossed within sublines per generation since inbreeding is unlikely to be a serious problem for many generations. Nevertheless, we had planned to introduce new unrelated material after a few generations to circumvent inbreeding. Ideally, the families should have been grouped into sublines based on region of origin so that individuals from the same region will be confined to one subline. For example, families from countries in Western Europe should be in a different subline than families from countries in North America or Eastern Europe. But this never really happened in our own case, due in part to the fact that seeds were","We utilized remote sensing and ground cover data to predict soil organic carbon (SOC) content across a vast geographic region. Employing a combination of machine learning and deep learning techniques, we developed a novel data fusion approach that integrated Digital Elevation Model (DEM) data, MODIS satellite imagery, WOSIS soil profile data, and CHELSA environmental data. This combined dataset, named GeoBlendMDWC, was specifically designed for SOC prediction. The primary aim of this research is to develop and evaluate a novel optimization algorithm for accurate SOC prediction by leveraging multi-source environmental data. Specifically, this study aims to (1) create an integrated dataset combining remote sensing and ground data for comprehensive SOC analysis, (2) develop a new optimization technique that enhances both machine learning and deep learning model performance, and (3) evaluate the algorithm’s efficiency and accuracy against established optimization methods like Jaya and GridSearchCV. This study focused on India, Australia, and South Africa, countries known for their significant agricultural activities. We introduced a novel optimization technique for both machine learning and deep neural networks, comparing its performance to established methods like the Jaya optimization technique and GridSearchCV. The models evaluated included XGBoost Regression, LightGBM, Gradient Boosting Regression (GBR), Random Forest Regression, Decision Tree Regression, and a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) model. Our research demonstrated that the proposed optimization algorithm consistently outperformed existing methods in terms of execution time and performance. It achieved results comparable to GridSearchCV, reaching an R2 of 90.16, which was a significant improvement over the base XGBoost model’s R2 of 79.08. In deep learning optimization, it significantly outperformed the Jaya algorithm, achieving an R2 of 61.34 compared to Jaya’s 30.04. Moreover, it was 20–30 times faster than GridSearchCV. Given its speed and accuracy, this algorithm can be applied to real-time data processing in remote sensing satellites. This advanced methodology will greatly benefit the agriculture and farming sectors by providing precise SOC predictions.","Crop area extent estimates and crop type maps provide crucial information for agricultural monitoring and management. Remote sensing imagery in general and, more specifically, high temporal and high spatial resolution data as the ones which will be available with upcoming systems, such as Sentinel-2, constitute a major asset for this kind of application. The goal of this paper is to assess to what extent state-of-the-art supervised classification methods can be applied to high resolution multi-temporal optical imagery to produce accurate crop type maps at the global scale. Five concurrent strategies for automatic crop type map production have been selected and benchmarked using SPOT4 (Take5) and Landsat 8 data over 12 test sites spread all over the globe (four in Europe, four in Africa, two in America and two in Asia). This variety of tests sites allows one to draw conclusions applicable to a wide variety of landscapes and crop systems. The results show that a random forest classifier operating on linearly temporally gap-filled images can achieve overall accuracies above 80% for most sites. Only two sites showed low performances: Madagascar due to the presence of fields smaller than the pixel size and Burkina Faso due to a mix of trees and crops in the fields. The approach is based on supervised machine learning techniques, which need in situ data collection for the training step, but the map production is fully automatic.","The efficacy of the Senegal prickly-ash Zanthoxylum zanthoxyloides (Lam.) roots and the African locust bean tree Parkia biglobosa (Jacq.) pod back was study for their efficacy in the control of okra pest, Podagrica spp. The study was carried out in the laboratory and on the field in the farming season of 2018. Z. zanthoxyloides roots were obtained from Jima-Doko forest and P. biglibosa fruit back from Takunpara. Both plant materials were air-dried under shade for 120 hours. Both plant parts were pounded separately in wooden mortar with the aid of wooden pestle until the materials turns to fine particles. Determined weight of 100, 150, 200, 250, and 300 grams were taken for each plant materials and soaked in water for 24 hours and stirred at intervals of an hour. The mixture were then sieved with a muslin cloth and filtered with Whatman filter paper to eliminate all finest particles of varying sizes. These concentrations were applied individually on 10 adults of Podagrica spp. in the laboratory. It was observed that the concentration of 200 – 300g performed better for both plant materials in the control of okra flea beetle. These resulted to the death of above 50% of the insect within 2 hours. These significant laboratory trials were then formulated and taken to the field. Both plant materials acted as anti-feedants and repellants against Podagrica spp. It was also revealed that Z. zanthoxyloides performed significantly (p<0.05) better than the P. biglibosa. Furthermore, short interval applications (<or=3days) of these plant materials could be a good  replacement for synthetic chemicals, hence bio-pesticides that could be adopted for organic agriculture.","South Africa has a long history of recurrent droughts that have adversely affected its economic performance. The recent 2015 drought has been declared the most serious in 26 years and impaired key agricultural sectors including the forestry sector. Research on the forests’ responses to drought is therefore essential for management planning and monitoring. The effects of the latest drought on the forests in South Africa have not been studied and are uncertain. The study reported here addresses this gap by using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)-derived normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and precipitation data retrieved and processed using the JavaScript code editor in the Google Earth Engine (GEE) and the corresponding normalized difference infrared index (NDII), Palmer drought severity index (PDSI), and El Niño time series data for KwaMbonambi, northern Zululand, between 2002 and 2016. The NDVI and NDII time series were decomposed using the Breaks for Additive Seasonal and Trend (BFAST) method to establish the trend and seasonal variation. Multiple linear regression and Mann–Kendall tests were applied to determine the association of the NDVI and NDII with the climate variables. Plantation trees displayed high NDVI values (0.74–0.78) from 2002 to 2013; then, they decreased sharply to 0.64 in 2015. The Mann–Kendall trend test confirmed a negative significant (p = 0.000353) trend between 2014 and 2015. This pattern was associated with a precipitation deficit and low NDII values during a strong El Niño phase. The PDSI (−2.6) values indicated severe drought conditions. The greening decreased in 2015, with some forest remnants showing resistance, implying that the tree species had varying sensitivity to drought. We found that the plantation trees suffered drought stress during 2015, although it seems that the trees began to recover, as the NDVI signals rose in 2016. Overall, these results demonstrated the effective use of the NDVI- and NDII-derived MODIS data coupled with climatic variables to provide insights into the influence of drought on plantation trees in the study area.","Root feeding bark beetles in the genus Hylastes Hylastes breeding in loblolly pine across 3 crown (Coleoptera: Curculionidae: Scolytinae) commoncondition classes (healthy, dying, dead).

However, there is little knowledge about how road and land use affect plant diversity in mountains landscapes, particularly in southern Africa. Previous studies have studied the impact of the road or land use on plant species diversity separately and have concentrated on a single plant species. Here we compare the plant diversity of regenerated trees, shrubs, herbaceous plant, and grasses among Forest, Fallow, Agriculture, and Road in the Moribane Forest Reserve (MFR), in Eastern Chimanimani Mountain landscape in Mozambique. To assess how land-use change affects plant diversity, we conducted 45 transects along the roadside and randomly established 24 quadrats in the Agriculture fields and Fallow and 26 quadrats in the pristine Forest. In each transect and quadrats, we recorded the occurrence of four plant life forms (regenerated trees, shrubs, herbaceous, and grass species) to determine the alpha and beta-diversity across land-uses, and we assessed the invasiveness of each species. Species composition varied significantly among the land-uses types. Roadside had higher species diversity and the highest number of invasive species (138 total species of all plant life forms; 31 invasive species), following Agriculture (72; 30), Fallow (81; 20), and Forest (78; 19). There was no similarity in species between roadsides and other land-uses. Furthermore, roadside recorded the highest average species turnover for all plant life forms following Agriculture, Forest, and Fallow. Among the plants, the most important life form was herbaceous with 143 species, following grass with 86 species, shrubs with 86, and regenerated trees with 65 species. The land-use pattern makes the landscape more diversified in the study area and, as a result, increase the plant species richness and diversity by species replacement. This study is unique in collecting and analyzing data on different plant life forms on roadsides linked with a range of different land-use types within a small region of a mountain landscape in southern Africa.","Agricultural production in northern Benin is characterized by smallholder traditional agroforestry systems, with on-farm remnant tree species. Among its numerous advantages, agroforestry is known for its valuable contribution to biodiversity conservation. This study quantifies the importance of Vitellaria paradoxa C.F. Gaertn agroforests in terms of woody species conservation in Atacora district in Benin. Forest inventories were performed within 50×50 m plots constructed on a net grid map of Atacora district. Diversity indices were computed for both adult and juvenile species in two land management regimes: fields and fallows. Overall 41 woody species were recorded; 28 in fields and 36 in fallows. Taking into account matured and juvenile individuals, the diversity of woody species increased: 86 species in total; 69 species in fields and 78 in fallows. The biodiversity of V. paradoxa’s agroforestry parklands increases from fields to fallows, and decreases from bulk species (considering mature and juvenile species) to adult ones. Leguminosae and Combretaceae were the most abundant families registered. From the Cover Value Index, V. paradoxa, Parkia biglobosa, Lannea microcarpa, Lannea acida and Diospiros mespiliformis were the most abundant species. Support for maintaining this kind of agricultural system is needed, as this exemplifies the synergy for providing, provisioning and supporting services and biodiversity conservation.   Key words: Agroforestry, conservation, ecosystem services, farmland, shea tree.","We test the hypothesis that the tree species previously known as Deinbollia sp. 2. is a new species for science. We formally characterise and name this species as Deinbollia onanae (Sapindaceae-Litchi clade) and we discuss it in the context of the assemblage of montane tree species in the Cameroon Highlands of West-Central Africa. The new species is a shade-bearing, non-pioneer understorey forest tree species reaching 15 m high and a trunk diameter that can attain over 40 cm at 1.3 m above the ground. Seed dispersal has been recorded by chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes ellioti) and by putty-nose monkeys (Cercopithecus nictitans) and the species is used by chimpanzees for nesting. Cameroon has the highest species-diversity and species endemism known in this African-Western Indian Ocean genus of 42, mainly lowland species. Deinbollia onanae is an infrequent tree species known from six locations in surviving islands of montane (sometimes also upper submontane) forest along the line of the Cameroon Highlands, including one at Ngel Nyaki in Mambilla, Nigeria. Deinbollia onanae is here assessed as Endangered according to the IUCN 2012 standard, threatened by severe fragmentation of its mountain forest habitat due to extensive and ongoing clearance for agriculture. The majority of the 28 tree species of montane forest (above 2000 m alt.) in the Cameroon Highlands are also widespread in East African mountains (i.e. are Afromontane wide). Deinbollia onanae is one of only seven species known to be endemic (globally restricted to) these highlands. It is postulated that this new species is morphologically closest to Deinbollia oreophila, a frequent species at a lower (submontane) altitudinal band of the same range. Detailed ecological data on Deinbollia onanae from the Nigerian location, Ngel Nyaki, where it has been known under the name Deinbollia “pinnata”, is reviewed.","Deinbollia onanae (Sapindaceae-Litchi clade) is here formally named and characterised as a new species to science, previously known as Deinbollia sp. 2. Cameroon has the highest species-diversity and species endemism known in this African-Western Indian Ocean genus of 42 species. Deinbollia onanae is an infrequent tree species known from five locations in surviving islands of montane (or upper submontane) forest along the line of the Cameroon Highlands. It is here assessed as Endangered according to the IUCN 2012 standard, threatened mainly by clearance of forest for agriculture. The majority of tree species characteristic of montane forest (above 2000 m alt.) in the Cameroon Highlands are also widespread in East African mountains (i.e. are Afromontane). Deinbollia onanae is one of only a very small number of species that are endemic (globally restricted to) the mountain range. It is postulated that this new species is in a sister relationship with Deinbollia oreophila, which is a frequent species of a lower (submontane) altitudinal band of the same range. It is further postulated that seed dispersal is or was by frugivorous birds, potentially turacos, alternatively by primates such as Preuss s monkey.","The East African coastal forests are subject of haphazard modification following anthropogenic pressures including tree cutting and clearing for agriculture. These activities, which are leading cause of habitat disturbance and species loss, are the major challenge in the management of sensitive wildlife species such as forest understory birds. This study investigated species composition of understory birds in the coastal forests of northeastern Tanzania to generate information for the management of the landscape and biodiversity in the area. Using mist nets, birds were trapped from core and edge habitats of representative forest patches. Trapped birds were classified to species level and categorized into bird guilds based on their levels of forest dependence. It was found out that species richness was influenced by forest patch size rather than level of habitat disturbance. Edge habitat was also found to be important in hosting higher number of forest understory birds, especially generalists—but this should be treated with caution because following habitat destruction that is ongoing in the study area, there is a danger of generalist wiping out specialist species due to competitive exclusion. Strict control measures to stop illegal tree cutting and agricultural activities near the forests were recommended for sustainable conservation of the understory birds in the forests.","Monanthotaxis bali is the only known, solely montane (occurring solely above 2000 m alt.) species of the genus. It joins Monanthotaxis orophila (Rwanda) and M. discolor (Tanzania), two other species that can also occur above 2000 m alt. Monanthotaxis bali is an addition to the small number (28) of the tree species of the surviving montane forests of the Cameroon Highlands of which only eight other species are endemic. Due to its supra-axillary inflorescences, and petals arranged in one whorl but with the outer petals overlapping the inner petals distally, and rounded flower buds, the new species is placed in Hoekstra’s clade B of Monanthotaxis. The new species is unusual in being a treelet in a predominantly lianescent genus, and in lacking the glaucous underside of the leaf-blades that usually characterises the genus. Monanthotaxis bali takes the number of continental African species of the genus to 80, and makes Cameroon, with 30 species, the most species-diverse country for the genus. Monanthotaxis bali is known only from the Bali Ngemba Forest Reserve, a forest remnant under pressure of degradation and clearance in the Bamenda Highlands of Cameroon. It may already be extinct due to logging and agricultural activities. Here it is described, illustrated, mapped and assessed as Critically Endangered (Possibly Extinct) using the IUCN 2012 criteria.","The diversity and structure of plant communities are valuable indicators for assessing landscape quality. Land-use change is one of the main factors considered to affect and have the strongest impacts on biodiversity. In this study, we assessed the effects of the conversion of tropical dry forests and savannahs into agricultural lands on the floral diversity and the structure of the vegetation. For this purpose, we carried out vegetation surveys in 198 plots of 50 m x 50 m. Within each plot, we documented all herbaceous, shrubby, and tree species present. We calculated total, spatial, and local floral diversities by land-use types and characterized the structure of the plant communities. Our results show that the overall floral diversity of the study area remains quite high (483 species of vascular plants from 298 genera and 71 families) and was not strongly impacted by agricultural land use (Pareto inequality index is 23-77). Croplands had the highest spatial (9.4) and local diversities. There was no significant difference between the land-use types in terms of the native species richness while croplands harbored significantly the most alien species. Agricultural land use significantly affected the structure of the plant communities. Trees are very rare in croplands and are frequent in forests and savannahs. The clearing of Guinean dry forests and savannahs for cropping did not automatically lead to a loss of some aspects of ordinary floral diversity. For a better understanding of the effects of land-use change on biodiversity, it would then be more suitable to specify in the studies whether the species concerned are native, alien, generalist, or specialist.","Abstract: Vepris bali is the first known species of Vepris in WC Africa with opposite, trifoliolate leaves and is further unusual for its long petiolules. Known only from Bali Ngemba Forest Reserve, a remnant of submontane forest under great pressure of degradation in the Bamenda Highlands of Cameroon, it may already be extinct due to tree cutting and agricultural incursions.

The generic name ‘Acacia’ comes from the greek word ‘akis’, meaning a barb or a point. The species Acacia nilotica (L.) Willd.ex Del belongs to family Fabaceae and commonly known as kikar or babul. According to Champion and Seth (1968), the species is growing naturally in southern tropical dry deciduous forests and southern tropical thorn forests therefore, the species is considered to be native of Indian Subcontinent, Burma, Sri Lanka, Saudi Arabia, Tropical Africa, Egypt and in West and East Sudan. The largest tracts are found in Sind. It is distributed throughout the greater part of India in forest areas, farmlands, agriculture fields, roadsides, tank foreshores, village grazing lands, bunds, waste lands, along the railway lines and the national highways. Mostly it occurs as an isolated tree and rarely found in patches to a limited extent in forests. It has been widely planted on farms throughout the plains of the Indian subcontinent.","Structural changes in secondary forests are less known in West Africa, and this precludes their management. This study aims at providing quantitative information on floristic composition and structure of the Lama secondary forests (Benin), so as to contribute to their restoration, and fill part of knowledge gaps on West African secondary forests. Data of 77 permanent plots each of 0.5 ha were used to analyze the floristic composition, the trajectory of the recovery and the recovery of stocking in these forests, compared to nearby old-growth forests. The results showed that the forests were less diversified with few species very common in the forest stands; the most dominant were Lonchocarpus sericeus and Anogeissus leiocarpa in the secondary forests, and Dialium guineense , Diospyros mespiliformis and Afzelia africana in the old-growth forests. The secondary forests hold more species than the mature ones. Their compositions will recover that of the original forest because species of the original forest were actively regenerating in the secondary forests. About 28 years after recovery, large trees were insufficient and basal area was about 60% of those of the mature forests. Further studies are needed to elucidate barriers to tree regeneration and dynamics of tree population. © 2016 International Formulae Group. All rights reserved.

Land is a principal factor of production, a source of life and livelihoods. It provides a means of living and a variety of uses such as agricultural, human settlement, environmental conservation, urban and industrial development purposes among others. These uses compete for space in a fixed area, hence the rising land use conflicts and degradation. The situation has threatened lives and livelihoods, making it difficult to plan for the livelihood activities in the County. This is happening against the backdrop of land use policy changes including; sessional paper no 3 of 2009 on the National Land Policy, the Constitution of Kenya 2010, the Land Act, 2012, the Land Registration Act, 2012, the Community Land Act, 2016 and sessional paper no 1 of 2017 on National Land Use Policy that were intended to alleviate the situation. This situation is now a major threat to the livelihood of the local communities in Baringo County. This study, therefore, sought to examined the dynamics of land use changes on the livelihood of the local communities in Baringo county with specific objective to establish the drivers of the changes. A comprehensive desk review of existing literature was done, and land use changes were descriptively analyzed. The review spanned from pre-colonial (before 1895), colonial (1895 to 1963), independence (1963 to 2010) including the subsequent years of land reforms following the promulgation of the Constitution of Kenya 2010 onwards to 2020. The study found that the key drivers of land use changes originate from the change of land use policies from customary to European-like systems during the colonial era (1895 to 1963). These drivers revolve around the conflicts in the application of land use policies and laws, dual production system (different land use for registered private land in arable areas and the unregistered community land in non-arable areas within the county) occasioning wide productivity gap and economic disparity. Further the knowledge gaps associated with colonial perceptions, ideologies, and attitudinal International Journal of Academic Research in Business and Social Sciences Vol. 1 1 , No. 9, 2021, E-ISSN: 2222-6990 © 2021 HRMARS 562 practices, which led to misconception and wrong policies aggravated the situation. The consequences disorganize the local community land use and social system, broke down the traditional grazing and cropping patterns, depleted soils fertility & degraded the environment. In addition, the study found out that in the unregistered community land, land use conflicts were rampant, and characterized by invaded and claim interest as well as unscrupulous legal manipulation of land ownership records leading to dispossession. These two salient features are the main drivers of land use changes that led to continuous and frequent fatal inter-ethnic land use conflicts among the local communities; causing displacement and destruction of property among other atrocities working against politically weak local community. This scenario destabilized livelihood possibilities making it difficult for local communities to engage in basic livelihood activities and create uncertainty for future development. The study concluded that the security of land tenure perpetrates land use conflicts particularly in the unregistered community land. The government, therefore, need to register the community land to enhance land tenure security in the county. Background of the Study The background of the study covers introduction, problem statement, objectives Introduction Globally, land resource is the basis of human livelihood, since it provides basic needs such as food, water, energy, clothing and shelter. It allows for a variety of uses including agricultural production, human settlement and environmental conservation to preserve it for posterity, and can satisfy a diverse range of local communities’ livelihood objectives. All these uses of land resource compete for space in a fixed land area within an ever-changing environment. In addition, it is a finite resource and increasingly becoming scarce over time. The ensuing competition and growing forces at work necessitates government intervention through land use policy in order to harmonize the various uses. Moreover, in practice, it is difficult to arrive to an equilibrium between the various uses without an external force. Therefore, the unfolding scenario leads to land use changes problems, which calls for government intervention through land use policies. Land use policy is intended to balance users demands, facilitate production and sustain livelihood for the local communities and at same time guarantee political stability. In this study, dynamics of land use changes is defined as policy changes and the resultant consequences. In Africa, dynamics of land use changes evolved through various transformations associated with government policies adopted by different political regimes. The changes were traced from the precolonial, colonial and post-colonial eras. Each of these eras introduced changes in land use policies that shape up different social, economic and political realities on the livelihood of the local communities. Livelihood is defined as comprising the capabilities, assets (including both material and social resources) and activities required for a means of living by the local communities (Scones, 2008). Livelihood is sustainable when it can cope with the policy changes, and recover from, stresses and shocks arising from it, maintain or enhance local communities’ capabilities, assets and activities, while not undermining the natural resources base. In this case, land resource represents the natural resource base, and the capacity of the local communities to use it to generate and maintain their means of living, enhance their well-being and preserve it for future generations is dependent on policy changes. These changes influence greatly the livelihood outcomes of the local communities. International Journal of Academic Research in Business and Social Sciences Vol. 1 1 , No. 9, 2021, E-ISSN: 2222-6990 © 2021 HRMARS 563 In this respect, local communities are indigenous populations who reside and derive their livelihood from land resource. They consider land resource as the principal factor of production and the source of livelihood because it provides basic needs such as food, water, energy, clothing and shelter. Land resource also allows for a variety of uses including agricultural, human settlement and environmental conservation that satisfy a diverse range of livelihood objectives for local communities. In Kenya, dynamics of land use changes emanates largely from colonial regime actions and policies, which continued in slightly modified manner after independence (Thuo, 2013). Before the colonial era (before 1895), land use was managed through African local communities’ customary laws. Land use and management practices were guided and controlled by established regulations and procedures among various local communities (Thuo, 2013). Land use was organized into specific areas of agricultural (crops and livestock), human settlement, environmental conservation uses and heritage sites, among others. Most of the land resource was owned by the entire community while individual community members had only user rights (Thuo, 2013). The land use was communal, small-scale subsistence in nature, stable and sustainable in terms of provision for local communities’ livelihood and environmental conservation needs. The period depicts a close economy without government intervention in terms of land use policy changes. Local communities enjoy territorial niches with boundaries defined by specific geographical and physical features such as rivers, mountains, trees, and valleys. The ethnic community chiefs, assisted by the Council of elders, had the power to make land use decisions. Land use was assumed to operate in a dynamic equilibrium checked by raids and natural disasters such as war, disease outbreaks, earthquakes and famines. Soil fertility was maintained through shift cultivation with adequate fallow periods of three (3) years or more required to restore soil structure and fertility. Much of the uncultivated land was used as pastoral communities grazing areas. Forested areas were used for hunting, trapping and honey gathering. Periodic droughts checked Land use and inter communities’ raids to maintain the dynamic equilibrium. During colonial era(1895 to 1963), the colonial government took over the control of land use from the local communities through violence, trickery, and mutual agreements (Thuo, 2013). It dismantled the ethnic community territorial niches and nationalized land use. All land in Kenya became Crown Land. All local communities were dispossessed, and customary land use laws by the local communities were rendered redundant. All existing land use rights by the local communities were at the mercy of the colonial power (Okoth-Ogendo, 1995). Therefore, the genesis of land use problems in Kenya. Fundamentally, the land use policy changes were biased and oriented to benefit European settlers with scant attention to local communities. The land use policies created a dual land use system where the European colonists occupy the high rainfall and fertile areas, employing modern land use practices based on individuals’ decisions. At the same time, the local communities were restricted to native reserves in the drier regions, where local communities were allowed to continue with collective land use decisions. These land use changes promoted economic disparity between European settler and local communities during colonial era. Land use policies promoted high productivity land use practices for European white farmers, while encouraging low productivity traditional land use practices for local communities. The land use policy c","Land use change is known to affect suspended sediment fluxes in headwater catchments. There is however limited empirical evidence of the magnitude of these effects for montane catchments in East Africa. We collected a unique 4‐year high‐frequency data set and assessed seasonal sediment variation, water pathways, and sediment response to hydrology in three catchments under contrasting land use in the Mau Forest Complex, Kenya's largest tropical montane forest. Annual suspended sediment yield was significantly higher in a smallholder agriculture‐dominated catchment (131.5 ± 90.6 t km−2 yr−1) than in a tea‐tree plantation catchment (42.0 ± 21.0 t km−2 yr−1) and a natural forest catchment (21.5 ± 11.1 t km−2 yr−1) (p < 0.05). Transfer function models showed that in the natural forest and the tea‐tree plantations subsurface flow pathways delivered water to the stream, while in the smallholder agriculture shallow subsurface and surface runoff were dominant. There was a delayed sediment response to rainfall for the smallholder agriculture and the tea‐tree plantations. A slow depletion in sediment supply suggests that the wider catchment area supplies sediment, especially in the catchment dominated by smallholder farming. In contrast, a fast sediment response and depletion in sediment supply in the natural forest suggests a dominance of temporarily stored and nearby sediment sources. This study shows that the vegetation cover of a forest ecosystem is very effective in conserving soil, whereas catchments with more bare soil and poor soil conservation practices generated six times more suspended sediment yield. Catchment connectivity through unpaved tracks is thought to be the main explanation for the difference in sediment yield.","Abstract. Conversion of natural forest (NF) to other land uses could lead to significant changes in catchment hydrology, but the nature of these changes has been insufficiently investigated in tropical montane catchments, especially in Africa. To address this knowledge gap, we aimed to identify stream water (RV) sources and flow paths in three tropical montane sub-catchments (27–36 km2) with different land use (natural forest, NF; smallholder agriculture, SHA; and commercial tea and tree plantations, TTP) within a 1021 km2 catchment in the Mau Forest complex, Kenya. Weekly samples were collected from stream water, precipitation (PC) and mobile soil water for 75 weeks and analysed for stable isotopes of water (δ2H and δ18O) for mean transit time (MTT) estimation with two lumped parameter models (gamma model, GM; and exponential piston flow model, EPM) and for the calculation of the young water fraction. Weekly samples from stream water and potential endmembers were collected over a period of 55 weeks and analysed for Li, Na, Mg, K, Rb, Sr and Ba for endmember mixing analysis (EMMA). Solute concentrations in precipitation were lower than in stream water in all catchments (p < 0.05), whereas concentrations in springs, shallow wells and wetlands were generally more similar to stream water. The stream water isotope signal was considerably damped compared to the isotope signal in precipitation. Mean transit time analysis suggested long transit times for stream water (up to 4 years) in the three sub-catchments, but model efficiencies were very low. The young water fraction ranged from 13 % in the smallholder agriculture sub-catchment to 15 % in the tea plantation sub-catchment. Mean transit times of mobile soil water ranged from 3.2–3.3 weeks in forest soils and 4.5–7.9 weeks in pasture soils at 15 cm depth to 10.4–10.8 weeks in pasture soils at 50 cm depth. The contribution of springs and wetlands to stream discharge increased from a median of 16.5 (95 % confidence interval: 11.3–22.9), 2.1 (−3.0–24.2) and 50.2 (30.5–65.5) % during low flow to 20.7 (15.2–34.7), 53.0 (23.0–91.3) and 69.4 (43.0–123.9) % during high flow in the natural forest, smallholder agriculture and tea plantation sub-catchments, respectively. Our results indicate that groundwater is an important component of stream water, irrespective of land use. The results further suggest that the selected transit time models and tracers might not be appropriate in tropical catchments with highly damped stream water isotope signatures. A more in-depth investigation of the discharge dependence of the young water fraction and transit time estimation using other tracers, such as tritium, could therefore shed more light on potential land use effects on the hydrological behaviour of tropical montane catchments.","Abstract. Agricultural catchments in the tropics often generate high concentrations of suspended sediments following the conversion of natural ecosystems. The eroded fine particles are generally enriched with carbon (TC) and nutrients (TN and TP) originating from the topsoil of agricultural land. Sediment-associated TC, TN and TP are an important loss to the terrestrial ecosystem and tightly connected to an increase in riverine particulate TC and nutrient export. Soil nutrient depletion can limit crop growth and yields, whereas an excess of nutrients in streams can cause eutrophication in freshwater systems. Streams in East Africa, with widespread land conversion from forests to agriculture, are expected to receive high loads of sediment-associated TC, TN and TP. In this study, we assess the effect of land use on particulate TC, TN and TP concentrations. Suspended sediments (time-integrated, manual-event-based and automatic-event-based sediment samples) were analysed for TC, TN and TP concentrations collected at the outlet of a natural montane forest (35.9), a tea-tree plantation (33.3) and a smallholder agriculture (27.2 km2) catchment in western Kenya during a wet sampling period in 2018 and a drier sampling period in 2019. Particulate TC, TN and TP concentrations were up to 3-fold higher (p<0.05) in the natural forest catchment compared to fertilized agricultural catchments. However, because of higher sediment loads from the smallholder agriculture catchment, the total sediment-associated loads of TC, TN and TP were higher compared to the natural forest and tea-tree plantation catchment. The higher C:N ratios in the natural forest suggest that the particulate nutrients are of organic origin due to tighter nutrient cycles, whereas lower ratios in both agricultural catchments suggest a mixture of mineral and organic sediment sources. The findings of this study imply that with the loss of natural forest, the inherent soil fertility is progressively lost under the current low fertilization rates and soil management strategies.","The paper aims at interpreting inter-linkages between environmental changes and rural out-migration and at assessing their impacts on quality of life of rural women with a case illustration of Upper Kosi Catchment, Uttarakhand Himalayas, India. The results indicate that the availability of water, fuel-wood and fodder decreased, agricultural production declined and livelihood opportunities were reduced mainly due to depletion of natural resources. Consequently, the male out-migration increased by 15% during 1981–2011. This increased workload of women by 25%, more than 40% women are under severe threat of a variety of health risks generated mainly due to excess work-load, under-nourishment and lack of hygiene and sanitation.

Joshi members of the family (Maithani 1996). On the other hand, there is severe shortage of adult male labour to work in agriculture and other sectors of rural economy which further acts as a drag on agricultural productivity and retards the process of socio-economic development in the mountains. The cumulative impact of all these physical, socio-economic and cultural constraints in the mountains is leading to grinding poverty, hardship, constant fear of insecurity, a feeling of helplessness, and complete dependence on the outside help. The environment thus created is not conducive to attaining the goals of sustainable mountain development (Maithani 1996; Joshi and Tiwari 2013). During the recent past a variety of changes has emerged in traditional resource utilization pattern mainly in response to the population growth and resultant increased demand of natural resources, and to the global change, particularly economic globalisation, urbanization and climate change in the Himalayas (IOM 2008; Jain and Nagarwalla 2004; Tiwari and Joshi 2012a). Women experience these changes differently and disproportionately and respond to them in a varying manner because of socially constructed gender relations and environmental sensitivity of mountain ecosystems. They make use of their critical traditional knowledge of and experience with natural resource management and adapting agricultural and food systems to multiple drivers of environmental change, including climate change, globalisation and economic processes, out-migration, and land-use changes in mountain environments, which helped women to become an important agent of sustainable mountain development (ICIMOD 2011). However, these changes have exerted sharply accentuated pressures on local economy through depletion of land, water, biodiversity and forests resources, collapsing conventional production system and increasing community vulnerability to livelihood and food insecurity and increased risks of natural disasters (World Bank 2009; Lonergan 1998). This has augmented male out-migration, and consequently increased hardships of rural women and deteriorated their quality of life (Mamgain 2003; Tiwari and Joshi 2012b). Conceptual Background Mountains have long been marginalized from the view point of sustainable development of their resources and inhabitants. However, during the recent years our understanding about the problems of mountain regions and approach to their development has undergone drastic changes (ICIMOD 2010). This is reflected by a deepening anxiety over the depletion of natural resources and disruption of mountain ecosystem services. As a result, the significance of mountain social-ecological systems was acknowledged for the first time on a global scale in Agenda 21 of the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED), held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in 1992 (UN 2012). Mountains include some of the most fragile ecosystems on the planet (ICIMOD 2010) as they are highly sensitive to changes caused by natural as well as anthropogenic factors (Sonesson and Messerli 2002). The drivers of changes range from a variety on natural hazards and disasters to a series of human-induced processes such as population growth, depletion of natural resources, urbanization, economic globalisation and resultant intensification of land use (Tiwari 2000; ICIMOD 2011). Moreover, changing climatic conditions have put pressure on the mountain environments through higher mean annual temperatures and melting of glaciers and snow, altered precipitation patterns, and more frequent and extreme weather events 79 Environmental Changes, Rural Out-migration and Social Dynamics in Himalayas which are likely to intensify the impacts of other natural as well as socio-economic drivers of change (IPCC 2007; UNEP-WCMC 2002; CIDA 2002; Brody et al. 2008; Daley 2011). Subsistence agriculture, livestock raising and income generation through small scale trade, and wage and casual labour constitute the main source of livelihood of mountain communities (Leduc and Shrestha 2008). The Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) of the United Nations has identified more than 75% of the land surface of the world’s mountain as unsuitable or marginally suitable for agriculture (Huddleston and Ataman 2003; Messerli and Ives 1997; IFAD 2001). It has been observed that the proportion of poor and vulnerable people increases with elevation (Huddleston and Ataman 2003). There are indications that poverty inequality between mountain people and those living in other areas is currently increasing (ICIMOD 2010). Approximately, 271 million people, which accounts for nearly 40% of the mountain population in developing and transition countries, have been estimated to be highly vulnerable to food insecurity, specifically in Asia and Latin America (Huddleston and Ataman 2003; FAO 2008). High dependency on natural resources and increasing marginalisation are some of important factors for prevailing poverty, food and livelihood insecurity and poor community health, in mountains of developing countries which are further increasing their vulnerability to long-term impacts of global environmental changes (Huddleston and Ataman 2003). The globalizing economy has both positive as well as negative impacts on the mountain livelihoods and economy. The fast growing tourism industry in India, China and Nepal has opened new opportunities for the growth of mountain economy. Furthermore, China and India are the fastest growing economies in Asia, yet, they have the highest poverty ratios. Moreover, the economic globalisation have further increased the vulnerability of the mountain communities to the environmental risks through exploitation of natural resources even in remote and inaccessible areas, particularly in the developing countries. This seems to have further deepened poverty imbalances between highlands and lowlands (Hassan et al. 2005; Huddleston and Ataman 2003). However, for millennia the mountain communities were developing distinctive mechanisms to adapt to these typical conditions through evolving a range of adaptive measures (UNEP 2004; ICIMOD 2010). Migration of male youth is one the important adaptive measures to constraints of subsistence economy and changing environmental conditions and associated natural and socio-economic risks across all the mountain regions of the world (Sherpa 2007). On one hand, labour migration improves economic conditions and ensures food security in terms of remittance (Kollmair et al. 2006); on the other hand, it has inadvertently created a vacuum in the mountain societies, putting extra responsibilities on women (Sherpa 2007). During 1991–2000, the level of adult male out-migration in the mountainous regions of South Asia exceeded 40% (Rasmussen and Parvez 2002). Draining away of productive human resource from mountains has serious implications not only for the economic development, but also for the enrichment of socio-cultural life in the region (Maithani 1996). Women, being natural resource developers, possess undocumented indigenous knowledge, and their contribution towards preserving the mountain cultures and natural resources is highly significant (ICIMOD 1999). However, the depletion of natural resource base has affected women adversely by increasing their workload and marginality (UNDP 2010). As a result, women play crucial role in mountain societies as major work force in food production system and as key players in the conservation and management of natural re80 P. C. Tiwari • B. Joshi sources and environments (FAO 2010, 2011). Globally, women share is nearly 43% of the work force in agricultural sector, and mountain regions of Asia, Africa, and Latin America it is above 50% (Sherpa 2007). The combined hardship and adversity of mountain living conditions trained the women to respond radically to the forces that were exploiting their natural resources and undermining their livelihoods. Rural women’s active participation in the conservation and management of their natural resources laid the foundation for the well known environmental movements in the seventies (Verma 2001). The famous 'Chipko Movement' (hugging the trees movement) of Uttarakhand – a distinctly non-violent grassroots movement – was organized and lead by illiterate rural women against the exploitative state forestry policy in 1970s. However, women in the Himalayas are particularly vulnerable to the impacts of environmental changes due to skewed power relations and inequitable cultural and social norms, as a result, they are often disadvantaged in terms of power relations and accessing resources, and exposed to increased risks associated with environmental changes (ICIMOD 2010). These risks include further marginalization, exclusion from decision-making and dislocation from access to resources for survival. Women generally have far less access to and control over the resources they manage and conserve (Sherpa 2007).

Cultural eutrophication of coastal aquatic systems is a major undesired phenomenon of today, which is mainly ascribed to the application of inorganic fertilizers in agriculture. Consequently, dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) is considered the major problem and widely studied. However, human interventions also strongly influence the riverine dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) concentrations and fluxes. Studies of nutrient inputs from tropical river catchments are biased towards DIN, even though they account for only a portion of the total dissolved nitrogen (TDN) pool, whereas the rest is comprised of DON and has been largely ignored. The tropical Pamba River was studied because of its manifold human activities in the catchment and was sampled during the south west monsoon (SWM), north east monsoon (NEM) and the pre monsoon (PM) months during 2010 to 2013. The largest pilgrim center on earth, the Sabarimala temple, located in the upstream forest is a unique feature of the catchment. Fertilizer application, livestock farming and inadequate sewage treatment are the prevailing land use practices. The goals of this study were to (i) define cause-effect relationships by assessing the effect of various human interventions such as the pilgrims, agriculture and sewage disposal in combination with the seasonal variations in hydrology on the DON concentrations and fluxes and to (ii) quantify the inputs from respective land use segments. The global maximum DON concentration (29 302 μM) was measured for the Pamba River. Pilgrim activities, high population density, agricultural and livestock farming as well as the lack of infrastructure for sanitation facilities were the cause for extremely high DON concentrations and fluxes in the plantation and settlement with mixed tree crop (SMT) segments. A DON yield of 745 kg ha−1 yr−1 was calculated for the Pamba catchment. The total DON inputs from all quantifiable sources amounted to 514 kg ha−1 yr−1 comprising of 69% of the total Pamba DON yield. In the Pamba River, sewage is the major source of DON and the unique Sabarimala pilgrim event accounts for most of it. Nevertheless, sewage input from the rest of the densely-populated catchment is high, which is a common feature of developing countries that lack adequate sanitation and water technology, i.e. in South and Southeast Asia and tropical Africa. Our study shows that DON makes up a significant portion of anthropogenic nitrogen in rivers, in particular in those regions, which are, however, scarce in respective data. It underscores the need for more quantitative studies from densely-populated tropical river catchments in order to improve global nitrogen budgets and the assessment of the consequences of anthropogenic nitrogen inputs into coastal aquatic systems.","A relação entre água, energia e alimento é um tema que tem recebido atenção no meio acadêmico. Diante da escassez dos recursos naturais, da degradação que tem ocorrido não somente no Brasil, mas no mundo todo, os recursos naturais têm sérios riscos de esgotarem. E há que se pensar em uma gestão que possibilite a recuperação do meio ambiente de forma eficiente e sustentável. Compreendendo que o debate de nexo envolve um conjunto de inter-relações entre os recursos naturais utilizados como insumo para os serviços básicos da vida humana, neste sentido, a presente pesquisa objetivou analisar se há possibilidade de integrar a floresta ao nexo água-energia-alimentos, com vistas a não comprometer as demandas futuras e como isso pode contribuir para alcançar os Objetivos de Desenvolvimento Sustentável (ODS). Os objetivos específicos são identificar a interligação entre água, energia, alimento e floresta; apontar a necessidade de integrar a floresta ao nexo tradicional visando alcançar um desenvolvimento mais sustentável e controlar, prevenir as consequências dos impactos ambientais. A metodologia da revisão literária ocorreu com o levantamento por termos previamente identificados nas bases de dados Scopus, Web of Science e Periódico Capes, sendo a pesquisa classificada com abordagem qualitativa e método dedutivo. Os resultados apontaram que a floresta possui relação direta com os elementos água-energia-alimentos, sendo possível contribuir com as seguranças hídrica, energética e alimentar. Concluiu-se que vincular as florestas ao nexo existente, proporcionará uma maior preocupação para garantir a sustentabilidade e o equilíbrio ambiental.   Referências ALROY, John.

Relação entre a disponibilidade hídri","The Maasai Mara and the wider Mau River Basin in East Africa provide fundamental ecosystem services that support people, wildlife, livestock and agriculture. The historical indigenous land use of the Mara and wider Mau basin was wildlife conservation and pastoralism with highland agriculture. However, land policy changes, the rise of community conservancies and the increase in human populations have mediated unprecedented land use shifts over time. We analyze land use and land cover change (LULCC) trends from 1990 to 2040 in the Mara and the wider Mau River Basin landscape. The study examines land use and land cover change trends, establishes factors driving the trends, and assesses the implications of these trends on biodiversity. Multi-temporal satellite images, together with physical and social economic data, were collated to generate future scenarios for transitions for forest, shrubland, grassland, cropland, wetlands and built-up areas between 1990 and 2040. Agricultural expansion is the chief driver of LULCC in the Mara and the wider Mau River Basin, particularly since 2015. There was insignificant change to the forest cover after 2015, which was in part due to government intervention on forest encroachment and boundaries. The anthropogenic choice of tilling the land in the basin caused a decline in grasslands, forests and expanded shrublands, particularly where there was clear tree cutting in the Mau forest. Land use and land cover trends have generated undesirable impacts on ecosystem services that support wildlife conservation.","This study evaluates relationships between contrasting land uses representing an anthropogenic impact gradient in a coastal agricultural catchment, and riparian vegetation, as reflected in changes in nutrient dynamics and water quality. The objectives were to: 1) determine the water and sediment quality emanating from variations in land cover using runoff plots and 2) examine the influence and effectiveness of the riparian vegetation in mediating nutrient fluxes from adjacent pastures. The contrasting land covers generated different runoff volumes, nutrient concentrations and associated loads. The indigenous forest demonstrated the lowest runoff volumes, the highest TN concentrations, but the lowest cumulative TN loads over the study period. Agriculture and alien Acacia mearnsii trees had the greatest impact on nutrient loads. The highest nutrient loads were recorded from the pastures (TN: 84.8 g m−2; NH4 +-N: 38.3 g m−2) and the alien invaded degraded riparian zone (TN: 100.7 g m−2; NH4 +-N: 55.6 g m−2). The nutrient loading was dependent on land cover, land use, rainfall amount and intensity and the associated surface runoff and a decreasing trend in nutrient concentrations was observed from the pastures to the riparian zones and to the river at all sites.","Abstract. This paper summarizes currently available data on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from African natural ecosystems and agricultural lands. The available data are used to synthesize current understanding of the drivers of change in GHG emissions, outline the knowledge gaps, and suggest future directions and strategies for GHG emission research. GHG emission data were collected from 75 studies conducted in 22 countries (n =  244) in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions were by far the largest contributor to GHG emissions and global warming potential (GWP) in SSA natural terrestrial systems. CO2 emissions ranged from 3.3 to 57.0 Mg CO2 ha−1 yr−1, methane (CH4) emissions ranged from −4.8 to 3.5 kg ha−1 yr−1 (−0.16 to 0.12 Mg CO2 equivalent (eq.) ha−1 yr−1), and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions ranged from −0.1 to 13.7 kg ha−1 yr−1 (−0.03 to 4.1 Mg CO2 eq. ha−1 yr−1). Soil physical and chemical properties, rewetting, vegetation type, forest management, and land-use changes were all found to be important factors affecting soil GHG emissions from natural terrestrial systems. In aquatic systems, CO2 was the largest contributor to total GHG emissions, ranging from 5.7 to 232.0 Mg CO2 ha−1 yr−1, followed by −26.3 to 2741.9 kg CH4 ha−1 yr−1 (−0.89 to 93.2 Mg CO2 eq. ha−1 yr−1) and 0.2 to 3.5 kg N2O ha−1 yr−1 (0.06 to 1.0 Mg CO2 eq. ha−1 yr−1). Rates of all GHG emissions from aquatic systems were affected by type, location, hydrological characteristics, and water quality. In croplands, soil GHG emissions were also dominated by CO2, ranging from 1.7 to 141.2 Mg CO2 ha−1 yr−1, with −1.3 to 66.7 kg CH4 ha−1 yr−1 (−0.04 to 2.3 Mg CO2 eq. ha−1 yr−1) and 0.05 to 112.0 kg N2O ha−1 yr−1 (0.015 to 33.4 Mg CO2 eq. ha−1 yr−1). N2O emission factors (EFs) ranged from 0.01 to 4.1 %. Incorporation of crop residues or manure with inorganic fertilizers invariably resulted in significant changes in GHG emissions, but results were inconsistent as the magnitude and direction of changes were differed by gas. Soil GHG emissions from vegetable gardens ranged from 73.3 to 132.0 Mg CO2 ha−1 yr−1 and 53.4 to 177.6 kg N2O ha−1 yr−1 (15.9 to 52.9 Mg CO2 eq. ha−1 yr−1) and N2O EFs ranged from 3 to 4 %. Soil CO2 and N2O emissions from agroforestry were 38.6 Mg CO2 ha−1 yr−1 and 0.2 to 26.7 kg N2O ha−1 yr−1 (0.06 to 8.0 Mg CO2 eq. ha−1 yr−1), respectively. Improving fallow with nitrogen (N)-fixing trees led to increased CO2 and N2O emissions compared to conventional croplands. The type and quality of plant residue in the fallow is an important control on how CO2 and N2O emissions are affected. Throughout agricultural lands, N2O emissions slowly increased with N inputs below 150 kg N ha−1 yr−1 and increased exponentially with N application rates up to 300 kg N ha−1 yr−1. The lowest yield-scaled N2O emissions were reported with N application rates ranging between 100 and 150 kg N ha−1. Overall, total CO2 eq. emissions from SSA natural ecosystems and agricultural lands were 56.9 ± 12.7  ×  109 Mg CO2 eq. yr−1 with natural ecosystems and agricultural lands contributing 76.3 and 23.7 %, respectively. Additional GHG emission measurements are urgently required to reduce uncertainty on annual GHG emissions from the different land uses and identify major control factors and mitigation options for low-emission development. A common strategy for addressing this data gap may include identifying priorities for data acquisition, utilizing appropriate technologies, and involving international networks and collaboration.",15.5782708223197,4,Unlabeled

Decision-makers need to know which of the remaining forests to prioritize for conservation, but the only spatial information on forest biodiversity has, until recently, come from a sparse network of ground-based plots. Here we explore whether airborne hyperspectral imagery can be used to predict the alpha diversity of upper canopy trees in a West African forest. The abundance of tree species were collected from 64 plots (each 1250 m 2 in size) within a Sierra Leonean national park, and Shannon-Wiener biodiversity indices were calculated. An airborne spectrometer measured reflectances of 186 bands in the visible and near-infrared spectral range at 1 m 2 resolution. The standard deviations of these reflectance values and their first-order derivatives were calculated for each plot from the c. 1250 pixels of hyperspectral information within them. Shannon-Wiener indices were then predicted from these plot-based reflectance statistics using a machine-learning algorithm (Random Forest). The regression model fitted the data well (pseudo-R 2 = 84.9%), and we show that standard deviations of green-band reflectances and infra-red region derivatives had the strongest explanatory powers. Our work shows that airborne hyperspectral sensing can be very effective at mapping canopy tree diversity, because its high spatial resolution allows within-plot heterogeneity in reflectance to be characterized, making it an effective tool for monitoring forest biodiversity over large geographic scales.

To answer this question in the Democratic Republic of Congo, the Makala project mapped the tree and forest resources of Kinshasa's wood-fuel supply basin and attempted to predict how they would evolve in the future. Maps were made for four periods (1984, 2001, 2006 and 2012) using a mosaic of four LANDSAT images. The above-ground biomass was estimated in 2012 using forest inventories in 317 plots distributed across the four types of plant cover found on the Bateke plateau (4,337 trees and 44 species were recorded). This inventory data combined with the satellite data allowed us to make the first comprehensive assessment of above-ground biomass in the study area. Between 2000 and 2012, the average volume of wood-fuel fell by more than 50%. Over the entire period studied (1984 to 2012), carbon stocks fell by 75%. In the wood-fuel supply area for Kinshasa, the drastic loss of forest cover, shortened fallow periods, savannah encroachment and the decline of biomass and carbon stocks are clear signals of degradation. However, these initial estimations were derived from a small sample that was extrapolated to the entire supply area. It would be very useful to increase sampling in order to obtain more accurate and realistic figures. The experience of the Makala project clearly shows that the analysis of land cover change helps to understand and document the spatial organization and mechanisms of forest degradation. However, only with a sound wood-fuel resource policy and sustainable community land management, combined with very dynamic tree reintroduction on agricultural land, will it be possible to initiate a sustainable process of restoration. (Resume d'auteur)","Spatial time-series measurements of forest degradation rates are important for estimating national greenhouse gas emissions but have been challenging for open forests and woodlands. This lack of quantitative data on forest degradation rates, location and biomass is an important constraint to developing national REDD+ policy. In Malawi, and in most countries in Africa, most assessments of forest cover change for carbon emissions monitoring tend to report only deforestation in the public forest estate managed by the government, even when important forest degradation also occurs in agricultural areas, such as customary forests and other tree-based systems. This study has resulted in: (a) a new robust forest map for Malawi, (b) spatial and quantitative measurements of both forest degradation and deforestation, and (c) a demonstration of the approach through the introduction of a tool that maps across the broad landscape of forests and trees outside of forests. The results can be used to support REDD+ National Forest Monitoring Systems. This analysis produces new estimates of landscape-wide deforestation rates between 2000–2009 (22,410 ha yr−1) and 2009–2015 (38,937 ha yr−1). We further produce new estimates of the rate of forest degradation between 2000–2009 (42,961 ha yr−1) and 2009–2015 (71,878 ha yr−1). The contribution of these new tools and estimates to capacities for calculating carbon emissions are important, increasing prospects for full REDD+ readiness across semi-arid Africa.","Tropical forests are major repositories of biodiversity, but are fast disappearing as land is converted to agriculture.

However, in recent decades they have been affected by climate variability, which has led to a significant reduction in the populations of dominant species such as shea and African locust within them. The objective of this study is therefore to determine the adaptation strategies developed by managers, as well as the factors influencing these strategies to cope with the changing environment. The methodology deployed for this purpose consists of primary and secondary data collection. Descriptive statistics and binary logistic regression were used to analyse the collected data. The study revealed that more than 70% of the tree managers are men and the majority of them are illiterate, with households of 5-15 children. In addition, more than 80% of the managers have agriculture as their main activity, and the size of their holdings is between 1ha and 10ha. Three strategies are used by tree managers in agricultural fields. The proactive strategy aims to anticipate the consequences of climate variability. The reactive strategy aims to react to the effects of climate variability. The strategy of silvicultural techniques consists of pruning, grafting and assisting the trees. However, the choice of strategies is influenced by the socio-economic characteristics of the respondents. For example, the proactive strategy is influenced by education level, household size and income from non-timber forest products. For the reactive strategy, the size of the holding and the level of education have an effect on the choice of strategy. For the silvicultural techniques strategy, age and education level have an impact on the choice of strategy. It is then up to the relevant authorities to work in the light of these results to initiate actions to strengthen the coping strategies of the people managing the trees in the agricultural fields.","To contribute to the development of meth- ods for the sustainable management of forest ecosystems in Central Africa, the fol- lowing research question was addressed: can analyses of land cover change help to understand and document the spatial or- ganization and mechanisms of forest degra- dation? To answer this question in the Demo- cratic Republic of Congo, the Makala project mapped the tree and forest resources of Kinshasa’s wood-fuel supply basin and at- tempted to predict how they would evolve in the future. Maps were made for four periods (1984, 2001, 2006 and 2012) using a mosaic of four LANDSAT images. The above-ground biomass was estimated in 2012 using forest inventories in 317 plots distributed across the four types of plant cover found on the Bateke plateau (4,337 trees and 44 species were recorded). This inventory data com- bined with the satellite data allowed us to make the first comprehensive assessment of above-ground biomass in the study area. Be- tween 2000 and 2012, the average volume of wood-fuel fell by more than 50%. Over the entire period studied (1984 to 2012), carbon stocks fell by 75%. In the wood-fuel supply area for Kinshasa, the drastic loss of forest cover, shortened fallow periods, savannah encroachment and the decline of biomass and carbon stocks are clear signals of deg- radation. However, these initial estimations were derived from a small sample that was extrapolated to the entire supply area. It would be very useful to increase sampling in order to obtain more accurate and realistic figures. The experience of the Makala pro- ject clearly shows that the analysis of land cover change helps to understand and docu- ment the spatial organization and mecha- nisms of forest degradation. However, only with a sound wood-fuel resource policy and sustainable community land management, combined with very dynamic tree reintroduc- tion on agricultural land, will it be possible to initiate a sustainable process of restoration.","Baobab tree species plays a significant role in the livelihoods of rural dwellers in the Sahel regions. This study was carried out to analyze farmer’s perceptions on the impacts of Adansonia digitata L. leaves exploitation on its conservation and on livelihoods of local communities. Data were collected by interviewing 120 farmers to elucidate the impacts of leaves exploitation as well as the contribution of the species on their livelihoods. Descriptive statistics and multiple regression analysis were used to analyze the data to identify the annual contribution and to determine the socio-demographic characteristics influencing farmer’s perception of baobab leaves harvesting techniques. The results show that non-timber forest products (NTFPs) are the second pillar to support the respondents after agriculture. Their contribution European Scientific Journal, ESJ ISSN: 1857-7881 (Print) e ISSN 1857-7431 April 2021 edition Vol.17, No.13 www.eujournal.org 42 rate ranged between 4 and 7% in the study sites. The findings revealed that the annual income obtained per person from the exploitation of baobab leaves ranged from 33,714 FCFA (56.00 USD) to 52,857 FCFA (87.80 USD). Its contribution to annual household income varies between 2.51 and 5.4%. Two (used of machete and stick) out of the three (manual collection, used of machete and stick) methods used by farmers to harvest the baobab leaves, have negative impacts on baobab species conservation. Age, educational level, and gender are key factors influencing farmer’s perception of baobab leaves harvesting. In view of the importance of the baobab tree, it is imperative that the domestication and propagation of baobab trees should be supported through the adoption of improved agroforestry technologies. In addition, sustainable harvesting practices of baobab leaves is also recommended for the conservation of this species.","This study was conducted on an assessment of the various mitigation strategies to combat desertification in Jibia and Kaita Local Government Areas of Katsina State, Nigeria. The data use includes Satellite imageries for the study such as landsat MSS of 1976, landsat TM of 1987, SPOT XS of 1995 and landsat ETM of 2006 as well as structured questionnaires. Sixty close ended copies of the Questionnaire were administered in the study. Purposive sampling method of administering questionnaires was adopted. The percentages land mass covered for each of these variables was determined and estimated in M2. literature was obtained from various agencies which were responsible for desertification control in Katsina state. It was found from the reserved forest that in 1976 the percentage of reserved forest was 2.57%. In 1987 however, it increased by 73.9% to 76.47 %. By 1995, it declined by 9.42% to 67.05% and further declined by 0.52% in 2006. Effort to combat desertification through the use of reserved forest has been quite significant over the years. Also, noticed was a declined in shelter belt from 5.91% in 1987 to 1.097% in 1995 and a shot up to 7.39% in 2006. About 37% of the respondent opined that the deforestation leads to the disappearance of trees while 33% pinioned that it leads to reduction on agricultural productivity. The major strategy adopted to combat desertification is tree planting as supported by 88% of the respondents. It found that desertification as major environmental problem of the study area has reduced drastically from 43.34% in 1976 to 1.29% in 2006. It was also revealed from this study that some organizations such as European Economic Community/Katsina State government EEC/KTSG, Katsina Afforestation Project Unit KTAPU and Local Government Councils are the major agencies that are responsible for mitigating desertification in the study area.

The aim of this study was to determine tree density, diversity, biomass and carbon stock in farmlands in Senegal and to gain insight in the socio-economic determinants of the tree cover. An allometric model was developed to estimate the average above ground biomass (AGB) based on field investigations of 235.5 ha of agricultural fields. In total, 25 tree species were recorded with an average density of 1.6 tree ha-1 and a canopy cover of 1%. The AGB was 8.9 t. ha-1 corresponding to 4.45 t C ha-1. A single species, Cordyla pinnata, accounted for 50% of all the trees censured. Investigations of google Earth images showed considerable change in tree density during the investigated periods (2004, 2009 and 2013). The tree density decreased at the rate of 3% per year-1 from 2004-2009 and 6.4% per year-1 from 2009-2013. Based on these results, all the trees would be lost in 30 years from 2009 and in 16 years from 2013 if this trend continues. Informants were generally interested in increasing the number of fruit trees. On average, they were willing to allocate 19% of their land for planting of new trees. Tree planting, however, has not been traditionally considered an option by the landowners, since livestock damage on young trees was too big and fencing not an option, but the recent years tree planting with certification for carbon sale has been initiated with support from outside.Keywords: Africa, forest resources, deforestation, local management, woody biomass.","Tropical forests play an important role of storing significant quantities of carbon, both, aboveground and belowground. However, deforestation activities for various purposes, among them, agriculture and settlement, have continued to remove unknown quantities of biomass and carbon stocks across tropical forests of Africa. This study was conducted to estimate aboveground tree biomass (AGB), carbon stocks (AGCS) and carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2 e) among three vegetation cover types (wooded land, bushland and grassland) found in Mapfungautsi forest and to quantify the long-term estimated total AGB, AGCS and CO2 e lost due to deforestation activities in the forest (between the year 2000 and 2020). Data collection was conducted using remote sensing imagery, field measurements and an allometric equation. A total of 22 plots, each measuring 50m x50m were established across the three vegetation cover types where tree height, diameter at breast height, number of stems/ha and regeneration were measured. The collected data was analysed using EViews Version 10 software. Wooded land generally had the highest values across all the four tree growth variables followed by bushland and grassland. The average estimated AGB stored were 50.78t/ha, 14.7t/ha and 8.2 t/ha for wooded land, bushland and grassland respectively. From the 10632ha cleared over 20 years, losses amounting to an estimated mean total AGB, AGCS and CO2 e of 387669.53t, 182205.09t and 668692.69t respectively were observed. We conclude that quantifying and raising awareness about the lost AGB, AGCS and CO2 e among stakeholders will lead to the implementation of remedial action to replenish the lost biomass and carbon stocks.",24.5465735419243,3,Unlabeled

Although the term “ape-man” was used for early mankind who walked on two feet, improvements in the precision of dating methods and excavations from the latter half of the 20th century made it clear that many types of human species coexisted. Thus, the term “ape-man” is now only rarely used. Bipedalism was likely something attempted by many groups, and although many theories exist, the underlying reason for this transition is unclear.2 However, the advantages are clear – it enabled viewing vast distances and the use of hands to carry food, and ultimately led to the expansion of brain size. Interestingly, it took our ancestors an additional 4 million years to expand their brain size. This evolutionary delay might have been caused by climate changes in Africa. The progressively drying climate led to reductions in forestland, and our ancestors who lived on the plains were subjected to a new type of natural selection pressure, causing changes in their physique and behavior. One possible reason that orangutans remained in the trees when transported to Asia by continental drift was that although Africa and the Northern hemisphere began to dry and cool from approximately 30 million to 2.5 million years ago, Asia's forests in the tropical regions remained intact. Evidence of brain size expansion and the use of tools can be found from approximately 2.5 million years ago. Mankind at this stage is referred to as Homo habilis or Homo rudolfensis. The concept of pre-adaptation refers to gradually altering physique in advance so that it works to one's advantage once subjected to a particular environment. For instance, the advantages of walking erect are thought to have played an important role in the evolution of mankind much later; that is, approximately 2.5 million years later. The expansion of brain size also brought about a revolution in food energy, which accompanied the use of stone tools – the ability to ingest high caloric and nutritious meat products. Although they were “meat-eating” and hunted herbivorous animals on occasion, their meat supply likely came from food left over by carnivorous animals. In addition to increasing meat-eating efficiency, the expansion of brain size was accompanied by acquisition of modern man's physique, an expanded range of activity and loss of body hair. Although many human species remained in Africa, one group, the Peking man or Java man (also known as Homo erectus) moved to Eurasia approximately 1.8 million years ago in an event referred to as the first African exodus. At least one group of Homo erectus began using fire, a monumental event in mankind's history. Homo erectus existed until 250 000 years ago. We enter the age of modern man from approximately 200 000 years ago. The Neanderthals were another species of man that coexisted with modern humans during this period. This period saw the use of symbols, language and original art-forms. One group of modern humans left Africa approximately 100 000 years ago, and eventually adapted to all global environments in an event famously known as the second African exodus. Many terrains were conquered, including grasslands, deserts and mountains, and humans began living under various climates (tropical, temperate and polar). The conquering of various terrains is evidenced by the existence of Eskimos in polar regions, Bushmen in the deserts, Pygmies in the tropical rain forests, and Tibetan highlanders. The spreading of humans was particularly fast, with humans reaching Europe, Asia, North and South America, and Australia within the span of tens of thousands of years. Mankind at the time formed small nomadic groups and lived as hunter-gatherers. From a modest population of approximately 100 000 about 1 million years ago, the global population dramatically increased to 500 000 about 200 000 years ago, and further to approximately 10 million with the advent of agriculture about 10 000 years ago.3","Ceratocystis . Ceratocxstiopsis and  Ophiostoma are important pathogens of trees and some agricultural crops and have recently been found on proteas and forest trees in South Africa. Taxonomic controversy exists regarding these genera and ultrastructural studies on the development of asci, uniquely shaped ascospores and centrum structure are inadequate. This rev iew summarises current knowledge of ascospore shape and development of the centrum obtained from light and electron microscope studies of Cemtocystis sensu lato . Important questions requiring further investigations are outlined. It is furthermore proposed that additional ultrastructural studies are required to clarify the current taxonomic disagreement in this group. Such studies could also identify relationships between these fungi and other Ascomycetes.","The article examines the perspectives of summit diplomacy in relations between Russia and the countries of the African region. Summit diplomacy in the context of this article can be considered as an integral part of multi-vector network diplomacy, which is an effective addition, and sometimes an alternative to traditional diplomacy, despite the fact that officials also take part in the summits. The authors note that in studies on the diplomacy of summits, insufficient attention is paid to the substantive aspects of the relations between their participants. Thus, the summits imply consideration of a wide range of tasks, including those of a domestic political nature. At the same time, as an instrument of foreign policy, the effectiveness of summit diplomacy depends not only on the structural characteristics of relations, but also on the dynamics of interaction between the participants. The countries of the African region have rich mineral deposits, vast areas that could potentially be suitable for highly productive agriculture; forests, including the most valuable species of trees, as well as a huge population, which can become the basis for one of the world's largest markets for goods and services. It is African countries that occupy the first places in terms of GDP growth prospects and the rapidly growing economy as a whole. Transnational corporations have long been fighting for control over resources, access to cheap labor and the population's money, increasing their presence on the continent. In this regard, Africa has become the object of special attention of leading international players, including Russia. Thus, at present, a certain return of Russia's real interest in Africa is being ascertained. In the first part of the article, the authors analyze the economic opportunities of Russia and its main interests in relations with the countries of the African region. The second part deals with the development of Africa and the negotiating agenda of African states. The third part deals with new points of growth and promising areas of interaction between Russia and Africa.","Review: Old Fields: Dynamics and Restoration of Abandoned Farmland Viki A. Cramer and Richard J. Hobbs (Eds.) Reviewed by Joan Ellen Broome Georgia Southern University, USA Cramer, Viki A. and Richard J. Hobbs (Eds.). Old Fields: Dynamics and Restoration of Abandoned Farmland. Washington, D.C.: Island Press, 2007. 334 pp. ISBN 1597260754. US$40.00, paper. Recycled, acid free paper. The editors of Old Fields compiled what is the first international synthesis of research on the dynamics of land abandonment, whether it is former cropland, pasturage, or tree plantations. This alone makes it a laudable achievement. Both editors, Viki A. Cramer and Richard J. Hobbs, are affiliated with Murdoch University in Western Australia. Cramer is an ecologist in the School of Environmental Science where she teaches environmental restoration while Richard J. Hobbs is a fellow both there and at the Australian Academy of Science and serves as editor-in-chief of the journal Restoration Ecology. Together, in the first two chapters, they offer an overview of the body of work to date and outline the theoretical principles based on them. The case studies follow. Questions raised deal with the worldwide process of land abandonment and whether or not predictable patterns arise regardless of location. The post abandonment questions reckon with whether or not the dynamics of plant succession that follow once cultivated landscapes are peculiar to the locale or exhibit recognizable patterns globally. Why must these processes be investigated? Because understanding abandonment and post abandonment dynamics powerfully influence restoration ecology decisions. It is a useful work for scientists, practitioners and students of ecology. The interested generalist should await further synthesizing and a less technical approach. Cramer and Hobbs remind us that land abandonment is nothing new in human history. But the most recent version of it since records have been kept is instructive. The eastern U.S. became “the first region [on the planet] to experience significant abandonment of cropland from 1870 onward” (p. 3-5). The modern day experience in land abandonment has several causes. Among them are shifts in the demand for commodities in the world market that make a once intensely cultivated crop unprofitable; population explosions requiring human habitat development of former agricultural properties; intermittent environmental cataclysms like long term droughts; and long term abuses in production practices that led to catastrophes like deforestation. The research conducted covers a wide range of topographies. Case studies included are from Puerto Rico, Brazilian Amazonia, Australian Rain Forests, arid landscapes in Southeastern Spain and central Greece, shrub land in South Africa, and Michigan flatlands and the Piedmont area of New Jersey in the United States. One lapse in the book is the failure to mention one of the largest and dramatic restoration proposals in the U.S., which is also known as the “home of old fields ecology.” In the late 1980s, a super-sized restoration plan for the Great Plains poetically labeled “The Buffalo Commons” by the staid academicians who conceived it captured national headlines. The pair of scientists who devised this plan werefrom Rutgers University: Frank (international land use expert) and Deborah (geographer) Popper. The Poppers addressed their restoration plan at a conference of the Society for Ecological Restoration International in Chicago in June of 1990, where the couple and the concept (now accepted by initially hostile plains residents) received a warm welcome. The editors’ end chapter offers much to ponder as restoration ecology moves into new terrain, literally. Cramer and Hobbs observe that there are actually instances where restoration is not advisable. They rightly conclude that the models developed thus far were in “temperate areas of the Northern Hemisphere” and may not apply in the other regions featured in some of these case studies. In areas where intense cultivation followed by abandonment are recent, restoration based on historically documented species that once occupied the space is possible. However, for “cultural landscapes,” in Europe especially, where the original ecosystem was disturbed centuries ago, restoration ecology is less likely. This realization leaves room for other creative options for abandoned lands.","Studies on the palaeoecology of central Africa have traditionally documented the evolution of vegetation and particularly the role of climate in shaping tropical forest landscapes. These studies are few in number due to access difficulties for fieldwork and the great diversity of the plant species concerned. Moreover, the relationship between humans and their environment in these areas is still a relatively recent field of investigation. For this PhD, conducted on the basis of a multidisciplinary approach between archaeology and ecology, we examined past human activities in the northern Congo Basin and their impact on its forests as we see them today. Our analysis of the spatial and temporal framework of human activities in the Sangha River Interval shows the extent of current gaps in knowledge on human presence in this area. It also underlines the absence of human occupation between ~1300 and 600 BP in the study area. A methodology was therefore proposed to address these gaps, based on the acquisition and statistical analysis of charred botanical remains found in soils. The results showed a contrasting spatial pattern between domestic and agricultural areas. The combination of charred oil palm endocarps and potsherds suggests the presence of villages, while the presence of charcoal suggests the existence of cultivated fields. Furthermore, our analyses of the large datasets gathered (paleoecological, archaeological, historical and dendrological), focusing on the Sangha River Interval and covering the last millennium, highlight the effects of land use changes on the regeneration of four populations of light-demanding tree species currently exploited for their timber ( Erythrophleum suaveolens, Pericopsis elata, Terminalia superba and Triplochiton scleroxylon ). In particular, the analysis results highlighted the contributions to these changes of European colonization since the second half of the 19th century and the deficit in the regeneration of these light-demanding tree populations since that time. Thus, this thesis underlines not only the importance of the chronology and identification of past human activities in dense, humid forests, but also the impact of recent human history on central Africa´s forest landscapes. Finally, we identified a number of gaps in knowledge and put forward suggestions for future research, including for the benefit of forest managers.","Forests play an important role in maintaining rainfall patterns worldwide by recycling water back to the atmosphere through evapotranspiration. We present a novel spatiotemporal data-driven model and assessment of the impacts of various deforestation scenarios on rainfall patterns in sub-Saharan Africa, where rainfed agriculture is the main source of income and provides food for a large part of the population. Our model is based on the convolutional long short term memory neural network and uses a combination of climate and vegetation time-series data to predict rainfall and to perform simulation experiments. Our results show that complete deforestation (i.e. conversion of all humid forests to short grasslands) would greatly reduce rainfall magnitude in the deforested areas. Above the equator, the large majority of areas not currently forested would also receive less rainfall. However, complete deforestation would slightly increase rainfall in some parts of Southern Africa and decrease it in other parts. The impacts of partial deforestation also differ across Africa. In West Africa, even moderate tree cover loss (i.e. 30%) reduces rainfall magnitude whereas in Central and Southern Africa, a threshold of 70% tree cover loss is required to reduce rainfall magnitude. Deforestation of remaining humid rainforest areas is thus likely to dramatically affect rainfed agriculture across the continent, in particular in the maize-based cropping systems north of the equator.","Our present @Cabra Leche Sabana experience takes place in the plain lands1of Nor. East-Venezuela, South America, at a wide natural area of neo-tropical savannas. The specific local site, is an old XIX century cattle ranch (Hato Llanero), “Curareque Urica Arriba”, of the north-eastern Anzoátegui state, with its typical BiomeEcotone, of high (250-300mts), plain lands of varied natural grassland vegetation, predominantly of the Tachypogon2 Andropogon, and Setaria native grass species. The typical native tree species of these Anzoátegui’s “Chaparral” savannas are of the fire resistant species: Curatella American (“Chaparro”), Bowditch virgiliodes (“Alcornoque”), and Brysonima crassifolia (“Chaparro Manteco”), scatter all over the plain grassland areas, or in busy cluster of forest vegetation, usually at the better soil-water sites, protected from the risk of the annual fires. Among Botanical specialist, the common opinion is that our savannas are of an anthropological (human), origin. The result of the old sociocultural use of the fire for hunting practices of the native inhabitants, together with the new disturbances, brought by civilization and its modern agricultural and oil exploitation practices.2 Our neo/tropical Mesa de Sabana plain lands are of a younger geo-physiological formation age (Paliolitic Origen), than the ‘old world’ better known African Savannas. Having good tropical bio-diverse vegetation of dry forest (Hold ridge), with abundant small-life (insects), and microscopic fungal-bacterial fauna; but without the large wild-animals diversity of the older African Savannas. The general climate and rains of the area are typical of a geographical dry monzonic zone, with a main rain period (“invierno”), of 4-6months, where 70-75% of the annual 8501200mm rainfall is recorded. The dry period (“verano”), usually occurs between December and April each year, with May and November as intermediate months period. The year round temperature fluctuates on the 22-30C range, with a very windy period, at the “verano”, helping mitigate the day’s inclement temperature.3 The climate of the windy dry period at our high table savannas (“sabanas de mesa”), is quite similar to that of other world desert zones, having very hot sunny days with cold windy nights.","Abstract E. guineensis, the oil palm or African oil palm, is native to equatorial Africa, although the only other species in the genus (E. oleifera) is indigenous to South and Central America. E. guineensis, however, is the major economic species: fruits of E. oleifera have a much lower oil content and are used only locally (Westphal and Jansen, 1989). However, E. guineensis was introduced into South America during the time of the slave trade, and naturalized groves are reported in coastal areas of Brazil near Bélem. In the mid-1800s it was introduced to South-East Asia via the Botanic Gardens in Bogor, Indonesia. The first oil-palm estates in Sumatra (since 1911) and Malaysia (since 1917) used plant material from second- and third-generation descendants of the original Bogor palms, from which one of the breeding populations, the Deli Dura, is derived (Westphal and Jansen, 1989). After soyabean, E. guineensis is the second most important crop worldwide for the supply of edible vegetable oil. Palm oil kernel, for example, is a major agricultural export from Malaysia, and South-East Asia is the main area of production.E. guineensis yields two types of oil: palm oil from the fleshy mesocarp, and palm-kernel oil from the kernel, in a volume ratio 10:1. Most palm oil is used in food preparation (margarines, and industrial frying oils used to prepare snack foods, etc.). Palm-kernel oil is similar in composition and properties to coconut oil, and is used in confectionery, where its higher melting point is particularly useful. It is also used in the manufacture of lubricants, plastics, cosmetics and soaps. The oil palm is a monoecious, erect, single-stemmed tree usually 20-30 m high. The root system is shallow and adventitious, forming a dense mat in the top 35 cm of the soil. The main stem is cylindrical, up to 75 cm diameter. E. guineensis palm fronds are not as suitable for thatching as other palm species, as the leaflets attach to the rachis at two angles. The oil palm is indigenous to the lowland humid tropics, and thrives on a good moisture supply and relatively open conditions. It can tolerate fluctuating water-tables with periods of standing water, although continuously flooded conditions are unsuitable. Sites often selected as suitable for oil palm are swamps, riverbanks, or sites considered too moist for tropical rain forest trees. Rainfall is often the major factor limiting production in plantations: highest yields occur where rainfall is evenly distributed throughout the year, with an optimum of 150 mm per month (Westphal and Jansen, 1989). Oil palms can grow on a variety of soil types, from sandy soils to lateritic red and yellow podzols, young volcanic soils, alluvial clays and peat soils; water-holding capacity appears to be the most important soil criterion. It is a demanding crop in terms of soil nutrients. The oil palm also has potential for incorporation into agroforestry practices. Traditional oil palm management in some areas of West Africa often incorporated both pure oil palm groves (perhaps selectively retained), scattered oil palms within temporary fields, and unexploited oil palms in mixed forest (Gupta, 1993). Harvesting of fruits usually starts about 2½ years after field planting; bunches ripen throughout the year and so harvesting usually takes place at intervals of 2 to 3 weeks in any particular area. Because oil palm is so responsive to environmental conditions, yields may vary greatly. However, over the lifetime of a palm tree, yields generally rise to a maximum in the first 6-8 years (after field planting), and will subsequently decline slowly. In Malaysia and Sumatra, well-managed plantations yield between 24 and 32 tonnes/hectare of fruit bunches; the oil yield from this will be between 4.8 and 7 tonnes/hectare. Oil palm plantations are often regarded as a better use of the land than annual food crops in humid tropical areas where soils are prone to leaching: the plantations provide continuous ground cover, and the palm canopy helps protect against soil erosion. Oil palm stems are increasingly used as a raw material for paper and composite board production. This area has big prospects in wood-based industries. It is recommended that more research is undertaken into the properties and utilization. Propagation techniques, the management of pests and diseases, and genetic resources are other areas in which studies could usefully be undertaken.","The rainforests are the great green heart of Africa, and present a unique combination of ecological, climatic and human interactions. In this synthesis paper, we review the past and present state processes of change in African rainforests, and explore the challenges and opportunities for maintaining a viable future for these biomes. We draw in particular on the insights and new analyses emerging from the Theme Issue on ‘African rainforests: past, present and future’ of Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B. A combination of features characterize the African rainforest biome, including a history of climate variation; forest expansion and retreat; a long history of human interaction with the biome; a relatively low plant species diversity but large tree biomass; a historically exceptionally high animal biomass that is now being severely hunted down; the dominance of selective logging; small-scale farming and bushmeat hunting as the major forms of direct human pressure; and, in Central Africa, the particular context of mineral- and oil-driven economies that have resulted in unusually low rates of deforestation and agricultural activity. We conclude by discussing how this combination of factors influences the prospects for African forests in the twenty-first century.","As the topic of gender and forests gains international attention through programs related to addressing the Sustainable Development Goals, we focus on a case study of the African Locust Bean (Parkia biglobosa) in the savannah landscape of northern Ghana. Although this tree holds high cultural significance for Dagomba women, it is unfortunately becoming scarcer in our study area near Tamale. We investigate the reasons for this decline in relation to the agricultural, ecological, and cultural landscape and discuss the gendered impacts of these changes. Research in these communities was conducted between 2018 and 2021 as part of a transdisciplinary action research approach to process underutilized species with women’s groups. The research started with a survey that included 27 women’s groups in 13 communities with 524 women participants. Out of a selected number of groups, our research team has worked more intensively with three women’s groups near Nyankpala, which selected for their processing focus the African Locust Bean, locally known as dawadawa. More than 45 group sessions were organized with seven groups in a collaborative learning process in 2019. Additionally, the three groups in Kpachi who chose to process the African Locust Bean sustained facilitation of group activities until the end of 2021. Specifically, on the topic of the decline of this tree, 19 semistructured interviews were conducted in August 2020 with 8 female farmers, 7 male farmers and 4 chiefs in the local governance system. Our results show the cultural significance of the African Locust Bean for women in the Dagomba culture as well as practical uses of all parts of the tree. Specifically, the seeds are used for making a fermented condiment and tea. Although seeds of the African Locust Bean are considered a women’s crop, their access to this tree is mediated by the local chiefs and often male land-users. Most farmers interviewed reported a reduction in trees in their fields. The reasons for the decrease can be summarized in six different categories, (1) aging tree populations, (2) challenge caring for saplings until maturity, (3) agricultural changes with increased mechanization and pesticide use, (4) over-use as a firewood resource, (5) usufruct rights between traditional chiefs, male land-owners, and women who should be granted access to the trees according to Dagomba cultural values, and (6) reduced water availability inhibits seed yield. In conclusion, there is an urgent need for action to protect and restore the African Locust Bean within northern Ghana’s savannah landscape to ensure continued access and benefits of the tree to women in the region.",23.4493998248214,1,Unlabeled
