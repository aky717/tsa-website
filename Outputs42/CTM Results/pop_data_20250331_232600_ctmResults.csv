Despite the novelty of organic-based technologies in enhancing agricultural production in Kenya's central highlands, adoption is low. Therefore, we carried out a cross-sectional household survey of 300 randomly selected smallholder farmers to determine the specific organic-based practices by farmers; and the socioeconomic factors that influence the adoption intensity of selected organic-based technologies. We used descriptive statistics to summarize the data and the Tobit regression model to evaluate the socioeconomic determinants of adoption intensity of selected organic-based technologies. We identified nine organic-based technologies that had different adoption rates among the farmers. The majority of the farmers had adopted manure (97%) and manure combined with fertilizer (92%) in Murang'a and Tharaka-Nithi, respectively. Manure was applied to the largest land in Murang'a with 31% of the cultivated land. In comparison, manure combined with fertilizer had the highest adoption intensity in Tharaka-Nithi applied to about 25% of the cultivated land. Gender, age of the household head, level of education, household size, access to external labor, training, Tropical Livestock Unit, agriculture group membership, access to credit, land cultivated, and farming experience influenced the adoption intensity of organic-based technologies among smallholder farmers. Based on the smallholder farmers' adoption behavior, this study can be used to disaggregate the farming households better in order to tailor specific organic-based soil fertility technologies solutions that meet their unique needs. One group would be those households that face specific constraints, as reflected in their low adoption rates, women-headed households and older farmers, and thus require more targeted / intensive efforts to overcome these barriers. The other group would be those households that require less focus because, when confronted with the technologies, they are more likely to adopt them easily, for example, the male-headed households. Hence, the smallholder farmers' adoption behavior, can enable policymakers to form a base for designing appropriate policies that encourage the adoption of organic-based soil fertility technology by smallholder farmers.","Agricultural transformation is key to poverty reduction and food security in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). In Rwanda, this transformation has focused on shifting subsistence-based production to market-oriented farming. Over the last one decade and a half, major emphasis has been placed on the intensification of production systems, promotion of farmers’ cooperatives, and enhancement of farmers’ access to markets. Although the country recorded an increase in food crop commercialization, subsistence farming is still prevalent amongst smallholder farmers. Yet, in the few studies conducted on agricultural transformation, smallholder commercialization has received scanty attention. As the country aims to achieve commercialized agriculture, there is a need to understand what factors can influence farmers’ decisions to participate in the output markets. This study analyses the levels of market participation and drivers of output commercialization, using a sample of 256 Common bean farmers from northern Rwanda. A double-hurdle model was used to analyse the data. Results indicated that 30% of the farmers participated in the market with an average commercialization index of 0.42. Land size, agricultural training and group membership of household head had a positive effect on households’ participation to bean market. The distance to the nearest access road that can be used throughout the year reduces the probability of commercialization at household level. The degree of market participation was positively influenced by price, education level of the household head and livestock income. On the other hand, distance to key markets had a negative effect on the degree of households’ commercialization. The findings of this paper show that participation in bean markets is still low, with disparities in the commercialized quantities amongst those who participate. Female-headed households were more likely to participate in bean markets, selling higher volumes than male-headed households. This gender difference suggests that bean production can be an important source of income for women smallholder farmers. The study recommends more efforts in improving road networks connecting to key markets, facilitating cross-border trade and increasing agricultural training amongst the farmers. Additionally, the use of improved inputs in bean production as well as income diversification through livestock rearing should be encouraged. All the interventions should be gender-sensitive so as not to deny women their source of livelihood through bean production and marketing.

The purpose of this study was to assess determinants of market participation and its contribution to household food security. The secondary data used in this study were collected from 1520 respondents; however, 389 smallholder farmers participated in the market. The Household Food Insecurity Access Scale revealed that out of the total sample size, 85% of the households were food insecure while 15% were food secure. Gender of household head, receiving social grants and higher wealth index positively impacted market participation. Having a family member with HIV had a negative impact on market participation among smallholder farmers. The results from the extended ordered probit regression model showed that household size, having a family member with HIV and agricultural assistance had a positive and significant contribution to the household food insecurity situation of the smallholder farmers. On the other hand, the educational level of household head, ownership of livestock, age of household head, gender of household head, and having access to social grants had a negative and significant effect on the food insecurity status. Access to education and the market can improve household food security. Linking smallholder farmers, particularly women and aged farmers, to markets should form an intrinsic part of the government’s efforts to improve farming and food security and increase access to diversified food.","This study investigates backyard farming and implications for food security in Nigeria. Purposive random sampling technique was used in this study to obtain a total of 80 respondents as sample size. Data were collected using structured questionnaire copies. Data generated were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics. The result showed that the respondents` mean age was 43 years. Women (71%) were more involved in backyard farming than males (29%). Identified mixtures of backyard household agricultural enterprises in order of preference by respondents were: vegetable growing (88.75%) > cassava cropping (76.25%) > yam cropping (67.50%) > maize cropping (52.50%) > plantain cropping (46.25%) > poultry farming (41.25%). A high satisfaction level was recorded in terms of farm yield (¨xx = 2.39) and food security (¨xx = 2.34). Extension workers` visits to farmers (31.25%) were poor. Risk level was low (¨xx =2.25). The result indicates a significant and positive relationship between farmers` adoption of improved crop varieties and access to extension services. The study recommends that advocacy should be scaled up for more family participation in backyard farming since it has the capacity for food security, income generation, and rural development.","This paper studies the relationship between the Women’s Empowerment in Agriculture Index (WEAI) and market orientation of farm production in India. This is the first time that the WEAI has been used in an Indian agricultural context and the first time that it is being associated with market orientation. We used data on 1920 adults from 960 households in the Chandrapur District of Maharashtra and classified the households into three groups—(1) landless, (2) food-cropping, and (3) cash-cropping—that reflect increasing degrees of market orientation. We foind that women are disempowered in two major domains of agriculture—resources (access and decision-making) and leadership (group membership). A multivariate regression analysis shows that empowerment levels were significantly higher for women belonging to cash-cropping households, followed by food-cropping and landless households. Other significant determinants of empowerment scores are women’s age, education level, and household-level characteristics such as ownership of livestock, irrigation, electricity, and amount of land owned. As a secondary objective of this paper, we find that women’s empowerment in agriculture was also significantly associated with their decision-making in non-agricultural domains. The strong relationship between market orientation and empowerment levels suggests that linking women to markets can be a pathway to enhancing their empowerment in agricultural domains. Ensuring their ability to make decisions related to the cultivation of crops and their participation in the sale of those crops, with associated income, can be some areas for which relevant policies can be designed, tried, and studied.","Enhancing profit efficiency in vegetable farming is important to increase income, livelihoods, and nutrition security, and to reduce poverty of smallholder farmers, particularly in developing countries. This study examined the profit efficiency and its determinants in smallholder vegetable farms in Nepal using the stochastic translog profit function with cross-section data collected in 2013. The results revealed a high level of inefficiency in vegetable farms because of the combined effects of technical, allocative, and scale inefficiencies. The profitability differential in vegetable farms is significantly explained by input variables, namely, labor, land, seeds, fertilizer, pesticides, and capital. The determinants of profit inefficiency in vegetable farming were the types of crop varieties, access to information and extension services, access to agricultural credit, distance of farms to markets, and sex of farm manager. The profit efficiency in vegetable farming can be enhanced by adopting improved seed varieties, improving effective information and extension programs, increasing accessibility of credit facilities to the farmers, developing market infrastructure, and empowering women farmers in vegetable farming that leads to improve household income and nutrition security.","Smallholder farmers are major contributors of horticultural produce. Women’s contribution is noteworthy. Meeting market demand on time and avoiding market ‘floods’ is a challenge among communal farmers, leading to post harvest losses partly due to lack of information and uninformed decision making. Mobile phones have potential to connect farmers to markets, close the information gap and enable informed decisions. Currently most farmers target a few markets leading to market ‘floods’, low prices and fresh produce deterioration while some potential markets remain untapped. A survey conducted in 2015 covering 131 farmers in Svosve-Wenimbi, Marondera district of Mashonaland East province in Zimbabwe evaluated mobile phone ownership and use in farming; and its potential in transforming production and marketing. High literacy and mobile phone ownership of 95.32% and 94.45% respectively was reported, with 16% already accessing advisory services over mobile phone. 51.1% utilised various mobile phone services including accessing market information on inputs and produce, advisory services, weather data, mobile phone money transfers for transaction and crop insurance. By using mobile phones farmers made informed decisions and saved time and transport cost. Mobile phone ICT can promote better production, marketing, food security and livelihoods and more farmers may adopt the technology.

A total of 120 cassava farmers comprising 60 men and 60 women were randomly selected. Data were collected with a structured questionnaire and analyzed using descriptive statistics, multiple regression and Z–test. Results show that the men had mean age of 44.5 years and 47 years for the women, majority 93.3% (men) and 81.6% (women) were married, most 61.6% (men) and 51.7% (women) attended secondary school and had mean farming experience of 14.9 years (men) and 12.7 years (women). The major sources of information on cassava production activities used by the farmers were Agricultural Development Programme (ADP) and fellow farmers. Results further showed that women were more involved (  x  = 2.0) than the male cassava farmers (  x  =1.8) in cassava production activities. The factors that influenced the men’s involvement in cassava production activities were household size, farm income and farm size whereas marital status, farming experience and education were the major factors that influenced women’s participation in the process. Meanwhile, there was a significant difference in the level of involvement of the men and women farmers in cassava production activities at 1.0% level of probability. The study concludes that women are more involved in cassava production activities than men. This study therefore recommends formulation of gender sensitive policies, land reforms, free and affordable education for women farmers for enhanced cassava production.

The main goal of this paper is to examine the crucial roles of women’s empowerment and LTPRs as they affect household food security among smallholder farmers in Nigeria. Cross-sectional data were obtained from 1152 maize and rice farmers, selected by multistage random sampling across 192 communities, 16 States and the six geopolitical zones in Nigeria. The data were collected on households’ socio-economics, food security situations, empowerment and LTPRs on parcels cultivated during the 2016/17 farming season by interviewing the adult members of the farmers’ households. HFS was assessed using the United States Department of Agriculture’ HFS Survey Module and Food and Agriculture Organization guidelines for measuring Household Dietary Diversity Score. LTPRs were measured in terms of tenure type and title registration to farmlands. HFS modelling was within the framework of Poisson, Instrumental Variable Poisson (IVP) and Zero-inflated Poisson (ZIP) regression methods, with endogeneity concerns and choice of specification addressed within Hausman specification tests. The results of the study show that households that have a share of farmland on purchase and also participate in off-farm activities are likely to be certainly food-secure in all regards. Crop diversity, households that cultivate maize only, the share of farmland on purchase and access to extension contact significantly reduce the severity of food insecurity while an increase in farm size increases the severity of food insecurity. Similarly, IV Poisson and ZIP Count results show that increase in the farm size results in the severity of food insecurity. The evidence with respect to women’s empowerment reveals that gender parity and female achievement in group membership, income control, as well as workload; reduce the extent of food insecurity among the farming households in Nigeria. We, however, discover that the female achievement in the productive decision and credit increases the severity of food insecurity among the smallholder farmers. The analyses also reveal that education of the household head, female achievement in the asset; group membership and workload are the major factors that positively influenced household dietary diversity. The study suggests the adoption of climate-smart practices to overcome the issue of marginal farmlands, promotion of crop and livelihood diversification among the smallholder farmers, effective extension services delivery, and improving women’s access to productive resources to enhance household food security status in Nigeria.","This study was carried out to identify the factor which influences rural women’s income after participation in small-scale agricultural farming, their contribution to the household, as well as their empowerment status. This research was conducted in Jinaigati upazila of Sherpur district in Bangladesh. A total of 80 respondents (women) from this upazilla of Sherpur were selected purposively using simple random sampling. The quantitative data were collected by in depth interviewing of the 80 respondents through personal interview. The quantitative analytical tools used to attain specific objectives included various descriptive statistics, functional analysis, multiple regression co-efficient, used to identify the factors of influencing women’s income through small-scale agricultural farming. Problem Confrontation Index (PCI) used through different problems identified scores. In accordance with the results of the educational level of woman, other sources of income, experience and training, access to credit, decision-making ability have a positive influence on rural women’s income, and these variables were statistically significant. From the Problem Confrontation Index, it was found that lack of capital was the first ranked problem, need-based training the second ranked problem, high interest rate the third ranked problem, insufficient farm size the fourth ranked problem, and lack of quality of seed the fifth ranked problem. Their income from this brought remarkable positive change in their life and they had better control over their decisions and income. Finally, their active economical participation in small-scale farming assists them to overcome prejudice, socio-economic barriers, and highest empowerment attainment in the context of Bangladesh—and, if the government takes proper initiative in terms of gender policy, then rural women’s income and livelihood status will be increased remarkably.",22.9786905341555,Women in Agriculture

Our focus in this paper is specifically on men who established formal collaborative arrangements (Joint Farming Ventures, JFVs) with fellow farmers, including family members. We present an empirical analysis of primary qualitative data, using the Biographic Narrative Interpretive Method (BNIM), which has particular analytical purchase in the study of identity. Our analysis finds that formal collaborative arrangements in the form of JFVs are employed as resilience strategies by male farmers. The strategies strive to continue the performance of some traditional masculinity traits but markedly involve the renegotiation of hegemonic masculine identity forms, resonant with debates elsewhere on reconstituting gender norms in family farming. Our narrative analysis finds that men’s entry to and operation of JFVs entail a conscious and active relinquishing of dominant decisionmaking power on their farms, an openness to the views and opinions of others, and a greater willingness to helpseek and express emotions. Introduction Male farmer identity has been traditionally characterised in the sociological literature as hegemonic, scripted by narratives of hard work, tenacity, self-reliance and provision, reinforced by men’s position as head of and ‘breadwinner’ for the farm household (Brandth, 1995; Saugeres 2002; Shortall and Byrne, 2009). However, socio-cultural and economic challenges to hegemonic masculinity (Alston and Kent, 2008; Bryant and Pini, 2011; Shortall, 2014) have emerged over the past two decades. In the first instance, the performative characteristics of traditional hegemonic male identity appear out-dated in an increasingly globalised agricultural economy, where farm family selfsubsistence is increasingly rare. The traditional value of physical work, tenacity and self-reliance continues to be esteemed at some level in agricultural communities, but where farms are integrated into low-cost, high-scale global commodity markets it is increasingly difficult for family farmers to financially sustain a livelihood (Ní Laoire, 2005). Off-farm work is now a crucial feature of farm household resilience, with farm women frequently participating in the off farm labour market as breadwinners, which in turn can present threats to men’s traditional identities as providers for the family (Kelly and Shortall, 2002; Shortall, 2014; Riley and Sangster, 2017). In such transitional contexts, contemporary rural men can experience feelings of ‘entrapment and hopelessness’, compounded by factors such as unprofitable agriculture and stifling socio-cultural conditions in rural and agricultural communities (Ní Laoire, 2001, 233). Against this backdrop, farming is for some This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved. considered a ‘poisoned chalice’ (Kelly and Shortall, 2002), with males possibly coerced by longstanding socio-cultural norms to keep the farm intact and retain the lineage of family ownership. Once the dominant head of the household and farm, a role vested with prestige and status, many farming men are ever increasingly on the verge of ‘being defined as abandoned, unmodern and even pitiable’ (Brandth 2002, 191). In the second instance, discussions of male farmer identity in the literature have strongly relied on Connell’s (1995) concept of hegemonic masculinity, which refers to a particular set of masculine traits that are socio-culturally exalted. However, it is also the case that any discussion of identity must take into account the dynamic nature of its formation and re-formation. Transactional and performative, identity operates at the levels of the ‘self and the social’ (Byrne, 2003; Cush et al., 2017). While discussions in the literature of male identity are often principally informed by hegemonic masculinity, we are cognisant that it does not exclusively define male farmer identity. Of course, there are alternative, cultural forms of identity with dynamic masculine constructions. It is in this context that we recognise male farmer identity as non-essentialist and as having the capacity at the levels of the self and the social to be dynamic and responsive to different scenarios. The analysis of this paper is therefore located in the theoretical interplay between the concepts of identity and masculinity, contributing to the existing debate on ‘reconstituting’ relationships in family farming and implications arising for gendered identities and masculinities. Drawing from a larger study, our focus in this paper is specifically on men who established Joint Farming Ventures (JFVs), which are formal cooperative arrangements identified internationally as resulting in social, economic and cultural benefits to those involved (Barthez, 2000; Egil-Flø, 2006; Almas, 2010; Macken-Walsh and Roche, 2012). We present an empirical analysis of primary qualitative data, using the Biographic Narrative Interpretive Method (BNIM), which has particular analytical purchase in the study of identity. Our analysis finds that formal collaborative arrangements in the form of Joint Farming Ventures (JFVs) are employed as a resilience strategy by farmers in responding to threats. The narratives of the farming males involved in JFVs evidence a continuation of the performance of traditional masculinity traits but also the renegotiation and reconstitution of This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved. masculine identity. Resonant with the concept of reconstituting gender relationships, we find evidence of dialogic masculinity (Peter et al., 2000) in the narratives of the male interviewees. Our narrative analysis finds that men’s entry to and operation of JFVs signals an active relinquishing of dominant decision-making power on their farms, an openness to the views and opinions of others, a greater willingness to help-seek and the expression of emotions. Identity and masculinity Our theoretical framework relies on the concepts of identity and masculinity while considering the analytical purchase of narrative analysis in exploring these concepts. Where identity is concerned, following Byrne (2003, 6) we distinguish between self and social identity on the basis that ‘gender, like identity, is simultaneously internal and external to the person’. Female and male identities are often mis-treated as dichotomous despite the ‘across-gender fluidity of emotional lives’ (Cleary, 2005, 156). There is general acceptance that identity is subjectively and relationally dynamic in the sense that it is ‘formed, performed and recreated’ (Shortall, 2017, 162) but also, at the social level, the category of gender is recognised as being particularly ‘stubborn’ (Shortall, 2017, 163). As explained by Byrne (2003, 6): “Gender is regarded as involved in the primary ordering of social identities: it is a collective categorisation, marking boundaries of difference between female and male, stressing similarity within these social categories, but also emphasising difference within hierarchies of males and females. It is deeply implicated in the composition of self-identity, affecting personal conceptions of social identities of womanhood or manhood”. Thus, while male identity may not be treated as essentialist, gender identities at the level of the social in particular can appear to be hegemonic especially in traditionally gendered occupations such as farming (see Shortall, 2016, for a review). In this context, a discussion of gendered identities in agriculture may leverage the rich literature on femininities and masculinities (Brandth, 1995; Bryant and Pini, 2011; Pini, Brandth and Little, 2014). ‘Masculinity’, for instance, is simply defined as This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved. possession of the characteristics typically associated with men. Hegemonic masculinity, on the other hand, is where a certain set of masculine traits are culturally exalted above other types of masculinity (Connell, 1995). This set of masculine traits represent a set of expectations for boys and men in the expression of their masculinity and ‘stands as a normative conception to which men are held accountable’ (Kane, 2006, 152). Traditional male farmer identity is consistent with what Connell (1995) coined hegemonic masculinity. Within this hegemonic masculinity, in place for well over a century in many cultures, gender norms and patriarchy position the male farmer as head of the household, affirmed by particular types of occupational traits centred on farm work. Central traits are an ability to attend to the physical demands of farming through hard work; displaying the necessary acumen to overcome difficult environmental and market conditions; a capacity for tenacity in the face of such challenges; and occupying the breadwinner role for the household (Liepins 1998; Saugeres 2002a and 2002b; Bartlett and Conger, 2004; Ní Laoire, 2005). Hegemonic masculinity impacts on male farmer identity by bearing the influence of culturally exalted traits on identity formation, performance and recreation. Hegemonic masculinity is largely a consequence of the social and cultural conventions of agriculture, where patrilineal succession norms typically favoured the eldest son as the rightful heir to the farm, bestowing a clear identity upon the farming male from a young age (Shortall and Byrne, 2009; Cassidy and McGrath, 2014; Fischer and Burton, 2014). Accompanying patrilineal succession is a gendering of the farm, supporting the male subject position as possessing innate knowledge of the land and farming matters (Leckie 1996; Saugeres 2002b). Media representations of farming have perpetuated the discursive construction of farming as a masculine enterprise, dependent on masculinised traits of hard work, strength and tenacity (Duggan 1987; Brandth 1995;","Problem statement: Agriculture has been proved to be a significant impetus for development in Malaysia. Agriculture offers a number of profitable activities, contract farming is one of it and it is still in infancy stage. Besides being a developed sector in Malaysia, it still has a number of problems to be solved. Gender issue is one of it. Gender issue in agriculture has become more crucial these days. To sustain the agriculture sector especially contract farming, an equal level of acceptance, attitude and knowledge towards contract farming should be gained between male and female. Approach: This study investigated whether male and female have any difference on acceptance, attitude and knowledge towards contract farming. Data was gained through a survey questionnaire on 400 male and female youth who are currently studying in various tertiary institutions throughout Malaysia. For the purpose of analyses, PASW software was used where descriptive and inferential analyses were employed. Results: Male and female youth were found to have a good and positive level on acceptance, attitude and knowledge towards contract farming. Based on the independent t-test done, male and female youth possessed equal level of acceptance, attitude and knowledge towards contract farming. Conclusion/Recommendations: Results gained bring us to the conclusion that contract farming has a huge potential to attract youth to be part of agriculture community. To transform this potential agricultural method to a reality, more promotion, exposure and information on contract farming should be given to the youth. It was recommended that related agriculture agencies, Department of Women Development and agriculture related universities to take the responsibilities of exposing contract farming activities to the youth in Malaysia.","Important social and agrarian changes are taking place on the agricultural plain of the Saiss in Morocco. Rural young men and women are key players in this process. In this article, we use the experiences, aspirations and dreams of rural young people in the Saiss to describe and discuss current agrarian dynamics to 1) illustrate how these are intimately linked to agrarian transformation; 2) demonstrate how futures and identities are deeply gendered; and 3) provide nuance to structural analyses of agrarian change with ethnographic accounts of how changes are perceived by the people experiencing them. Our analysis shows how young people skillfully and cautiously negotiate space to realize their aspirations. In doing so they carve out new and more modern farming identities and are able to combine rurality with modernity. Nevertheless, they are situated in web of power relations hampering the fulfillment of their aspirations and dreams. This forces some to put their dreams on hold and find alternative futures, a result that will strongly influence and determine the future of the countryside.","Gender differences in rural enterprise are a relevant field of analysis which calls for a deeper investiga-tion concerning key variables affecting farm’s performance and on the basis of gender. This paper tries to explore eventual gender gaps in the farms of Italy. Two variables are investigated: “Who” variable discriminate farm’s manager on the basis of gender under a constituent perspective of female entrepre-neurship. “Where” context is articulated in business, social and spatial context, with the aim of excavat-ing the multiple dimensions of farm entrepreneurship. In order to bring out the differences between male and female condominium farms in Italy, an econometric model was applied, with the aim of identifying context-related differences. The results confirm gender gaps related to farm performance, networking, diversification strategies and access to rural policies, by enlightening diverse paths of development in rural enterprises on the basis of explanatory variables. Therefore, adopted methodology reveals its utility in explaining gender gaps and addressing targeted policy implication at the beginning of a new program-ming era for the Common Agricultural Policy of the EU.","Gendered relations in resource access and farming are two important intersecting themes of gender studies in a northern rural context. However, conventional analysis and perceptions of the economy conceal the contribution of women within families, in businesses and in the labor market. This article demonstrate the significance of capital to farming women’s engagement with agriculture using a Swedish case study, based on descriptive analyses of data from the Federation of Swedish Farmers. To disclose the embodiment of family farming, gendered control of land, business activities and farm incomes is analyzed. On this empirical basis, we argue for reconstitution of farm-related entrepreneurial research, rural development policies and rural gender studies from a new material feminist approach. Access to resources, typically land, together with social forces and embodied experiences constitute the basis of strategic focus and agency. We demonstrate that acknowledgement of access to resources in the research process and in the understanding of social relations, resistance and situated knowledge are essential.","In Uganda, the agricultural sector contributes substantially to gross domestic product. Although the involvement of Ugandan women in this sector is extensive, female farmers face significant obstacles, caused by gendering that impedes their ability to expand their family business and to generate incomes. Gender refers to social or cultural categories by which women–men relationships are conceived. In this study, we aim to investigate how gendering influences the development of business relationships in the Ugandan agricultural sector. To do so, we employed a qualitative–inductive methodology to collect unique data on the rice and cassava sectors. Our findings reveal at first that, in the agricultural sector in Uganda, inter-organization business relationships (i.e., between non-family actors) are mostly developed by and between men, whereas intra-organization business relationships with family members are mostly developed by women. We learn that gendering impedes women from developing inter-organization business relationships. Impediments for female farmers include their restricted mobility, the lack of trust by men, their limited freedom in communication, household duties, and responsibilities for farming activities up until sales. Our findings also reveal that these impediments to developing inter-organization business relationships prevent female farmers from being empowered and from attainting economic benefits for the family business. In this context, the results of our study show that grouping in small-scale cooperatives offers female farmers an opportunity to overcome gender inequality and to become economically emancipated. Thanks to these cooperatives, women can develop inter-organization relationships with men and other women and gain easier access to financial resources. Small-scale cooperatives can alter gendering in the long run, in favor of more gender equality and less marginalization of women. Our study responds to calls for more research on the informal economy in developing countries and brings further understanding to the effect of gendering in the Ugandan agricultural sector. We propose a theoretical framework with eight propositions bridging gendering, business relationship development, and empowerment and economic benefits. Our framework serves as a springboard for policy implications aimed at fostering gender equality in informal sectors in developing countries.","Communal lands and natural resources in rural Cambodia have transformed over the past 30 years as the country attempts to transition from conflict to liberal democracy and integrates into global agricultural value chains. We find that gender relations are changing as a result of land privatization and the ensuing social and ecological crises of production and reproduction. The forest has become a space for the articulation of new masculinities modulated through class and racialised power, while women are increasingly relegated to the private space of the home and village, negotiating expectations that they perform care, farming and food provisioning work while juggling household debt. We ground our argument in a large sample of qualitative interviews conducted between 2016 and 2020 in the upland provinces of Kampong Thom, Kratie and Ratanakiri that provide narrative accounts of the transformation of common forest and grazing lands, logging livelihoods and food provisioning practices. Using a feminist political ecology perspective, we highlight the contradictory processes of enclosure of the commons, which operate simultaneously as sites of violence, resistance, adaptation and continuity.","ABSTRACT Human-nature connectedness is key to foster environmental and socio-cultural sustainability in agricultural landscapes since it promotes the establishment of belonging, stewardship, and connections to nature. Cooperation, collective action, and the role of women at sustainable agroecological practices could be leverage points in which small interventions may hold great potential for system transformation. We analyse the different types of human-nature connectedness mediated by the Agrolab participatory collective farming initiative running in Madrid (Spain). Our results described and quantified a participatory collective farming initiative using the leverage point perspective, and identified factors explaining nature relatedness of participants (i.e. social importance of agricultural landscapes, linkages with farming activities, time spent outdoors, gender and a negative relationship with the rural residence). We found that women showed a stronger and broader worldview on the philosophical arguments about their connection with nature, while men identified themselves and nature through more cognitive responses. Our results give indication of participatory collecting farming as a leverage point to foster human-nature connectedness. Finally, we discussed how participatory collective farming activities are suitable for introducing nature into people’s daily lives and may help to identify pathways towards a stronger human-nature connectedness.","Abstract Family farming plays a vital role in mountain areas. Its survival is related to multiple factors, including intrafamily farm succession. This study examined data on apple-producing family farms in an Italian Alpine valley, trying to identify which factors foster or discourage intrafamily succession and to what extent they do this, both at the farm level and from the potential successor's viewpoint. To do so, various farm, farmer, and individual characteristics were analyzed using probabilistic regression. We found that intrafamily succession was more likely when the farm was managed by a woman (+20%) with a high school diploma (+13%) who had at least 1 child with specialized education in agriculture (+27%) and when farm sales had increased in recent years (+25%). We also found that a child's willingness to take over the family farm decreases as the number of farm children increases and when the child is a female with a high school diploma; however, the likelihood that children will take over the family business rises as farmer education level and work experience increase. These findings, while mixed, suggest that women play a key role in keeping family farming alive in mountain areas, along with education of family members, improved marketability of agricultural products, and in general, competitiveness and profitability of the family farm.","Rwanda has experienced significant economic growth following the 1994 Genocide. This growth is attributed to the expansion of its agricultural sector, specifically farming intensification and the government’s focus on creating strong agriculture cooperatives. While Rwanda’s economic development has been impressive, many academics have argued that Rwanda’s growth comes at the cost of an authoritarian governmental regime, whose policies have too heavy a hand in the daily activities of smallholder farming. This study measures smallholder maize farmer loyalty to their cooperatives using the net promoter scores of five different cooperatives. Results differ from much of the recent research on smallholder farmers in Rwanda in that most cooperative members have high levels of trust in their cooperative leaders. Cooperative members who have high levels of trust in their cooperative president, board and the Government of Rwanda are more likely to recommend their cooperative to friends and family. Furthermore, women cooperative members have higher levels of trust in cooperative leadership, the Government of Rwanda and almost all agricultural input providers mentioned in the study. Findings suggest that cooperative policy, most notably the mandatory inclusion of high numbers of women in cooperative decision-making, is helping to promote strong agricultural institutions as well as sustainable economic development.",16.9232280132577,Farm Mechanization

Objectives: We examined associations between RA and pesticides or other agricultural exposures among female spouses of licensed pesticide applicators in the Agricultural Health Study. Methods: Women were enrolled between 1993 and 1997 and followed through 2010. Cases (n = 275 total, 132 incident), confirmed by a physician or by self-reported use of disease modifying antirheumatic drugs, were compared with noncases (n = 24,018). Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated using logistic regression models adjusted for age, state, and smoking pack-years. Results: Overall, women with RA were somewhat more likely to have reported lifetime use of any specific pesticide versus no pesticides (OR = 1.4; 95% CI: 1.0, 1.6). Of the 15 pesticides examined, maneb/mancozeb (OR = 3.3; 95% CI: 1.5, 7.1) and glyphosate (OR = 1.4; 95% CI: 1.0, 2.1) were associated with incident RA compared with no pesticide use. An elevated, but non-statistically significant association with incident RA was seen for DDT (OR = 1.9; 95% CI: 0.97, 3.6). Incident RA was also associated with the application of chemical fertilizers (OR = 1.7; 95% CI: 1.1, 2.7) and cleaning with solvents (OR = 1.6; 95% CI: 1.1, 2.4), but inversely associated with lifetime livestock exposure as a child and adult (OR = 0.48; 95% CI: 0.24, 0.97) compared with no livestock exposure. Conclusions: Our results suggest that specific agricultural pesticides, solvents, and chemical fertilizers may increase the risk of RA in women, while exposures involving animal contact may be protective.

Environ Health Perspect 124:1728–1734; http://dx.doi.org/10.1289/EHP129","Humeral morphology has been shown to reflect, in part, habitual manipulative behaviors in humans. Among Central European agricultural populations, long-term social change, increasing task specialization, and technological innovation all had the potential to impact patterns of habitual activity and upper limb asymmetry. However, systematic temporal change in the skeletal morphology of agricultural populations in this region has not been well-characterized. This study investigates diachronic patterns in humeral biomechanical properties and lengths among 174 adult Central European agriculturalists through the first ∼5400 years of farming in the region. Greater asymmetry in biomechanical properties was expected to accompany the introduction of metallurgy, particularly in males, while upper limb loading patterns were expected to be more similar between the Bronze and Iron Ages. Results revealed a divergence in the lateralization of upper limb biomechanical properties by sex between the Early/Middle Neolithic and Early/Middle Bronze Age. Neolithic females had significantly more variable properties than males in both humeri, while Bronze Age female properties became homogeneous and very symmetrical relative to the right-biased lateralization of contemporaneous males. The Bronze Age to Iron Age transition was associated with morphological change among females, with a significant increase in right-biased asymmetry and a concomitant reduction in sexual dimorphism. Relative to biomechanical properties, humeral length variation and asymmetry were low though some significant sexual dimorphism and temporal change was found. It was among females that the lateralization of humeral biomechanical properties, and variation within them, changed most profoundly through time. This suggests that the introduction of the ard and plow, metallurgical innovation, task specialization, and socioeconomic change through ∼5400 years of agriculture impacted upper limb loading in Central European women to a greater extent than men.","Early life conditions play an important role in determining adult body size. In particular, childhood malnutrition and disease can elicit growth delays and affect adult body size if severe or prolonged enough. In the earliest stages of farming, skeletal growth impairment and small adult body size are often documented relative to hunter-gatherer groups, though this pattern is regionally variable. In Central/Southeast Europe, it is unclear how early life stress, growth history, and adult body size were impacted by the introduction of agriculture and ensuing long-term demographic, social, and behavioral change. The current study assesses this impact through the reconstruction and analysis of mean stature, body mass, limb proportion indices, and sexual dimorphism among 407 skeletally mature men and women from foraging and farming populations spanning the Late Mesolithic through Early Medieval periods in Central/Southeast Europe (~7100 calBC to 850 AD). Results document significantly reduced mean stature, body mass, and crural index in Neolithic agriculturalists relative both to Late Mesolithic hunter-gatherer-fishers and to later farming populations. This indication of relative growth impairment in the Neolithic, particularly among women, is supported by existing evidence of high developmental stress, intensive physical activity, and variable access to animal protein in these early agricultural populations. Among subsequent agriculturalists, temporal increases in mean stature, body mass, and crural index were more pronounced among Central European women, driving declines in the magnitude of sexual dimorphism through time. Overall, results suggest that the transition to agriculture in Central/Southeast Europe was challenging for early farming populations, but was followed by gradual amelioration across thousands of years, particularly among Central European women. This sex difference may be indicative, in part, of greater temporal variation in the social status afforded to young girls, in their access to resources during growth, and/or in their health status than was experienced by men.","OBJECTIVE Despite the intensive use of pesticides in agriculture there are few studies assessing the risk of respiratory conditions from this exposure. The study aimed at quantifying the prevalence of respiratory symptoms among farmers and evaluating its relationship with occupational use of pesticides and the prevalence of respiratory symptoms. METHODS A cross-sectional study was conducted among 1,379 farmers from two municipalities of Southern Brazil in 1996. Frequency and type of chemical exposure and pesticide poisoning were recorded for both sexes. All subjects aged 15 years or older with at least 15 weekly hours of agricultural activity were interviewed. An adapted questionnaire developed by the American Thoracic Society was used for the assessment of respiratory symptoms. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was carried out. RESULTS More than half (55%) of interviewees were male. The prevalence of asthma symptoms was 12% and chronic respiratory disease symptoms was 22%. Higher odds ratios for both asthma (OR=1.51; 95% CI: 1.07-2.14) and chronic respiratory disease (OR=1.34; 95% CI 1.00-1.81) symptoms were found in women. Logistic regression analysis identified associations between many forms of exposure to pesticides and increased respiratory symptoms. Occurrence of pesticide poisoning was associated with higher prevalence of asthma symptoms (OR=1.54; 95% CI: 1.04-2.58) and chronic respiratory disease symptoms (OR=1.57; 95% CI: 1.08-2.28). CONCLUSIONS In spite of causality limitations, the study results provide evidence that farming exposure to pesticides is associated with higher prevalence of respiratory symptoms, especially when the exposure is above two days per month.","To the Editor: Ningxia is the smallest provincial autonomous region on the Loess Plateau in central China, with a population of ≈5.5 million persons composed of 35 ethnic and various religious groups. The natural environmental conditions and socioreligious ethnic status in Ningxia, particularly the southern region, are conducive to sheep farming, an important part of the agricultural economy. Both cystic echinococcosis (CE) and alveolar echinococcosis (AE) (1) are endemic in the northwest part of China; high prevalences have been reported in several provinces (1), including Gansu (2,3) and the Xinjiang Uigur Autonomous Region (4). Little information is available about the extent of human echinococcosis in Ningxia; this is the first report of a provincial investigation for both human CE and AE there. We conducted a retrospective survey of clinical records from 7 local county hospitals and 4 other hospitals in Yinchuan to determine the epidemiology of human echinococcosis in southern Ningxia. All surgical and clinical records were checked, and diagnoses were confirmed based on imaging, surgical reports, and histopathologic reports. Data concerning age, sex, domicile, ethnicity, occupation, year of diagnosis, cyst or lesion numbers and anatomical location, type and duration of anthelminthic treatment (if given), and the nature and number of surgeries performed for echinococcosis were recorded for each confirmed CE and AE patient. From 1985 to 2002, a total of 2,216 cases of echinococcosis were recorded, most of which were due to CE (96%). The incidence of combined CE and AE from 1994 to 2001 was 7/100,000 persons for southern Ningxia, compared with 1/100,000 persons for Yinchuan in the north (Table). Human AE cases were reported only from the 3 southern counties of Xiji, Haiyuan, and Guyuan; CE cases occurred throughout Ningxia, with a mixed endemic focus for both human CE and AE in the south. A variable distribution of AE and CE cases from 1994 to 2001 was evident from hospital records. Both AE and CE were recorded in Xiji (6/100,000 persons), Guyuan (5/100,000 persons), and Haiyuan (11/100,000 persons) counties. CE incidences for Tongxin (13/100,000 persons) and Pengyang (5/100,000 persons) were substantially higher than for Longde (0.5/100,000 persons) and Jingyuan (0.15/100,000 persons). This heterogeneous distribution of echinococcosis may reflect different patterns of parasite transmission in different areas of Ningxia. CE and AE incidence (Table) were compared for 1994 and 2001 by chi-square test. Apart from a substantial increase in Haiyuan (p<0.05) and a substantial decrease in Xiji (p<0.05), no other substantial incidence changes were apparent (Table). Table Average incidence of human echinococcosis (AE/CE combined), 1994–2001, and incidence compared for ethnicity (Han/Hui) in southern Ningxia and Yinchuan City* Patients' ages ranged from 1 to 80 years for men and from 3 to 77 years for women (mean age 35.7 years). The patient sex ratio was 0.72 (916 men, 1,268 women), whereas the population sex ratio was 1.05, indicating significant differences in echinococcosis case numbers between men and women (p<0.05). Farm laborers accounted for 66.1% (1,464/2,216) of cases, students 12.4% (275/2,216), workers and self-employed 5.2% (116/2,216), village leaders 4.8% (106/2,216), teachers and housewives 0.9% (21/2,216), butchers 0.2% (4/2,216), and others 0.1%. A comparison of the ethnic composition ratio (5) with an average incidence from 1994 to 2001 showed a substantial difference between the Hui and Han nationalities in Yinchuan, Haiyuan, and Pengyang, and for Ningxia as a whole. No substantial difference was shown in Longde, Tongxin, Guyuan, and Xiji for the 2 ethnic groups by incidence risk ratios with 95% confidence intervals (Table). Radical surgery to remove CE cysts was performed for 83.3% of patients; only 7.3% of patients received combined albendazole or mebendazole chemotherapy pre- and post-surgery. Recurrences of CE cysts that required surgery were high (30%), suggesting inadequate surgical and medical care. Most AE patients received only chemotherapy treatment and were at an advanced stage of infection. The retrospective data of human AE and CE infection rates in the current study suggest that disease transmission was more pronounced 10–15 years earlier. The landscape of woods and scrub cover was greater then, domestic sheep and dog populations were larger, and red fox and rodent species densities were likely higher, providing optimal transmission conditions for both Echinococcus granulosus and E. multilocularis. The incidence data (2001) for human CE and AE are likely underestimated for several reasons. Access to medical treatment for villagers is problematic and many asymptomatic cases (6) would be excluded. An age and sex bias also exists, as generally older persons and women receive most of the limited medical attention. Furthermore, the high surgical costs for treatment (CE and AE), especially in the past 10 years, coupled with poor economic development, preclude access to treatment in many rural communities. Because abdominal ultrasound examinations for CE and AE can identify clinically silent infections (7,8), comprehensive community-based studies are needed to identify asymptomatic or early-stage cases. Our study provides accurate data to determine the true prevalence and incidence of CE and AE, which contributes to better treatment outcomes. These data can help determine the reasons for the heterogeneity of disease distribution in Ningxia to better prepare for future echinococcosis control strategies throughout the region.","BackgroundOn 28 March, 2016, the Ministry of Health received a report on three deaths from an unknown disease characterized by fever, jaundice, and hemorrhage which occurred within a one-month period in the same family in central Uganda. We started an investigation to determine its nature and scope, identify risk factors, and to recommend eventually control measures for future prevention.MethodsWe defined a probable case as onset of unexplained fever plus ≥1 of the following unexplained symptoms: jaundice, unexplained bleeding, or liver function abnormalities. A confirmed case was a probable case with IgM or PCR positivity for yellow fever. We reviewed medical records and conducted active community case-finding. In a case-control study, we compared risk factors between case-patients and asymptomatic control-persons, frequency-matched by age, sex, and village. We used multivariate conditional logistic regression to evaluate risk factors. We also conducted entomological studies and environmental assessments.ResultsFrom February to May, we identified 42 case-persons (35 probable and seven confirmed), of whom 14 (33%) died. The attack rate (AR) was 2.6/100,000 for all affected districts, and highest in Masaka District (AR = 6.0/100,000). Men (AR = 4.0/100,000) were more affected than women (AR = 1.1/100,000) (p = 0.00016). Persons aged 30–39 years (AR = 14/100,000) were the most affected. Only 32 case-patients and 128 controls were used in the case control study. Twenty three case-persons (72%) and 32 control-persons (25%) farmed in swampy areas (ORadj = 7.5; 95%CI = 2.3–24); 20 case-patients (63%) and 32 control-persons (25%) who farmed reported presence of monkeys in agriculture fields (ORadj = 3.1, 95%CI = 1.1–8.6); and 20 case-patients (63%) and 35 control-persons (27%) farmed in forest areas (ORadj = 3.2; 95%CI = 0.93–11). No study participants reported yellow fever vaccination. Sylvatic monkeys and Aedes mosquitoes were identified in the nearby forest areas.ConclusionThis yellow fever outbreak was likely sylvatic and transmitted to a susceptible population probably by mosquito bites during farming in forest and swampy areas. A reactive vaccination campaign was conducted in the affected districts after the outbreak. We recommended introduction of yellow fever vaccine into the routine Uganda National Expanded Program on Immunization and enhanced yellow fever surveillance.","ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION For two decades, various countries have experienced an epidemic of chronic kidney disease unexplainable by traditional causes. Typically a chronic tubulointerstitial nephritis, it predominantly affects young male agricultural workers and has been reported in several countries in Central America, as well as in Sri Lanka, India and Egypt. Recent studies in El Salvador have also reported the disease in male nonagricultural workers and in women, both those working in agriculture and not. Epidemiological information on whether this condition affects pediatric populations is virtually nonexistent. Globally, estimates of chronic kidney disease prevalence in pediatric populations range from 21 to 108 per million population. OBJECTIVE Determine the prevalence of urinary markers of renal damage and of chronic kidney disease in persons aged 300 mg/g) was detected only in girls in Las Brisas, 2.3%. Glomerular hyperfiltration (compared to international norms) was found in all age-sex groups in all three regions. Prevalence of chronic kidney disease was 3.9%—4.1% in girls and 3.6% in boys. The prevalence of chronic renal failure was 0.1%. CONCLUSIONS High prevalence of chronic kidney disease in children and adolescents calls attention to the need for primary prevention from very early ages. This finding in children in areas where chronic kidney disease of uncertain etiology is common in adults is consistent with a contribution of environmental toxins to the epidemic observed in these areas.","Women who work in agriculture may have greater risk of pesticide exposure than men who share this occupation. Despite an increase in the fraction of the agricultural workforce comprised by women, few studies have characterized pesticide exposure in the USA with a focus on among these workers. This pilot study aimed to describe pesticide exposure in a cohort of Latina farmworkers in farming communities in southwestern Idaho. We collected urine samples from 29 Latina farmworkers, which were analyzed for 11 pesticide biomarkers. We evaluated the effect of pesticide spray season on urinary biomarker levels, and explored the effect of self-reported status as a pesticide handler on measured exposures. No significant differences were found between biomarker levels in samples collected during the nonspray and spray seasons. We observed 11 extreme outlying values in samples collected during the pesticide spray season. The most extreme outlying values (MDA: 51.7 ng/mL; 3-PBA: 11.8 ng/mL; trans-DCCA: 23.4 ng/mL; and 2,4-D: 31.1 ng/mL) were all provided during the spray season by women who reported loading, mixing or applying pesticides. These results provide suggestive evidence that Latina farmworkers who handle pesticides during the spray season may be at an increased risk of exposure to organophosphate and pyrethroid insecticides, as well as the herbicide 2,4-D. We recommend that future research into pesticide exposures among farmworkers should include particular focus on this group.","Purpose The Manicaland cohort was established to provide robust scientific data on HIV prevalence and incidence, patterns of sexual risk behaviour and the demographic impact of HIV in a sub-Saharan African population subject to a generalised HIV epidemic. The aims were later broadened to include provision of data on the coverage and effectiveness of national HIV control programmes including antiretroviral therapy (ART). Participants General population open cohort located in 12 sites in Manicaland, east Zimbabwe, representing 4 major socioeconomic strata (small towns, agricultural estates, roadside settlements and subsistence farming areas). 9,109 of 11,453 (79.5%) eligible adults (men 17-54 years; women 15–44 years) were recruited in a phased household census between July 1998 and January 2000. Five rounds of follow-up of the prospective household census and the open cohort were conducted at 2-year or 3-year intervals between July 2001 and November 2013. Follow-up rates among surviving residents ranged between 77.0% (over 3 years) and 96.4% (2 years). Findings to date HIV prevalence was 25.1% at baseline and had a substantial demographic impact with 10-fold higher mortality in HIV-infected adults than in uninfected adults and a reduction in the growth rate in the worst affected areas (towns) from 2.9% to 1.0%pa. HIV infection rates have been highest in young adults with earlier commencement of sexual activity and in those with older sexual partners and larger numbers of lifetime partners. HIV prevalence has since fallen to 15.8% and HIV incidence has also declined from 2.1% (1998-2003) to 0.63% (2009-2013) largely due to reduced sexual risk behaviour. HIV-associated mortality fell substantially after 2009 with increased availability of ART. Future plans We plan to extend the cohort to measure the effects on the epidemic of current and future HIV prevention and treatment programmes. Proposals for access to these data and for collaboration are welcome.","BackgroundEndocrine disrupting chemicals and carcinogens, some of which may not yet have been classified as such, are present in many occupational environments and could increase breast cancer risk. Prior research has identified associations with breast cancer and work in agricultural and industrial settings. The purpose of this study was to further characterize possible links between breast cancer risk and occupation, particularly in farming and manufacturing, as well as to examine the impacts of early agricultural exposures, and exposure effects that are specific to the endocrine receptor status of tumours.Methods1005 breast cancer cases referred by a regional cancer center and 1146 randomly-selected community controls provided detailed data including occupational and reproductive histories. All reported jobs wereindustry- and occupation-coded for the construction of cumulative exposure metrics representing likely exposure to carcinogens and endocrine disruptors. In a frequency-matched case–control design, exposure effects were estimated using conditional logistic regression.ResultsAcross all sectors, women in jobs with potentially high exposures to carcinogens and endocrine disruptors had elevated breast cancer risk (OR = 1.42; 95% CI, 1.18-1.73, for 10 years exposure duration). Specific sectors with elevated risk included: agriculture (OR = 1.36; 95% CI, 1.01-1.82); bars-gambling (OR = 2.28; 95% CI, 0.94-5.53); automotive plastics manufacturing (OR = 2.68; 95% CI, 1.47-4.88), food canning (OR = 2.35; 95% CI, 1.00-5.53), and metalworking (OR = 1.73; 95% CI, 1.02-2.92). Estrogen receptor status of tumors with elevated risk differed by occupational grouping. Premenopausal breast cancer risk was highest for automotive plastics (OR = 4.76; 95% CI, 1.58-14.4) and food canning (OR = 5.70; 95% CI, 1.03-31.5).ConclusionsThese observations support hypotheses linking breast cancer risk and exposures likely to include carcinogens and endocrine disruptors, and demonstrate the value of detailed work histories in environmental and occupational epidemiology.",18.4850352646781,Livestock Health

Using 761 household interviews and 33 focus group discussions (FGDs) with smallholder farmers from six districts, data was collected on how smallholder farmers in the region experience climate change, what CA practices they had adopted, and benefits and challenges associated with CA practice. Results show that men and women farmers had similar experiences of climate change, namely late onset of a shortened rainy season, intra-seasonal drought and higher temperatures. Farmers' perceptions of gender-mediated effects of climate change had important nuances. The three most cited effects of climate change on women mentioned by women were lower crop yields, outbreaks of armyworms and reduced livestock fodder. The men thought women were most affected by increased hunger, lower crop yields and reduced domestic water sources. According to the women FGDs, men were most affected through reduced crop yields, increases in livestock diseases and increased hunger. The men self-reported reduced crop yields, reduced water for livestock and outbreaks of armyworms. Both men and women saw CA as having climate change adaptation benefits. For the women, men most benefitted from CA through the high moisture holding capacity of basins, higher crop yields and reduced labor requirements through use of oxen ripping. The men most appreciated the high crop yields, improved soil fertility and reduced costs as less fertilizer is used. The women cited the high moisture holding capacity of basins, high crop yields and improved soil fertility as benefits they most commonly derived from CA, while the men thought the women most benefitted from CA through the higher crop yields, improved soil fertility and crop tolerance to droughts. The study concludes that there is room for CA to serve as a climate smart agricultural system for both men and women smallholder farmers in Eastern Zambia. However, this will require addressing important challenges of high weed pressure, high labor demands, and low access to manure, and CA farming implements. The CA package for Zambia should include access to timely climate information and climate informed crop choices.","Climate change poses a significant threat to various sectors, including agriculture, affecting men and women unevenly. Although gender-based perceptions of climate change have been studied, there remains a gap in understanding how these perceptions influence the adoption of adaptation strategies among men and women smallholder farmers in the production of leguminous crops in sub-Saharan Africa. This study investigated the gender differences in the adoption of climate change adaptation strategies among bean and cowpea farmers in Ghana. The findings revealed that socioeconomic and institutional factors significantly influenced the choice of adaptation strategies, with notable differences between men and women. Higher levels of education, farming experience, marital status, access to credit, and education determined the choice of adaptation strategies. On the other hand, women farmers, despite having lower levels of formal education, showed a higher utilization of extension services, possibly due to targeted efforts to reach out to more women farmers. Larger households were less likely to adopt mixed cropping and changing cropping patterns, while married individuals were less likely to use crop rotation. Training and access to credit significantly increased the likelihood of adopting crop rotation, changing cropping patterns, and using improved seeds. The study also found that [f]armers perceptions of the impacts of dry spells and delayed onset of rains influenced the use of climate change adaptation strategies. Furthermore, farmers who participated in climate change planning were more likely to use diverse adaptation strategies, underscoring the importance of a locally focused, inclusive planning process. However, gender differences were observed in the determinants of the use of these strategies. For instance, while access to extension services was found to be more influential for women, men’s decisions were more influenced by their marital status, access to credit, and education. Policy makers and local institutions need to encourage and facilitate farmers’ involvement in climate change planning processes to enable designing of effective, context-relevant, inclusive, and sustainable climate change adaptation strategies. Distinct differences in the factors underlying the use of adaptation strategies by men and women demand creation of and implementation of gender-sensitive programs that effectively reach and benefit both women and women.","In many low-income nations agriculture is used as the primary source of income, which in the face of a changing climate, is known to be at considerable risk for the smallholder farmers that rely on it. Financial resources may enable smallholder farmers to implement adaptation practices and diversify income and investments, which has the potential to affect household income and food security. Here we explore relationships between access to different types of financial resources among male and female-headed households and women versus men, use of financial resources, and its relationship to food security. We use data from the CGIAR Climate Change, Agriculture, and Food Security (CCAFS) program from four sites including Nyando (Western Kenya) and Wote (Eastern Kenya), Rakai (Uganda) and Kaffrine (Senegal), to represent major farming systems and agro-ecological zones across Africa. We find that male and female-headed households do not attempt to borrow financial resources in significantly different quantities; however, female-headed households are likely to have access to financial resources if they wanted them. We find that men and male-headed households are more likely to access formal loans. As well, we find that male and female-headed households spend their financial resources differently with female-headed households most likely to use their credit for food, medical expenses and education and male-headed households most likely to use it on food, agriculture/ livestock inputs and education. Formals loans were more frequently associated with credit spent on agriculture/livestock inputs while informal loans were more likely to be utilized for buying food and medical care. We find that all households and sexes that attempted to borrow money were less likely to borrow food and other goods, but that female-headed households were more than twice as likely to borrow food overall. These results add nuance to the relationship of financial resources to food security, suggesting that for many smallholders, especially women, credit is often used to obtain food and other health outcomes as compared to on-farm investment. The use of financial resources for these varying purposes likely has different short-term versus long-term returns and tradeoffs, which could influence smallholder farmer capacity for climate change adaptation.","The adoption and use of climate-smart agricultural practices are critical for improving the productivity and sustainability of smallholder farming systems. However, the gendered dimensions of access to and use of climate-smart agriculture in common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) production remain unexplored among smallholder farmers in Burundi. A mixed methods research design was employed to investigate gender dynamics in common bean production among smallholder common bean farmers in the communes of Kirundo, Bwambarangwe, and Muyinga in Burundi. In addition, how the adoption and use of climate-smart agricultural practices differed by gender in Burundi. A multivariate probit model was employed to evaluate how improved bean seed, pesticide use, irrigation, conservation agriculture and other factors contribute to reducing gender gaps and influencing access to and uptake of climate-smart agriculture. The results revealed existing gender gaps and differences in access to and use of climate-smart agriculture practices, with women being the most vulnerable. Disproportionate experiences of production challenges emerged as critical obstacles to gender equality in bean production. Drought affected women and young farmers more severely than men. Joint decision-making, access to information, and collective action in groups reduced gender gaps in bean production and gender differences in access to and use of climate-smart technologies.","Crop diseases significantly suppress plant yields and in extreme cases wipe out entire crop species threatening food security and eroding rural livelihoods. It is therefore critical to estimate the extent to which shocks like disease epidemics can affect food availability and the capacity of smallholder farmers to mitigate and reverse the effects of such shocks. This study utilizes sex-disaggregated data from 341 households in Uganda to analyze: first, gender and access to agricultural resources and their control; second, whether men and women in the targeted banana-farming communities share similar perceptions toward the effectiveness of the banana Xanthomonas wilt (BXW) control technologies and their respective information dissemination pathways; third, whether gender and farmer perceptions influence  on farm adoption of BXW management practices. Lastly, it determines the impact of adoption of BXW control practices on food security. Results show that whereas most household assets are jointly owned, men have more individual ownership, control, and decision-making on income from household assets than women. Perceptions on effectiveness of BXW control practices and communication channels also differed between men and women. Men rated cutting down of infected plants to be more effective than women, but tissue culture, removal of male buds and disinfecting of farm tools were perceived to be equally effective by both men and women. In addition, apart from newspapers which were more effective in delivering BXW information to men, we found no differences in the effectiveness of other BXW information sources. More importantly, the study finds both gender and farmer perceptions on BXW control to significantly affect adoption of BXW control practices and household food security. For better and sustainable management of plant epidemics in Uganda, it is therefore critical that existing gender-based and underlying perception constraints are addressed.   Key words: Gender-based constraints, food security, perceptions, technology adoption, Xanthomonas wilt.","In many East African countries, women and men have different levels of access to formal markets for agricultural inputs, including seed, reflecting a combination of gender norms and resource constraints. As a result, women and men may have different levels of participation in—and reliance upon—informal seed systems for sourcing preferred planting material and accessing new crop varieties over time. We use network analysis to explore differences in seed networks accessed by women and men for three major food security crops—beans, finger millet, and sorghum—in Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda. Drawing on data from an original survey of 1001 rural farm households across five study sites, we find that women, on average, have fewer connections to experts and farmers’ groups than men but are relatively better connected in farmer-to-farmer social networks across different farming systems. We further find women’s and men’s networks are clustered by gender (i.e., women’s networks include more women, and men’s networks include more men)—and that men’s networks are more likely to exchange improved seed. Women’s networks, though sometimes larger, are less likely to exchange improved varieties that might help farmers adapt to climate change. Women farmers across contexts may also be more reliant on farmer-to-farmer networks than men due to their relative isolation from other seed and information sources. Findings emphasize the need for careful attention to the different implications of seed policies, market interventions, and other seed system reforms to support gender-equitable food security options for women and men in sub-Saharan Africa.","This study explored the effectiveness of video as a tool to either complement or replace existing lecturedemonstration training for small farmer groups. The effectiveness of video in decreasing the knowledge gap among farmers who differ by gender was also evaluated. Quantitative and qualitative data were gathered through a quasi-experiment including a pretest and a posttest design with three experimental groups. Results showed that video could be an effective complement and replacement for the traditional lecturedemonstration training method. Video alone or video plus traditional lecture-demonstration was as effective as traditional training in increasing learning. The training method that included both video and traditional lecture-demonstration was especially effective for groups with relatively low prior knowledge of the training topic. However, video only was not as effective as traditional training or traditional training plus video in decreasing gaps in learning between men and women. Video has advantages in rural areas because it does not require face-to-face presentation by skilled trainers. Video might be an attractive alternative or supplement if the production cost is low enough, or if traditional lecture-demonstration cannot meet the demand for training. Using local actors, shooting video in the local environment and using local languages add to video’s advantages for training purposes. When used to demonstrate a farming technique or practice in a group setting, videos were found to enhance interaction (e.g. discussion and peer learning) among farmers.","ABSTRACT Purpose This study explores the intersection of gender and place with agricultural extension services to understand disparities in resource and information access and build community resilience in post-conflict Liberia. It emphasizes how such intersections may be further compounded by climate change and provides possible solutions. Methodology Using a community-based research approach, 352 surveys and 44 focus groups were conducted in 22 communities in 3 counties in north-central Liberia. Subsequently, qualitative, quantitative, and spatial analyses were done to explore gender and place-based differences in farmer access to agricultural resources and household agency. Findings Study results show that women farmers have less access to technology, agricultural resources and information; higher, combined productive and domestic, labor burdens; and that farmers of both genders want more female extension officers. Practical Implications This study provides critical data to help effectively target limited expenditures on national extension services to smallholder farmers in post-conflict settings. Further, solutions for practitioners to adaptively mitigate farming challenges enhanced by climate change. Theoretical Implications Studying the intersection among gender, rural isolation and diminished capacity in post-conflict countries will enhance understanding of (extension service) capacity in settings with multiple drivers affecting gender inequalities. Originality Improve the overall understanding of how compounding factors such as gender and place effect extension service access and the ability of farmers to adapt to change, in Liberia and other post-conflict settings.","Purpose This study aims to investigate risks associated with climate change vulnerability and in response the adaptation methods used by farming communities to reduce its negative impacts on agriculture in Pakistan. Design/methodology/approach The study used the household survey method of to collect data collected in Charsadda district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, involving 116 randomly selected respondents. Findings Prevalent crops diseases, water scarcity, soil fertility loss and poor socio-economic conditions were main contributing factors of climate change vulnerability. The results further showed that changing crops type and cultivation pattern, improved seed varieties, planting shaded trees and the provision of excessive fertilizers are the measures adapted to improve agricultural productivity, which may reduce the climate change vulnerability at a household level. Research limitations/implications The major limitation of this study was the exclusion of women from the survey due to religious and cultural barriers of in Pashtun society, wherein women and men do not mingle. Practical implications Reducing climate change vulnerability and developing more effective adaptation techniques require assistance from the government. This help can be in the form of providing basic resources, such as access to good quality agricultural inputs, access to information and extension services on climate change adaptation and modern technologies. Consultation with other key stakeholder is also required to create awareness and to build the capacity of the locals toward reducing climate change vulnerability and facilitating timely and effective adaptation. Originality/value This original research work provides evidence about farm-level vulnerability, adaptation strategies and risk perceptions on dealing with climate-change-induced natural disasters in Pakistan. This paper enriches existing knowledge of climate change vulnerability and adaptation in this resource-limited country so that effective measures can be taken to reduce vulnerability of farming communities, and enhance their adaptive capability.","Much is known about the effects of climate change on women, and most research on the topic focuses on women’s greater vulnerability as a result of their reliance on natural resources, lower access to resources and information, and gender and social norms which inhibit their ability to take action and participate in making household and community decisions. Less attention is given to women’s active role as agents of change, their knowledge and capacity to respond to climate impacts, or tackling of the causes of vulnerability (Dankelman 2010; MacGregor 2010; Perez et al. 2015; Huyer et al. 2015). In the area of agricultural climate adaptation, Davidson (2016) noted that research on gender has primarily focused on barriers to adaptation for women to date, finding that women-headed farming households tend to be more vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, and women in all types of households are relatively more vulnerable as well. Women farmers are less likely to adopt adaptation strategies due to financial and resource limitations and less control over land (see Jost et al. 2016; Climatic Change https://doi.org/10.1007/s10584-019-02612-5",17.2558481935687,Climate Adaptation Finance

This country is endowed with a cattle population of 21.3 M, composed mainly of indigenous Zebu breeds and about 680 000 improved dairy animals. About 70% of the milk produced comes from the traditional sector (indigenous cattle) kept in rural areas, while the remaining 30% comes from improved cattle, mainly kept by smallholder producers. In Northern Tanzania and particularly in Hai district of Kilimanjaro Region, some dairy farmers organize themselves into small producer groups for the purpose of milk collecting, marketing and general promotion of the dairy sector in their community. Nronga Women Dairy Cooperative Society (NWDCS) Limited is one of such organizations dedicated to improve the well-being of the Nronga village community through promoting small-scale dairy farming and its flow-on benefits. Milk flows out of the village, and services for investment and dairy production flow into the village, ensuring a sustainable financial circulation necessary for poverty reduction, rural development and better life for the rural community. In 2001 NWDCS introduced a school milk feeding program that has attracted Australian donors since 2005. Guided by Global Development Group, a multi-faceted project, integrating micro-enterprises, business, education and child health/nutrition, was proposed and initiated by building a dairy plant in Hai District headquarters, the Boma plant. In March 2013, the Australian High Commission to East Africa approved Direct Aid Program funding of AUD 30 000 towards the NWDCS - Biogas Pilot Project in Tanzania, which included the renovation of zero-grazing cow shade units, the construction of 6-m 3 biodigester plants on each farm, and encouragement of the use of bioslurry for pasture production and home gardens.","Smallholder farming can play a crucial role in contributing to food supplies and autonomy at the household and community level in rural areas, yet this has been challenging to evaluate. In South Africa, smallholder agriculture faces multiple challenges due to historical injustices regarding access to land and resources and to post-apartheid policies that failed to promote rural development. Drawing on the Sustainable Livelihoods Framework and employing a mixed methods approach, we explore through participant observation and interviews the prospects of smallholder agricultural programs for establishing sustainable livelihoods, facilitated by civil society organizations and targeted at rural black and colored South African women. Participation in these programs enabled women access to various livelihoods assets: education and capacity-building (human assets); land (natural assets); tools and infrastructure (physical assets); stipends and income from selling their produce (financial assets); and networking (social assets). Operational challenges included divergent expectations on the side of project facilitators and participants; lack of communication; participant dependency on the organizations; lack of access to markets; and programs' lack of financial sustainability. Our findings suggest that, while these programs are not yet sustainable, they stimulate an awareness of possibilities, visions, ownership, and rights that can have a long-term effect on the livelihoods of these women. In evaluating program success, especially in the initiation phases, it must be remembered that structural barriers to the improvement of rural women's livelihoods are formidable, and few South African models or alternatives are presently available to help civil society organizations formulate new opportunities.","Rural women need to diversify their occupations since farming in sub - Saharan Africa is rain - fed and , therefore , seasonal. This is to enable them to acquire additional income to take care of economic responsibilities during off - season periods. This paper reviews current literature in the field in both farm and non - farm occupations and effects of occupational diversification, which varies from negative to positive effects . One major negative effect is withdrawal of critical labour from the family farm which serves as a distress push factor while t he positive effects include raisin g agricultural household income which is also referred to as dem and pull factor. The paper also discusses government initiated programmes aimed at reducing poverty, vulnerability and targeted to wards economic empowerment of rural women in Nigeria such as Bette r Life Programme (BLP), Family S upport Programme (FSP), Agricultural Development Programme (ADP), Family Economic A dvancement Programme (FEAP), National Special Programme on Food Security (NSPFS) and Family Economic Advancement Programme (FEAP). Worthy of note is that some of these programmes have failed to achieve the aims of their establishment , mainly because most of these government initiated programmes were highly politicised to the detriment of the beneficiaries. This left rural women with the option of involvement in diversification of occupations. This is t o enable them generate additional income to empower themselves economically to me et their family obligations thus reducing vulnerability and poverty among members of their households. Occupational diversification is of increasing importance for women ’s economic empowerment. This paper asserts that the contribution made by occupational diversification to rural livelihoods is a significant one that has often been ignored by policy makers who choose to focus on agriculture. The paper recommends the need for government policies and programmes to promote the development of human capital among the rural women to equip them with the necessary skills to work in non - farm activities","India is popularly known as an agriculture driven nation, since the majority of its population is employed in agriculture, thus, making agriculture backbone of the Indian economy. Agriculture is an engine of growth and poverty reduction in the majority of developing nations. Strengthening rural people, directly and indirectly, contributes to nations’ development. As in India, the rural population mostly comprises of marginal and landless farmers, there is a need for a low cost and maximum profit plan to enhance both their income as well as socio-economic status. One such plan is to set up a small-scale mushroom production unit which requires by-products of the agricultural farm as input and occupy less agricultural land space. Mushroom cultivation is a minimum input maximum output venture proving to be an additional source of income. The vegetarian population residing in the urban areas of our country has now accepted mushrooms in their diet because of its nutritional Review Article Dey et al.; CJAST, 39(2): 38-46, 2020; Article no.CJAST.54661 39 values so the mushroom produced from the nearby rural areas has a good market of selling their products easily and at a good price. Thus, the mushroom is a boon to both producer and consumer giving it the status of superfood. Mushroom cultivation can also be a way to empower the rural women, provide additional income for the sustenance of farming families and tackle the problem of lack of nutritional requirement of the rural people. Rural women are the most productive workforce in the economy, raising the need to strengthen and improve their socio-economic status. A low-cost small-scale mushroom production unit can generate income through the sale of spawns, in addition to the sale of fresh mushroom in a sustainable approach by utilizing farm by-products as their raw material.","The paper outlines the positive contributions of organic agriculture in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). It draws upon empirical evidence from a series of studies financed by the Asian Development Bank Institute in 2005–2006 showing the benefits of organic agricultural practices and contract farming of organic agriculture products in selected Asian countries. The case studies showed that organic agriculture helped lead these countries toward the path of achieving their respective development goals, particularly the Millennium Development Goals, by 2015. The positive impacts of organic agriculture on health, incomes, and the environment are facilitated by its own well defined standards and market-based certification systems which ensure premium prices for organic producers. This has helped achieve high consumer awareness of its benefits and increased consumer demand both in developed and developing countries. Most importantly, organic agriculture fosters gender equality as it creates meaningful work (diverse tasks). It offers economic opportunities (low costs); promotes health (no synthetic chemicals); encourages biodiversity and traditional knowledge (retention of traditional seeds and farming practices); and ensures equitable work standards (equal wages and opportunities). This is particularly true for farmers, especially women, in small farming communities. Beyond 2015, the commitment of governments to fight for a sustainable and poverty-free world continues in the SDGs. This makes organic agriculture a crucial development strategy in the SDGs era.","ISSN: 2319-7706 Volume 8 Number 05 (2019) Journal homepage: http://www.ijcmas.com For the development of any nation, the females play a significant role. In India, the females comprise 48.18% of the total population. The majority of Indian females reside in the rural areas of our country. The female population of the rural India is the backbone of the rural economy and major drivers in the agriculture sector. They play an important role in poultry farming, goat farming, apiculture and sericulture. The traits required for the workers in the agriculture sectors are inherent in the Indian female population. The qualities of hardwork, concentration, courage, devotion and dedication are ingrained in the women folk of India. Therefore, the agriculture related work is easily done by women. In the sericulture sector, women form a major working force. Sericulture being one of the most important cottage industries can provide employment for the Indian women. It is a labour intensive agro industry and can provide livelihood support to the unemployed rural women. Sericulture can also be taken up as an additional source of income for the people employed in other sectors. It needs low capital investment and greater return. The management and look after is also very simple and less time consuming. It utilizes little space hence, it can provide employment not only to the agriculturists but, also to the landless people and the labourers. Sericulture is the conscious mass-scale rearing of silk producing organisms to obtain silk. It is intensively practiced in the rural areas of Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, Assam, West Bengal, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu; where it creates gainful employment opportunities. It improves the economic conditions of the poor and the small area farmers along with poverty alleviation. In India, women have played and continue to play a crucial role in development of agriculture and allied fields. Unfortunately, the economic condition of women in rural India is critical because they don‘t have proper work in their hand. It is the best occupation for women in the changing scenario of their family income. Thus, it is possible to empower women through the development of the sericulture industry. The women participate at a higher rate in activities relating to silkworm rearing, cocoon harvesting, marketing and spinning of the spun yarn. Besides, their involvement is again higher against men in marketing of pupae and cocoon. The similar trend of participation of women is seen in case of mulberry sericulture. It is possible to achieve women empowerment through sericulture industry. The lack of separate rearing house, adequate plantation, improved technological knowledge and times have been major constraint in participation of women in sericulture. As the woman contribute significantly in socio-economic development of rural sector through sericulture, they need to be financially and technologically supported. The development of the sericulture industry and the empowerment of the rural women in India are correlated. K e y w o r d s","Forests cover only 6 to 8 percent of the total land area of Bangladesh. While agricultural expansion continues to massively deplete the natural forests, a well-managed homegarden practice is vital for reversing the existing trend and promoting the ecological balance of the country. An understanding of the role of women in homegarden management within a traditional farming system is important in expanding and improving the practice. This paper seeks to explore the participation of women in homegarden management activities, understanding the impact of homegardens on women's income and livelihoods and assessing women's awareness of homegarden-oriented activities that support forest conservation. The study demonstrates a number of important conclusions: (1) women are mostly involved in homegarden management-related activities (2) women are interested in conserving homegardens because they obtain such substantial benefits as food security, income, health care, and environmental benefits (3) women were found to be aware of home-garden conservation and tuned to motivating husbands, children, and neighbors to conserve the agro-biodiversity of homegardens. Findings suggest that increased involvement of women in a broad range of homegarden management activities is not only beneficial for their own socio-economic well-being, but also imperative for sustaining the livelihoods of their communities and for preserving the agro-biodiversity in homegardens.","Abstract In this article I underscore how women organic tea farmers build economic resilience through dual enactments as ""organic farmers"" and as ""entrepreneurs."" In substantiating both, women question the limited optics through which Fair Trade type sustainability ventures measure their work for a tea cooperative, as well poorly recognizing their entrepreneurial work in their households and community. Women are deeply aware of the politics of Fair Trade where their productive and reproductive labor is appropriated through the labor of organics, where women not only produce the organic green leaf tea but also produce narratives of Fair Trade's success in its certification and gender audits. Thus, to understand what sustains the new wave of ""sustainable agriculture"" in the global South, we must explore the intersections of organic farming practices with emerging discourses and practices of gendered entrepreneurialism in organic farming communities. In Darjeeling, India, women provide the labor necessary to sustain organics that should ideally come from the Indian state or international trading partners. They fill the gap through their labor, time, creativity and risk-taking. I contend that the success of organic farming depends on critical maneuvers that entail economic and cultural entrepreneurialism, and demonstrate forms of resilience expressed through which women farmers identify and navigate the inadequacies of alternative agriculture and related Fair Trade practices. Keywords: Women organic tea farmers, women entrepreneurs, Fair Trade, rural Darjeeling, risk-taking, resilience","The means by which women in rural communities gain income and meet basic needs are often met by multiple livelihood activities (Ayodepo, 2010). These activities can be termed the informal economic activities, and it serves as the most important source of employment in rural Nigeria. The sector is equally essential as it provides an opportunity for a large majority of rural population for selfactualization, self reliance and fulfillment (International Labour Organisation, 1990). The increasing detachment of women and children from men’s income has led to an increase in the involvement of rural women in informal economic activities, hence according to Odejimi and Agbada (2014), the informal sector habours the highest number of active poor, who are small business owners that need financial assistance to sustain and develop their businesses. Rural women entrepreneurs by virtue of their location and level of education may have good business ideas but lack money to profitably use those ideas. Rural women activities mainly include petty trading, vocational enterprises, handicraft, farming and agro-processing (Onyenechere, 2011). Most low income women have important productive role in the family and also in the society. They are also involved in producing agricultural raw materials for our industries. In fact, most agricultural production and marketing activities including animal husbandry activities are performed by women.","The fastest growing demographic sectors of Washington agriculture are Latino, Asian, and women farmers. The majority of these farms are small, with over three-fourths of Latino, Hmong, or women-operated farms having fewer than 50 acres and less than $50,000 in sales. Small farms make up 90 percent of all Washington farms, with 35,269 counted in the last census. Unfortunately, most conventional farming education models are not well-suited to farmers with limited access to land, water, and capital, or with limited literacy or limited English proficiency. Meeting the needs of this new generation of farmers will require rethinking many standard approaches to public agricultural research, education, and assistance. This article examines various alternative formats for reaching diverse producers with sustainable farming education that have been piloted by the Washington State University Small Farms Program, including participatory courses, farmer-to-farmer learning strategies, experiential workshops, audio­visual strategies, and simultaneous translation.",24.3571979943401,Farm Income Stabilization
