Using 761 household interviews and 33 focus group discussions (FGDs) with smallholder farmers from six districts, data was collected on how smallholder farmers in the region experience climate change, what CA practices they had adopted, and benefits and challenges associated with CA practice. Results show that men and women farmers had similar experiences of climate change, namely late onset of a shortened rainy season, intra-seasonal drought and higher temperatures. Farmers' perceptions of gender-mediated effects of climate change had important nuances. The three most cited effects of climate change on women mentioned by women were lower crop yields, outbreaks of armyworms and reduced livestock fodder. The men thought women were most affected by increased hunger, lower crop yields and reduced domestic water sources. According to the women FGDs, men were most affected through reduced crop yields, increases in livestock diseases and increased hunger. The men self-reported reduced crop yields, reduced water for livestock and outbreaks of armyworms. Both men and women saw CA as having climate change adaptation benefits. For the women, men most benefitted from CA through the high moisture holding capacity of basins, higher crop yields and reduced labor requirements through use of oxen ripping. The men most appreciated the high crop yields, improved soil fertility and reduced costs as less fertilizer is used. The women cited the high moisture holding capacity of basins, high crop yields and improved soil fertility as benefits they most commonly derived from CA, while the men thought the women most benefitted from CA through the higher crop yields, improved soil fertility and crop tolerance to droughts. The study concludes that there is room for CA to serve as a climate smart agricultural system for both men and women smallholder farmers in Eastern Zambia. However, this will require addressing important challenges of high weed pressure, high labor demands, and low access to manure, and CA farming implements. The CA package for Zambia should include access to timely climate information and climate informed crop choices.","Climate change poses a significant threat to various sectors, including agriculture, affecting men and women unevenly. Although gender-based perceptions of climate change have been studied, there remains a gap in understanding how these perceptions influence the adoption of adaptation strategies among men and women smallholder farmers in the production of leguminous crops in sub-Saharan Africa. This study investigated the gender differences in the adoption of climate change adaptation strategies among bean and cowpea farmers in Ghana. The findings revealed that socioeconomic and institutional factors significantly influenced the choice of adaptation strategies, with notable differences between men and women. Higher levels of education, farming experience, marital status, access to credit, and education determined the choice of adaptation strategies. On the other hand, women farmers, despite having lower levels of formal education, showed a higher utilization of extension services, possibly due to targeted efforts to reach out to more women farmers. Larger households were less likely to adopt mixed cropping and changing cropping patterns, while married individuals were less likely to use crop rotation. Training and access to credit significantly increased the likelihood of adopting crop rotation, changing cropping patterns, and using improved seeds. The study also found that [f]armers perceptions of the impacts of dry spells and delayed onset of rains influenced the use of climate change adaptation strategies. Furthermore, farmers who participated in climate change planning were more likely to use diverse adaptation strategies, underscoring the importance of a locally focused, inclusive planning process. However, gender differences were observed in the determinants of the use of these strategies. For instance, while access to extension services was found to be more influential for women, men’s decisions were more influenced by their marital status, access to credit, and education. Policy makers and local institutions need to encourage and facilitate farmers’ involvement in climate change planning processes to enable designing of effective, context-relevant, inclusive, and sustainable climate change adaptation strategies. Distinct differences in the factors underlying the use of adaptation strategies by men and women demand creation of and implementation of gender-sensitive programs that effectively reach and benefit both women and women.","Agriculture is amongst the vulnerable sectors to climate change and its associated impacts. Most women are more vulnerable to the impacts of climate change than men. Climate Smart Agriculture ensures increased productivity thereby enabling food security, income security and wealth creation amongst the farming households. A study was carried out to understand the gender differences in access and use of climate-smart agriculture, challenges and solutions that men and women farmers use to adapt to climate change. Data was collected from 246 randomly sampled households from 14 villages at Linthipe Extension Planning in Dedza district in Malawi. The multivariate probit model was employed to understand the influence of sociodemographic, farm-level, and institutional factors in the application of climate-smart agriculture in the study area. Findings from this study indicate that there are differences in the adoption and use of climate-smart agriculture technologies in bean production amongst different gender categories. More women compared to men and youths tend to use fertilizer, use improved seeds and plant early in order to mitigate and adapt to climate change. Most men adopt and use irrigation, whilst the youth mostly adopted and used pesticides and conservation agriculture practices. The study recommends policies that would ensure the promotion of gender-responsive climate-smart agriculture technologies, improved access to inputs, and capacity building through training.","The adoption and use of climate-smart agricultural practices are critical for improving the productivity and sustainability of smallholder farming systems. However, the gendered dimensions of access to and use of climate-smart agriculture in common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) production remain unexplored among smallholder farmers in Burundi. A mixed methods research design was employed to investigate gender dynamics in common bean production among smallholder common bean farmers in the communes of Kirundo, Bwambarangwe, and Muyinga in Burundi. In addition, how the adoption and use of climate-smart agricultural practices differed by gender in Burundi. A multivariate probit model was employed to evaluate how improved bean seed, pesticide use, irrigation, conservation agriculture and other factors contribute to reducing gender gaps and influencing access to and uptake of climate-smart agriculture. The results revealed existing gender gaps and differences in access to and use of climate-smart agriculture practices, with women being the most vulnerable. Disproportionate experiences of production challenges emerged as critical obstacles to gender equality in bean production. Drought affected women and young farmers more severely than men. Joint decision-making, access to information, and collective action in groups reduced gender gaps in bean production and gender differences in access to and use of climate-smart technologies.","In many low-income nations agriculture is used as the primary source of income, which in the face of a changing climate, is known to be at considerable risk for the smallholder farmers that rely on it. Financial resources may enable smallholder farmers to implement adaptation practices and diversify income and investments, which has the potential to affect household income and food security. Here we explore relationships between access to different types of financial resources among male and female-headed households and women versus men, use of financial resources, and its relationship to food security. We use data from the CGIAR Climate Change, Agriculture, and Food Security (CCAFS) program from four sites including Nyando (Western Kenya) and Wote (Eastern Kenya), Rakai (Uganda) and Kaffrine (Senegal), to represent major farming systems and agro-ecological zones across Africa. We find that male and female-headed households do not attempt to borrow financial resources in significantly different quantities; however, female-headed households are likely to have access to financial resources if they wanted them. We find that men and male-headed households are more likely to access formal loans. As well, we find that male and female-headed households spend their financial resources differently with female-headed households most likely to use their credit for food, medical expenses and education and male-headed households most likely to use it on food, agriculture/ livestock inputs and education. Formals loans were more frequently associated with credit spent on agriculture/livestock inputs while informal loans were more likely to be utilized for buying food and medical care. We find that all households and sexes that attempted to borrow money were less likely to borrow food and other goods, but that female-headed households were more than twice as likely to borrow food overall. These results add nuance to the relationship of financial resources to food security, suggesting that for many smallholders, especially women, credit is often used to obtain food and other health outcomes as compared to on-farm investment. The use of financial resources for these varying purposes likely has different short-term versus long-term returns and tradeoffs, which could influence smallholder farmer capacity for climate change adaptation.","Enhancing profit efficiency in vegetable farming is important to increase income, livelihoods, and nutrition security, and to reduce poverty of smallholder farmers, particularly in developing countries. This study examined the profit efficiency and its determinants in smallholder vegetable farms in Nepal using the stochastic translog profit function with cross-section data collected in 2013. The results revealed a high level of inefficiency in vegetable farms because of the combined effects of technical, allocative, and scale inefficiencies. The profitability differential in vegetable farms is significantly explained by input variables, namely, labor, land, seeds, fertilizer, pesticides, and capital. The determinants of profit inefficiency in vegetable farming were the types of crop varieties, access to information and extension services, access to agricultural credit, distance of farms to markets, and sex of farm manager. The profit efficiency in vegetable farming can be enhanced by adopting improved seed varieties, improving effective information and extension programs, increasing accessibility of credit facilities to the farmers, developing market infrastructure, and empowering women farmers in vegetable farming that leads to improve household income and nutrition security.","While the commercialization and diversification of agricultural and livestock systems have been identified as key global strategies for climate change adaptation and mitigation, less is known as to the large-scale gendered impacts that are implicated in these transformations among smallholder crop and livestock farmers. This study explores these gender impacts across different farming systems and gender-respondent-household typologies using data from the Rural Household Multiple Indicator Survey (RHoMIS) in 2,859 households in three East African countries – Ethiopia, Kenya, and Tanzania. Female control scores over incomes or foodstuffs produced through both on and off farm activities were highest in farming systems that had more land and more livestock. However, increasing commercialization – defined herein as the increasing importance of crop and livestock sales to farm households – resulted in an overall decline in female control across all farming systems and gender-respondent-household typologies. In contrast, crop and livestock diversification were positively associated with female control across gender-respondent-household typologies. Analysis of specific crops and livestock products across farming systems and respondent typologies revealed women have far greater control over decisions related to consumption than decisions related to sales, although the gap between the two were less pronounced in lesser-valued livestock products (chickens, eggs). However, the analyses suggest that as sale of crops and livestock increase, female control over these areas could likely diminish, regardless of specific activity. The authors conclude that approaches to adapt to or mitigate climate change that rely on increasing market orientation of smallholder production will likely intensify men’s control over benefits from production, whereas diversification will likely have a more positive impact on female control. Thus, climate adaptation strategies promoting increased diversification will likely have a more positive impact on women smallholders than commercialization alone. The authors recommend that when commercialization is the target intervention, it must be accompanied by a gender differentiated analysis of trade-offs and risks to mitigate the potential negative consequences shown in this study.","The COVID-19 pandemic has had immediate and cascading impacts on global agricultural systems. In Senegal, the immediate impacts include inaccessibility of inputs due to disruption in markets and supply chains, availability of labor, and changes in crop and livestock management practices. To understand the range of impacts on the biophysical and socioeconomic dimensions of smallholder farming systems, a survey was designed to identify the risk factors, assess the impacts, and explore appropriate mitigation strategies. The survey was administered to 917 smallholder farmers in 14 regions of Senegal in collaboration with a national farmer’s organization and the Senegalese Institute of Agricultural Research (ISRA). The sample was comprised of farmers (men and women) and was stratified in each region to ensure representation from all agroecological zones of the country. The survey examined variables such as access to inputs, ability to plant, impacts on yields, markets, labor, the gendered division of labor, food security, and community well-being. The survey response indicated that 77.7% of respondents experienced a reduction in access to inputs, 70.3% experienced a reduction in ability to plant crops during the planting season, 57.1% experienced a reduction in ability to rent farm machinery, and 69.2% reported a reduction in yields. Similar findings were observed for labor, market conditions, and adaptation measures to reduce the impacts on farming systems and household livelihoods. This study advances the research on characterizing risk factors, assessing the impacts, and designing mitigation strategies for strengthening smallholder farming systems resilience to future shocks.","Gender-specific perceptions and needs are critical to better understanding climate change adaptation capacities of local smallholder communities in Africa and elsewhere. As many rural agricultural practices are heavily impacted by male-centered traditional customs and mores, gender dimensions can determine the level of success for policy interventions. To better understand how and what gender dimensions can be important factors for farmer’s climate change adaptations, this study attempts to examine smallholder farmers’ adaptation needs and perspectives in Ghana’s Upper East Region. A focus group discussion and a questionnaire survey were conducted among 200 smallholder farmers. We found that the female respondents, who mostly belonged to low/middle-income groups, emphasized their urgent need for financial support to improve their income. They needed more farmland as 94% of them had only less than 5 acres to farm. In addition, 91% of the female respondents expressed the importance of being connected to farmers’ mutual-help groups to share information about common farming needs. We also found gender-specific needs for extension services, farm inputs, climate information, mechanization, and infrastructure. Regarding access to resources, the women respondents had little interest in investing more in farming as the land they borrowed could be taken away by male owners. The study recommends the need for gender-specific support initiatives that prioritize social protection and gender equality.","ABSTRACT Purpose This study explores the intersection of gender and place with agricultural extension services to understand disparities in resource and information access and build community resilience in post-conflict Liberia. It emphasizes how such intersections may be further compounded by climate change and provides possible solutions. Methodology Using a community-based research approach, 352 surveys and 44 focus groups were conducted in 22 communities in 3 counties in north-central Liberia. Subsequently, qualitative, quantitative, and spatial analyses were done to explore gender and place-based differences in farmer access to agricultural resources and household agency. Findings Study results show that women farmers have less access to technology, agricultural resources and information; higher, combined productive and domestic, labor burdens; and that farmers of both genders want more female extension officers. Practical Implications This study provides critical data to help effectively target limited expenditures on national extension services to smallholder farmers in post-conflict settings. Further, solutions for practitioners to adaptively mitigate farming challenges enhanced by climate change. Theoretical Implications Studying the intersection among gender, rural isolation and diminished capacity in post-conflict countries will enhance understanding of (extension service) capacity in settings with multiple drivers affecting gender inequalities. Originality Improve the overall understanding of how compounding factors such as gender and place effect extension service access and the ability of farmers to adapt to change, in Liberia and other post-conflict settings.",20.3200989217749,Women in Agriculture

A total of 120 cassava farmers comprising 60 men and 60 women were randomly selected. Data were collected with a structured questionnaire and analyzed using descriptive statistics, multiple regression and Z–test. Results show that the men had mean age of 44.5 years and 47 years for the women, majority 93.3% (men) and 81.6% (women) were married, most 61.6% (men) and 51.7% (women) attended secondary school and had mean farming experience of 14.9 years (men) and 12.7 years (women). The major sources of information on cassava production activities used by the farmers were Agricultural Development Programme (ADP) and fellow farmers. Results further showed that women were more involved (  x  = 2.0) than the male cassava farmers (  x  =1.8) in cassava production activities. The factors that influenced the men’s involvement in cassava production activities were household size, farm income and farm size whereas marital status, farming experience and education were the major factors that influenced women’s participation in the process. Meanwhile, there was a significant difference in the level of involvement of the men and women farmers in cassava production activities at 1.0% level of probability. The study concludes that women are more involved in cassava production activities than men. This study therefore recommends formulation of gender sensitive policies, land reforms, free and affordable education for women farmers for enhanced cassava production.

Agriculture comprises of a number of farming activities, where both men and women are involved in multiple diverse nature of field operations. Inspite of their high contribution in farm and non-farm activities, there exist gender disparity with reference to agricultural extension, education and other farm advisory services. The study was conducted in district Sargodha located in the central Punjab, Pakistan. Personal inter-views were conducted from male head as well as spouses of each selected farm family. The total sample size of the study was 300 (150 male and 150 female spouses). A designed structured questionnaire was prepared for the data collection as the research instrument. The data thus collected were coded on SPSS for analysis and interpretation. Results showed that there is significant difference in age and educational status of male heads and their spouses. Majority of the farm families (39.3%) earn income for their livelihoods both from farming and non-farming sources. Intensity of participation of female respondents in different crops and livestock activities was comparatively high as compared to their male counterparts. It was found that average daily share of female in crops related activities was 42% and in livestock activities was 53%. Inspite of their participation in crops and livestock activities it was found that compared to female respondents, male family heads had access to agricultural extension/advisory and agricultural information services and credit facilities. This is due to the existing social, cultural and religious norms in the society of Pakistan. The results of the t-test statistics showed that there is highly significant difference in opinion of male family heads and their spouses (female respondents) regarding barriers to gender equality in agricultural extension in Pakistan","This study assessed domestic violence among women in Ogun State. Data were collected using structured interview guide. Purposively sampling technique was used to select 220 respondents in two zones of Ogun State Agricultural Development Programme. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, Pearson Product Moment Correlation (PPMC). Findings showed that the mean age of respondents was 48.73 years, while the mean household size was 6 persons. Also, 41% of the respondents were Christians. Few, (26.20%) of the respondents had primary education qualification while 30.80% were into farming. Only 43.60% of the respondents belonged to cooperative societies. 18% of the respondents experienced verbal abuse. Similarly, 49.23% of the respondents agreed that domineering attitude of men promote domestic violence. The most preferred coping strategies to ameliorate domestic violence was to remain silent (63.10%). Correlation analysis also showed significant relationship between women’s livelihood activities and coping strategies such as fighting back (r= 0.95), pleasing and placating the perpetrator (r= 0.82), remaining silent (r= 0.89), avoiding the perpetrator (r =0.81) at p < 0.05. It was concluded that domestic violence limits women’s potentials and hinders their full involvement in livelihood activities. Therefore, there is need for the patriarch structures that reinforce power imbalance between men and women to be dismantled. Furthermore, women should be empowered through training and access to social assets such as loans and credit.","1 Department of Agricultural Economics, University of Nigeria, Nsukka, Enugu State, Nigeria 2 Department of Agricultural Economics and Farm Management, University of Ilorin, Kwara State, Nigeria ABSTRACT. Food insecurity remains a major challenge worldwide, especially among the rural areas of developing nation. Women and children are most vulnerable to this phenomenon. However, while many studies have assessed farming households’ food security status in general, there is dearth of information on vegetable farmers’, who are mostly women, food security status in particular. This study, therefore, investigated the food security status of vegetable farming households, its drivers and coping strategies in Kwara State, Nigeria. Descriptive statistics, food insecurity index and logistic regression were used to analysed data collected from 180 respondents. The findings showed that food insecurity remains a major challenge in rural areas as only 45.55% were food secure. The food secure group surpassed the food security line by 17%. Food insecure group fell below the food security line by 36% with a daily average calorie intake of 1581.35 kcal. Annual income (p< 0.1), cooperative membership (p< 0.1), vegetable production (p< 0.05) and access to credit (p< 0.05) were the significant factors enhancing their food security status, while household size (p< 0.01) negatively influenced it. The widely used food insecurity coping mechanisms by the households were eating less expensive food, eating wild fruits, reducing rational consumption, allowing children to eat first, borrowing money to buy food, buying food on credit and skipping meal within a day. The study recommends encouragement of vegetable production through provision of credit facilities to the farmers as this would enhance their food security status.","This paper describes the earning activities of Rural Women Farmers in Ekiti Kwara to identify processes of food production and Agriculture within a farming season.200 farmers were examined through the use of questionnaire administration. Results were processed through the use of simple tabulations and inferential statistics. Findings revealed that that 75.5% of the respondents have access to land for farming while the remaining 24.5% not to have a land of their own ,but they are those that depend on either family lands or go on leasing from other land owners. Apart from their mothering roles, women here are contributing heavily to nutritional development, farm employment and food security. About 54.5% of the women farmers in the study area provides food for their household; topmost in their farm productions are in the area of vegetables, fruits livestock and fishery. However, income earnings from farm is generally low due to the subsistent nature of their production .The result of the stepwise multiple regression showed that about 75.69% differences in the variation of women participation is explained by three variables of supplementing income, debt servicing measure and food security respectively and appropriate recommendations are presented accordingly.","This study was carried out to identify the factor which influences rural women’s income after participation in small-scale agricultural farming, their contribution to the household, as well as their empowerment status. This research was conducted in Jinaigati upazila of Sherpur district in Bangladesh. A total of 80 respondents (women) from this upazilla of Sherpur were selected purposively using simple random sampling. The quantitative data were collected by in depth interviewing of the 80 respondents through personal interview. The quantitative analytical tools used to attain specific objectives included various descriptive statistics, functional analysis, multiple regression co-efficient, used to identify the factors of influencing women’s income through small-scale agricultural farming. Problem Confrontation Index (PCI) used through different problems identified scores. In accordance with the results of the educational level of woman, other sources of income, experience and training, access to credit, decision-making ability have a positive influence on rural women’s income, and these variables were statistically significant. From the Problem Confrontation Index, it was found that lack of capital was the first ranked problem, need-based training the second ranked problem, high interest rate the third ranked problem, insufficient farm size the fourth ranked problem, and lack of quality of seed the fifth ranked problem. Their income from this brought remarkable positive change in their life and they had better control over their decisions and income. Finally, their active economical participation in small-scale farming assists them to overcome prejudice, socio-economic barriers, and highest empowerment attainment in the context of Bangladesh—and, if the government takes proper initiative in terms of gender policy, then rural women’s income and livelihood status will be increased remarkably.","SUMMARY This paper aims to determine the influence of family farming features on efficient use of water. The analysis focusses on a random sample of family farms in the province of Almería, southeast Spain. A hierarchical regression model was conducted to determine how the water efficiency is related to environmental awareness and certain characteristics of farmers, decision-makers and the family farm itself. The results show that these family farms strive to be more efficient in their use of water when they are going to be inherited, when there are younger decision-makers who have received a better education, and also when women are involved. Moreover, this efficiency is positively related to more ecological production and to the farmer's habitual behaviour with respect to water economy. The study provides evidence regarding the influences of socio-economic and environmental features of family farming on water use efficiency that may prove useful for other analyses and policy makers on water management in agriculture.","Information is very important for sustainable agricultural development. In order to increase agricultural production, enhance good distribution strategies, achieve improve and efficient marketing system, agricultural information should be at the central position. This study evaluated elements of rural economics: access to agricultural information among rural women farmers in Abuja, Nigeria. The specific objectives are to: identify the socio-economic characteristics of rural women farmers, examine the various ways rural women farmers have access to agricultural information, and evaluate the factors influencing rural women farmers’ access to new agricultural information in Abuja, Nigeria. A sample of 90 rural women farmers was selected through a multistage sampling technique from three selected agricultural extension blocks namely: Byazhin, Kubwa and Bwari Central. The data were collected with the aid of a questionnaire. The analytical tools used were descriptive statistics and Maximum Likelihood Estimates using Logit regression model. The results indicated that about 94 percent of the rural women farmers were less than 55years of age which implies that most of the rural women farmers are in their active age. About 86 percent of the rural women farmers were married. Household sizes were large, 76 percent of rural women farmers had less than 10 members. Furthermore, 97 percent of the rural women farmers had less than 30 years farming experiences. In addition, 92 percent of the rural women farmers realized income less than N 100, 000.00 or 318 US Dollar from the sales of their farm products annually. The results further show that the print media and audio-visuals (radio and television) were the major information sources of rural women farmers. The Logit model results revealed that age, marital status and members of farmer’s cooperative association had positive and significant relationships with access to agricultural knowledge and information atrespectively. The coefficient of Nagelkerke determinant (R2) value was 0.658. The coefficient of Cox and Snell determinant (R2) value was 0.488. The study recommends that well-trained female extension agents should be provided in the study area to train the rural women farmers on modern farming techniques that will increase agricultural productivity or yields.","This study aimed at examining the effect of crop commercialisation on rural households’ poverty in Tanzania. The household survey data was collected from a sample of 389 rural households. Commercialisation index was used to estimate the level of household crop commercialisation. The principal component analysis was used to develop a household welfare index which was then clustered to identify poor and non-poor households through cluster analysis, the method automatically guided the decision retaining two clusters by calculating the measure-of-fit that is Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). To examine the factors affecting the household poverty status, a logistic model was employed. Results revealed that the majority (65.6%) of the households are poor. The level of crop commercialisation is averaged to 66% indicating a commercialised farming practice. The results further showed that crop commercialisation, women participation in crop income allocation, off-farm income, access to extension services and household size significantly reduce household poverty while household head’s age had an adverse effect. The study suggests that the small and medium agricultural processing units in rural areas should be given priorities and strengthened since they are crucial to promoting the level of commercialisation among rural households. Furthermore, in periods of sufficient and excess harvest, the crops trade restrictions with the neighbour countries should be eliminated to increase the level of commercialisation and earnings to the local rural farmers.","Abstract Family farming plays a vital role in mountain areas. Its survival is related to multiple factors, including intrafamily farm succession. This study examined data on apple-producing family farms in an Italian Alpine valley, trying to identify which factors foster or discourage intrafamily succession and to what extent they do this, both at the farm level and from the potential successor's viewpoint. To do so, various farm, farmer, and individual characteristics were analyzed using probabilistic regression. We found that intrafamily succession was more likely when the farm was managed by a woman (+20%) with a high school diploma (+13%) who had at least 1 child with specialized education in agriculture (+27%) and when farm sales had increased in recent years (+25%). We also found that a child's willingness to take over the family farm decreases as the number of farm children increases and when the child is a female with a high school diploma; however, the likelihood that children will take over the family business rises as farmer education level and work experience increase. These findings, while mixed, suggest that women play a key role in keeping family farming alive in mountain areas, along with education of family members, improved marketability of agricultural products, and in general, competitiveness and profitability of the family farm.",21.7306054995504,Farmer Cooperatives

Objectives: We examined associations between RA and pesticides or other agricultural exposures among female spouses of licensed pesticide applicators in the Agricultural Health Study. Methods: Women were enrolled between 1993 and 1997 and followed through 2010. Cases (n = 275 total, 132 incident), confirmed by a physician or by self-reported use of disease modifying antirheumatic drugs, were compared with noncases (n = 24,018). Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated using logistic regression models adjusted for age, state, and smoking pack-years. Results: Overall, women with RA were somewhat more likely to have reported lifetime use of any specific pesticide versus no pesticides (OR = 1.4; 95% CI: 1.0, 1.6). Of the 15 pesticides examined, maneb/mancozeb (OR = 3.3; 95% CI: 1.5, 7.1) and glyphosate (OR = 1.4; 95% CI: 1.0, 2.1) were associated with incident RA compared with no pesticide use. An elevated, but non-statistically significant association with incident RA was seen for DDT (OR = 1.9; 95% CI: 0.97, 3.6). Incident RA was also associated with the application of chemical fertilizers (OR = 1.7; 95% CI: 1.1, 2.7) and cleaning with solvents (OR = 1.6; 95% CI: 1.1, 2.4), but inversely associated with lifetime livestock exposure as a child and adult (OR = 0.48; 95% CI: 0.24, 0.97) compared with no livestock exposure. Conclusions: Our results suggest that specific agricultural pesticides, solvents, and chemical fertilizers may increase the risk of RA in women, while exposures involving animal contact may be protective.

METHODS National registers were cross-matched in Norway and 246,043 male and female farmers born in 1925-1971 were identified, as were their 264,262 children, born in 1952-1980, in agricultural censuses and in the population register. The subjects were followed in the Cancer Register through 1995. Farmers' births, conceived in 1973-1991, were identified, and the prevalences of late-term abortion in mothers and hypospadias and cryptorchidism in their sons at birth were examined. Exposure, defined as the combination of grain farming and categories of seasonal or cumulative warnings, was based on data in agricultural censuses and on local, seasonal, field fungal warnings. Estimated adjusted rate ratios or prevalence ratios served as the measures of association. RESULTS Categories of high exposure were associated with reproductive outcomes and cancer among female farmers, the strongest occurring for late-term abortion (ratio 2.6, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.6-4.3). Exposure associations for ovarian and breast cancer, and male genital defects, were more moderate. Endometrial cancer was associated with grain farming (ratio 2.0, 95% CI 1.4-2.8) across all levels of fungal warnings. Exposure associations for cancer were strongest for premenopausal, parous women. Exposure was not associated with cancer among male farmers or children. CONCLUSIONS Climatic conditions favoring fungal growth in grain were associated with hormone-dependent adverse outcomes among female farmers; the results are consistent with hormonal effects of inhaled mycotoxins during pregnancy.","Early life conditions play an important role in determining adult body size. In particular, childhood malnutrition and disease can elicit growth delays and affect adult body size if severe or prolonged enough. In the earliest stages of farming, skeletal growth impairment and small adult body size are often documented relative to hunter-gatherer groups, though this pattern is regionally variable. In Central/Southeast Europe, it is unclear how early life stress, growth history, and adult body size were impacted by the introduction of agriculture and ensuing long-term demographic, social, and behavioral change. The current study assesses this impact through the reconstruction and analysis of mean stature, body mass, limb proportion indices, and sexual dimorphism among 407 skeletally mature men and women from foraging and farming populations spanning the Late Mesolithic through Early Medieval periods in Central/Southeast Europe (~7100 calBC to 850 AD). Results document significantly reduced mean stature, body mass, and crural index in Neolithic agriculturalists relative both to Late Mesolithic hunter-gatherer-fishers and to later farming populations. This indication of relative growth impairment in the Neolithic, particularly among women, is supported by existing evidence of high developmental stress, intensive physical activity, and variable access to animal protein in these early agricultural populations. Among subsequent agriculturalists, temporal increases in mean stature, body mass, and crural index were more pronounced among Central European women, driving declines in the magnitude of sexual dimorphism through time. Overall, results suggest that the transition to agriculture in Central/Southeast Europe was challenging for early farming populations, but was followed by gradual amelioration across thousands of years, particularly among Central European women. This sex difference may be indicative, in part, of greater temporal variation in the social status afforded to young girls, in their access to resources during growth, and/or in their health status than was experienced by men.","To the Editor: Ningxia is the smallest provincial autonomous region on the Loess Plateau in central China, with a population of ≈5.5 million persons composed of 35 ethnic and various religious groups. The natural environmental conditions and socioreligious ethnic status in Ningxia, particularly the southern region, are conducive to sheep farming, an important part of the agricultural economy. Both cystic echinococcosis (CE) and alveolar echinococcosis (AE) (1) are endemic in the northwest part of China; high prevalences have been reported in several provinces (1), including Gansu (2,3) and the Xinjiang Uigur Autonomous Region (4). Little information is available about the extent of human echinococcosis in Ningxia; this is the first report of a provincial investigation for both human CE and AE there. We conducted a retrospective survey of clinical records from 7 local county hospitals and 4 other hospitals in Yinchuan to determine the epidemiology of human echinococcosis in southern Ningxia. All surgical and clinical records were checked, and diagnoses were confirmed based on imaging, surgical reports, and histopathologic reports. Data concerning age, sex, domicile, ethnicity, occupation, year of diagnosis, cyst or lesion numbers and anatomical location, type and duration of anthelminthic treatment (if given), and the nature and number of surgeries performed for echinococcosis were recorded for each confirmed CE and AE patient. From 1985 to 2002, a total of 2,216 cases of echinococcosis were recorded, most of which were due to CE (96%). The incidence of combined CE and AE from 1994 to 2001 was 7/100,000 persons for southern Ningxia, compared with 1/100,000 persons for Yinchuan in the north (Table). Human AE cases were reported only from the 3 southern counties of Xiji, Haiyuan, and Guyuan; CE cases occurred throughout Ningxia, with a mixed endemic focus for both human CE and AE in the south. A variable distribution of AE and CE cases from 1994 to 2001 was evident from hospital records. Both AE and CE were recorded in Xiji (6/100,000 persons), Guyuan (5/100,000 persons), and Haiyuan (11/100,000 persons) counties. CE incidences for Tongxin (13/100,000 persons) and Pengyang (5/100,000 persons) were substantially higher than for Longde (0.5/100,000 persons) and Jingyuan (0.15/100,000 persons). This heterogeneous distribution of echinococcosis may reflect different patterns of parasite transmission in different areas of Ningxia. CE and AE incidence (Table) were compared for 1994 and 2001 by chi-square test. Apart from a substantial increase in Haiyuan (p<0.05) and a substantial decrease in Xiji (p<0.05), no other substantial incidence changes were apparent (Table). Table Average incidence of human echinococcosis (AE/CE combined), 1994–2001, and incidence compared for ethnicity (Han/Hui) in southern Ningxia and Yinchuan City* Patients' ages ranged from 1 to 80 years for men and from 3 to 77 years for women (mean age 35.7 years). The patient sex ratio was 0.72 (916 men, 1,268 women), whereas the population sex ratio was 1.05, indicating significant differences in echinococcosis case numbers between men and women (p<0.05). Farm laborers accounted for 66.1% (1,464/2,216) of cases, students 12.4% (275/2,216), workers and self-employed 5.2% (116/2,216), village leaders 4.8% (106/2,216), teachers and housewives 0.9% (21/2,216), butchers 0.2% (4/2,216), and others 0.1%. A comparison of the ethnic composition ratio (5) with an average incidence from 1994 to 2001 showed a substantial difference between the Hui and Han nationalities in Yinchuan, Haiyuan, and Pengyang, and for Ningxia as a whole. No substantial difference was shown in Longde, Tongxin, Guyuan, and Xiji for the 2 ethnic groups by incidence risk ratios with 95% confidence intervals (Table). Radical surgery to remove CE cysts was performed for 83.3% of patients; only 7.3% of patients received combined albendazole or mebendazole chemotherapy pre- and post-surgery. Recurrences of CE cysts that required surgery were high (30%), suggesting inadequate surgical and medical care. Most AE patients received only chemotherapy treatment and were at an advanced stage of infection. The retrospective data of human AE and CE infection rates in the current study suggest that disease transmission was more pronounced 10–15 years earlier. The landscape of woods and scrub cover was greater then, domestic sheep and dog populations were larger, and red fox and rodent species densities were likely higher, providing optimal transmission conditions for both Echinococcus granulosus and E. multilocularis. The incidence data (2001) for human CE and AE are likely underestimated for several reasons. Access to medical treatment for villagers is problematic and many asymptomatic cases (6) would be excluded. An age and sex bias also exists, as generally older persons and women receive most of the limited medical attention. Furthermore, the high surgical costs for treatment (CE and AE), especially in the past 10 years, coupled with poor economic development, preclude access to treatment in many rural communities. Because abdominal ultrasound examinations for CE and AE can identify clinically silent infections (7,8), comprehensive community-based studies are needed to identify asymptomatic or early-stage cases. Our study provides accurate data to determine the true prevalence and incidence of CE and AE, which contributes to better treatment outcomes. These data can help determine the reasons for the heterogeneity of disease distribution in Ningxia to better prepare for future echinococcosis control strategies throughout the region.","Purpose The Manicaland cohort was established to provide robust scientific data on HIV prevalence and incidence, patterns of sexual risk behaviour and the demographic impact of HIV in a sub-Saharan African population subject to a generalised HIV epidemic. The aims were later broadened to include provision of data on the coverage and effectiveness of national HIV control programmes including antiretroviral therapy (ART). Participants General population open cohort located in 12 sites in Manicaland, east Zimbabwe, representing 4 major socioeconomic strata (small towns, agricultural estates, roadside settlements and subsistence farming areas). 9,109 of 11,453 (79.5%) eligible adults (men 17-54 years; women 15–44 years) were recruited in a phased household census between July 1998 and January 2000. Five rounds of follow-up of the prospective household census and the open cohort were conducted at 2-year or 3-year intervals between July 2001 and November 2013. Follow-up rates among surviving residents ranged between 77.0% (over 3 years) and 96.4% (2 years). Findings to date HIV prevalence was 25.1% at baseline and had a substantial demographic impact with 10-fold higher mortality in HIV-infected adults than in uninfected adults and a reduction in the growth rate in the worst affected areas (towns) from 2.9% to 1.0%pa. HIV infection rates have been highest in young adults with earlier commencement of sexual activity and in those with older sexual partners and larger numbers of lifetime partners. HIV prevalence has since fallen to 15.8% and HIV incidence has also declined from 2.1% (1998-2003) to 0.63% (2009-2013) largely due to reduced sexual risk behaviour. HIV-associated mortality fell substantially after 2009 with increased availability of ART. Future plans We plan to extend the cohort to measure the effects on the epidemic of current and future HIV prevention and treatment programmes. Proposals for access to these data and for collaboration are welcome.","OBJECTIVE Despite the intensive use of pesticides in agriculture there are few studies assessing the risk of respiratory conditions from this exposure. The study aimed at quantifying the prevalence of respiratory symptoms among farmers and evaluating its relationship with occupational use of pesticides and the prevalence of respiratory symptoms. METHODS A cross-sectional study was conducted among 1,379 farmers from two municipalities of Southern Brazil in 1996. Frequency and type of chemical exposure and pesticide poisoning were recorded for both sexes. All subjects aged 15 years or older with at least 15 weekly hours of agricultural activity were interviewed. An adapted questionnaire developed by the American Thoracic Society was used for the assessment of respiratory symptoms. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was carried out. RESULTS More than half (55%) of interviewees were male. The prevalence of asthma symptoms was 12% and chronic respiratory disease symptoms was 22%. Higher odds ratios for both asthma (OR=1.51; 95% CI: 1.07-2.14) and chronic respiratory disease (OR=1.34; 95% CI 1.00-1.81) symptoms were found in women. Logistic regression analysis identified associations between many forms of exposure to pesticides and increased respiratory symptoms. Occurrence of pesticide poisoning was associated with higher prevalence of asthma symptoms (OR=1.54; 95% CI: 1.04-2.58) and chronic respiratory disease symptoms (OR=1.57; 95% CI: 1.08-2.28). CONCLUSIONS In spite of causality limitations, the study results provide evidence that farming exposure to pesticides is associated with higher prevalence of respiratory symptoms, especially when the exposure is above two days per month.","The advent of farming was associated with thousands of years of manual labor for women that exceeded that of living athletes. The intensification of agriculture is often associated with declining mobility and bone strength through time, although women often exhibit less pronounced trends than men. For example, previous studies of prehistoric Central European agriculturalists (~5300 calibrated years BC to 850 AD) demonstrated a significant reduction in tibial rigidity among men, whereas women were characterized by low tibial rigidity, little temporal change, and high variability. Because of the potential for sex-specific skeletal responses to mechanical loading and a lack of modern comparative data, women’s activity in prehistory remains difficult to interpret. This study compares humeral and tibial cross-sectional rigidity, shape, and interlimb loading among prehistoric Central European women agriculturalists and living European women of known behavior (athletes and controls). Prehistoric female tibial rigidity at all time periods was highly variable, but differed little from living sedentary women on average, and was significantly lower than that of living runners and football players. However, humeral rigidity exceeded that of living athletes for the first ~5500 years of farming, with loading intensity biased heavily toward the upper limb. Interlimb strength proportions among Neolithic, Bronze Age, and Iron Age women were most similar to those of living semi-elite rowers. These results suggest that, in contrast to men, rigorous manual labor was a more important component of prehistoric women’s behavior than was terrestrial mobility through thousands of years of European agriculture, at levels far exceeding those of modern women.","Background Pesticide exposure and its adverse impacts remain a major problem for women’s health, but a comprehensive scientific literature and summaries are still missing. With a specific focus in sub-Saharan Africa, this paper provides an overview of the scientific literature on how women deal with and are exposed to pesticides and the specific circumstances that might affect their health. We identified previously published studies from Google Scholar, Pubmed, and other electronic libraries. Main body In addition to huge burden in the household, there is considerable evidence that women’s role in smallholder as well as commercial farming has become more visible and intense in sub-Saharan Africa. However, it is evident that women are a major risk group disproportionately exposed to and are affected by pesticides through multiple pathways. Closely linked to their biological characteristics, lifestyle and behavior, women experience acute-to-chronic diseases from pesticides. Women’s exposure to pesticides either during pregnancy or breastfeeding can pose a serious health risk for the fetus and the newborn babies. Conclusion Occupational as well as non-occupational exposure from pesticides seems to be grossly underestimated for women due to the perception that their work is not hazardous for their health and are not at risk of exposure. This is often the case why research on pesticide exposure and its adverse impacts for women’s health remains scarce in sub-Saharan Africa, where pesticides are often misused and poorly regulated. Therefore, further research that addresses women’s exposure to pesticides are strongly suggested.","ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION For two decades, various countries have experienced an epidemic of chronic kidney disease unexplainable by traditional causes. Typically a chronic tubulointerstitial nephritis, it predominantly affects young male agricultural workers and has been reported in several countries in Central America, as well as in Sri Lanka, India and Egypt. Recent studies in El Salvador have also reported the disease in male nonagricultural workers and in women, both those working in agriculture and not. Epidemiological information on whether this condition affects pediatric populations is virtually nonexistent. Globally, estimates of chronic kidney disease prevalence in pediatric populations range from 21 to 108 per million population. OBJECTIVE Determine the prevalence of urinary markers of renal damage and of chronic kidney disease in persons aged 300 mg/g) was detected only in girls in Las Brisas, 2.3%. Glomerular hyperfiltration (compared to international norms) was found in all age-sex groups in all three regions. Prevalence of chronic kidney disease was 3.9%—4.1% in girls and 3.6% in boys. The prevalence of chronic renal failure was 0.1%. CONCLUSIONS High prevalence of chronic kidney disease in children and adolescents calls attention to the need for primary prevention from very early ages. This finding in children in areas where chronic kidney disease of uncertain etiology is common in adults is consistent with a contribution of environmental toxins to the epidemic observed in these areas.","BACKGROUND The agriculture, forestry and fishing industry sector has high rates of occupational injuries. Fishing has globally particularly high occupational fatality rates, but injuries and illnesses to people working in its sub-sectors, aquaculture and fish farming, are not well understood. MATERIALS AND METHODS This study characterised injuries and occupational diseases to fish farmers and people employed on fish farms in Finland using national employment and accident insurance (workers' compensation) data. RESULTS A total of 392 injuries and 18 occupational diseases were compensated during 1996 to 2015 to fish farmers and people employed on fish farms in Finland. The average injury rate was 3.2 injuries per 100 employed persons with no significant trend over time. Two of the injuries were fatal. Injured persons were primarily male (87.2%), in 45-54 year age group (39.1%), and working in coastal areas (49%). Com- mon injury characteristics included: incident type: slips, trips, and falls (37%); location: building, structure or ground level surface (28%); injured body part: hand or finger (25%); type of injury: dislocation, sprain, strain (35%); and lost worktime: 1 to 2 weeks (26.9%). Seven out of 18 occupational diseases occurred to women, most resulting in cumulative trauma from fish processing. CONCLUSIONS The injury rate in fish farming corresponds to rate in all industries combined in Finland, and is higher than the rate in available Nordic statistics on fish farming. Fish farming injuries could be reduced further by slip resistant surfaces, protection of hands and fingers and ergonomics in processing.",16.875891064743,Livestock Health

Rural young men and women are key players in this process. In this article, we use the experiences, aspirations and dreams of rural young people in the Saiss to describe and discuss current agrarian dynamics to 1) illustrate how these are intimately linked to agrarian transformation; 2) demonstrate how futures and identities are deeply gendered; and 3) provide nuance to structural analyses of agrarian change with ethnographic accounts of how changes are perceived by the people experiencing them. Our analysis shows how young people skillfully and cautiously negotiate space to realize their aspirations. In doing so they carve out new and more modern farming identities and are able to combine rurality with modernity. Nevertheless, they are situated in web of power relations hampering the fulfillment of their aspirations and dreams. This forces some to put their dreams on hold and find alternative futures, a result that will strongly influence and determine the future of the countryside.","It is sometimes argued that women play a more important role in seed and diversity management than men, and that women have greater abilities in managing crop diversity. In The Gambia, men and women also have the belief that women are better in managing and identifying varieties than men. This article focuses on the role of gender in farmer management of crop diversity in two crops, rice which is cultivated by women and pearl millet which is cultivated by men. First a historical overview is given of the role of gender in farming. The management of crop diversity in rice and millet and gendered knowledge in The Gambia is described in detail. Lastly, a grouping experiment with rice panicles and millet spikes is described. The article shows that clear differences exist between the farming practices of men and women, and these are based on a complex interplay of socio-economic and agro-ecological factors. But the differences in seed selection practices of men and women are small, and those differences that exist can best be explained by a complex of agroecological factors and rice and millet characteristics. The grouping experiment showed no significant differences in the way men and women grouped rice panicles and millet spikes. Together these findings suggest that the supposedly better skills of women in crop variety management are related to their gender identity rather than to any biological differences. Instead of taking the supposedly strong skills of women in seed and variety management as a starting point for agricultural development, it is better to understand the underlying mechanism that keep women in disadvantaged positions in rural societies and to try to change these mechanisms for their benefit. Key words: The Gambia, gender, agricultural labor, crop variety management","BackgroundIn countries where the majority of undernourished people are smallholder farmers, there has been interest in agricultural interventions to improve nutritional outcomes. Addressing gender inequality, however, is a key mechanism by which agriculture can improve nutrition, since women often play a crucial role in farming, food processing and child care, but have limited decision-making and control over agricultural resources. This study examines the approaches by which gender equity in agrarian, resource-poor settings can be improved using a case study in Malawi.MethodsA quasi-experimental design with qualitative methods was used to examine the effects of a participatory intervention on gender relations. Thirty married couple households in 19 villages with children under the age of 5 years were interviewed before and then after the intervention. An additional 7 interviews were conducted with key informants, and participant observation was carried out before, during the intervention and afterwards in the communities. The interviews were recorded and transcribed, and analysed qualitatively for key themes, concepts and contradictions.ResultsSeveral barriers were identified that undermine the quality of child care practices, many linked to gender constructions and norms. The dominant concepts of masculinity created shame and embarrassment if men deviated from these norms, by cooking or caring for their children. The study provided evidence that participatory education supported new masculinities through public performances that encouraged men to take on these new roles. Invoking men’s family responsibilities, encouraging new social norms alongside providing new information about different healthy recipes were all pathways by which men developed new ‘emergent’ masculinities in which they were more involved in cooking and child care. The transformational approach, intergenerational and intra-gendered events, a focus on agriculture and food security, alongside involving male leaders were some of the reasons that respondents named for changed gender norms.ConclusionsParticipatory education that explicitly addresses hegemonic masculinities related to child nutrition, such as women’s roles in child care, can begin to change dominant gender norms. Involving male leaders, participatory methods and integrating agriculture and food security concerns with nutrition appear to be key components in the context of agrarian communities.","Boosting smallholder food production can potentially improve children’s nutrition in rural Sub-Saharan Africa through a production-own consumption pathway and an income-food purchase pathway. Rigorously designed studies are needed to provide evidence for nutrition impact, but are often difficult to implement in agricultural projects. Within the framework of a large agricultural development project supporting legume production (N2Africa), we studied the potential to improve children’s dietary diversity by comparing N2Africa and non-N2Africa households in a cross-sectional quasi-experimental design, followed by structural equation modelling (SEM) and focus group discussions in rural Ghana and Kenya. Comparing N2Africa and non-N2Africa households, we found that participating in N2Africa was not associated with improved dietary diversity of children. However, for soybean, SEM indicated a relatively good fit to the posteriori model in Kenya but not in Ghana, and in Kenya only the production-own consumption pathway was fully supported, with no effect through the income-food purchase pathway. Results are possibly related to differences in the food environment between the two countries, related to attribution of positive characteristics to soybean, the variety of local soybean-based dishes, being a new crop or not, women’s involvement in soybean cultivation, the presence of markets, and being treated as a food or cash crop. These findings confirm the importance of the food environment for translation of enhanced crop production into improved human nutrition. This study also shows that in a situation where rigorous study designs cannot be implemented, SEM is a useful option to analyse whether agriculture projects have the potential to improve nutrition.","This study explored the effectiveness of video as a tool to either complement or replace existing lecturedemonstration training for small farmer groups. The effectiveness of video in decreasing the knowledge gap among farmers who differ by gender was also evaluated. Quantitative and qualitative data were gathered through a quasi-experiment including a pretest and a posttest design with three experimental groups. Results showed that video could be an effective complement and replacement for the traditional lecturedemonstration training method. Video alone or video plus traditional lecture-demonstration was as effective as traditional training in increasing learning. The training method that included both video and traditional lecture-demonstration was especially effective for groups with relatively low prior knowledge of the training topic. However, video only was not as effective as traditional training or traditional training plus video in decreasing gaps in learning between men and women. Video has advantages in rural areas because it does not require face-to-face presentation by skilled trainers. Video might be an attractive alternative or supplement if the production cost is low enough, or if traditional lecture-demonstration cannot meet the demand for training. Using local actors, shooting video in the local environment and using local languages add to video’s advantages for training purposes. When used to demonstrate a farming technique or practice in a group setting, videos were found to enhance interaction (e.g. discussion and peer learning) among farmers.","In the context of studies on the effects of agricultural production diversity, there are debates in the scientific community as to the level of diversification appropriate for improving dietary diversity. In Tunisia, agriculture is a strategic sector for the economy and a critical pillar of its food sovereignty. Using instrumental variable methods to account for endogeneity, we have estimated the association between agricultural production diversity and women’s dietary diversity among smallholder farming households in the Sidi Bouzid governorate (central Tunisia). Although we found a low level of agricultural production diversity and a fairly diversified diet among women, we observed a systematic weak positive association between five different indicators of agricultural production diversity and women’s dietary diversity. We observed a stronger positive association between women’s dietary diversity and women being more educated and households being wealthier. Neither diversity of food supplies in food markets nor market distance were associated with women’s dietary diversity, whereas we observed a higher level of consumption of some products (dairy) when they were produced on the farm.","ABSTRACT Despite increasing sustainable agricultural intensification (SAI) investments, indicators for detecting gender and intergenerational inequities in SAI costs and benefits sharing often remain overgeneralized, theoretical, or locally irrelevant. We examine the relative value of, and how to, customize standard SAI indicators to detect such inequities in specific socio-cultural contexts to enhance data collection for evidence-based decision making in fostering gender/youth inclusive SAI. Using focus-group discussions and key informant interviews among farmers and diverse government, NGO, private sector, and academic stakeholders in two districts in Malawi and three in Ghana, we assess the perceived roles, differentiated needs/priorities of men, women and youth, and the sharing of SAI burdens and benefits within farming households. We investigate what context-appropriate questions to ask, to whom, and how, to collect reliable information on indicators of SAI-investment inequities. Results illuminate context-specific, gendered and intergenerational factors shaping access to and ownership of productive resources, household decision making, SAI participation, and appropriateness of selected indicators. Combining farmers' and local field-expert' perspectives offers practical insights for customizing inequity indicators. Findings highlight advantages of local contextualization of SAI indicators, including insights on appropriate data-collection approaches that challenge orthodox survey/quantitative methods for detecting and assessing gender/age inequities to foster inclusive SAI.","Evidence from climate-smart village (CSV) approach to mainstream climate-smart agriculture (CSA) demonstrates improved productivity, income, and reduced climatic risks. However, its contribution to gender empowerment in diverse farming households is not documented. This study creates a Gender Empowerment Index for climate-smart villages (GEI-CSV) based on four major measurable indicators—political, economic, agricultural, and social. The gender gap was derived by mapping difference in empowerment levels across selected CSVs and non-CSVs. These indicators can be used as a vital tool to understand the process of gender empowerment that can trigger the entry points to achieve gender equality, which is also an important aspect in the adoption of climate-smart agriculture practices (CSAPs). The study measures empowerment at the inter-household and intra-household level across CSVs and non-CSVs from the individual household survey with both female and male members of the same household. This paper provides evidence demonstrating how gender empowerment differs in CSVs and non-CSVs from selected climate-smart villages (community-based approach) in two contrasting ecologies and socio-economic settings of India. The study documents the existing gender gap in CSVs and non-CSVs across India’s western (Haryana) and eastern (Bihar) Indo-Gangetic Plains (IGP). Irrespective of CSVs and non-CSVs, considerable differences in outlook and gender gap were observed between Bihar and Haryana. Both women and men in Bihar are less empowered than they are in Haryana. High empowerment level in CSVs than non-CSVs shows that the concept of CSVs has brought a change towards knowledge and capacity enhancement of both women and men farmers promoting gender equality in farming households with a varying scope of interventions made and required for scaling CSAPs across the diversity of farming households.","Malnutrition and food insecurity remain high in rural Rwanda, where residents consume a low-diversity diet provided through subsistence farming. Agricultural interventions using kitchen gardens may improve diet diversity in some populations. However, little is known about their efficacy when developed using community-based participatory research in combination with nutrition education focused on the empowerment of women. The objective of this study was to develop and implement a kitchen garden and nutrition education intervention using a community-engaged model and examine its impact on household diet diversity and food security. Using a mixed methods community-level design, we assessed a 16-week intervention implemented in Cyanika, Rwanda. Stratified purposeful sampling was used to select women participants representing 42 households. Household diet diversity scores (HHDS) and hunger scores were calculated at the baseline, post-intervention and one-year follow-up. HDDS increased after intervention from a pre-intervention intake of 2.59 [1.3] food groups/day, to 4.85 [1.6] at four months post-intervention and at one year post-intervention, reaching 5.55 [1.3]. There were no significant changes in household hunger scores. Our results indicate that collaborative community-engaged nutrition-sensitive agricultural interventions can increase household diet diversity; however, future work should explore whether this type of intervention strategy can lead to sustained changes and impact nutritional adequacy in this population.","Agricultural innovation is considered paramount in solving poverty, food insecurity and malnutrition in the global south and notably in the East-African highlands. However, processes of change surrounding innovation in agriculture, and potential gender differences in their impacts, are often poorly understood. This paper resorts to principles from Farming Systems Research (FSR) and social gender analysis to study agricultural innovation processes and increase the understanding of the differential ways men and women engage with and are impacted by agricultural innovation(s). We analyze qualitative data from six Focus Group Discussions conducted in each of the two study communities located in Central and Western Uganda. These data focus on the most important agricultural innovations as perceived and assessed by men and women in their community. We list and discuss these most important innovations and further zoom in on one innovation per site: “Use of herbicides in maize production” in Central Uganda and “New agronomic practices for intensified highland banana production” in Western Uganda. Results clearly show that women's and men's domains are not separated as superficially might appear. Women and men have both separate and joint interests and adoption of an innovation by one gender, will affect the other too. The effects are multifold, with positive and negative elements. Women's ability to innovate is constrained as compared to men because gender norms limit women's agency in relation to mobility and financial independence amongst others. The two innovations studied were found to alter some gender roles and relations but did not unambiguously contribute to increasing gender equality.",16.79272067962,Farm Mechanization

In substantiating both, women question the limited optics through which Fair Trade type sustainability ventures measure their work for a tea cooperative, as well poorly recognizing their entrepreneurial work in their households and community. Women are deeply aware of the politics of Fair Trade where their productive and reproductive labor is appropriated through the labor of organics, where women not only produce the organic green leaf tea but also produce narratives of Fair Trade's success in its certification and gender audits. Thus, to understand what sustains the new wave of ""sustainable agriculture"" in the global South, we must explore the intersections of organic farming practices with emerging discourses and practices of gendered entrepreneurialism in organic farming communities. In Darjeeling, India, women provide the labor necessary to sustain organics that should ideally come from the Indian state or international trading partners. They fill the gap through their labor, time, creativity and risk-taking. I contend that the success of organic farming depends on critical maneuvers that entail economic and cultural entrepreneurialism, and demonstrate forms of resilience expressed through which women farmers identify and navigate the inadequacies of alternative agriculture and related Fair Trade practices. Keywords: Women organic tea farmers, women entrepreneurs, Fair Trade, rural Darjeeling, risk-taking, resilience","The paper outlines the positive contributions of organic agriculture in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). It draws upon empirical evidence from a series of studies financed by the Asian Development Bank Institute in 2005–2006 showing the benefits of organic agricultural practices and contract farming of organic agriculture products in selected Asian countries. The case studies showed that organic agriculture helped lead these countries toward the path of achieving their respective development goals, particularly the Millennium Development Goals, by 2015. The positive impacts of organic agriculture on health, incomes, and the environment are facilitated by its own well defined standards and market-based certification systems which ensure premium prices for organic producers. This has helped achieve high consumer awareness of its benefits and increased consumer demand both in developed and developing countries. Most importantly, organic agriculture fosters gender equality as it creates meaningful work (diverse tasks). It offers economic opportunities (low costs); promotes health (no synthetic chemicals); encourages biodiversity and traditional knowledge (retention of traditional seeds and farming practices); and ensures equitable work standards (equal wages and opportunities). This is particularly true for farmers, especially women, in small farming communities. Beyond 2015, the commitment of governments to fight for a sustainable and poverty-free world continues in the SDGs. This makes organic agriculture a crucial development strategy in the SDGs era.","Tanzania is primarily an agro-based economy, characterized by subsistence agricultural production that employs more than 80% of the population and contributes up to 45% of the GDP (2005). This country is endowed with a cattle population of 21.3 M, composed mainly of indigenous Zebu breeds and about 680 000 improved dairy animals. About 70% of the milk produced comes from the traditional sector (indigenous cattle) kept in rural areas, while the remaining 30% comes from improved cattle, mainly kept by smallholder producers. In Northern Tanzania and particularly in Hai district of Kilimanjaro Region, some dairy farmers organize themselves into small producer groups for the purpose of milk collecting, marketing and general promotion of the dairy sector in their community. Nronga Women Dairy Cooperative Society (NWDCS) Limited is one of such organizations dedicated to improve the well-being of the Nronga village community through promoting small-scale dairy farming and its flow-on benefits. Milk flows out of the village, and services for investment and dairy production flow into the village, ensuring a sustainable financial circulation necessary for poverty reduction, rural development and better life for the rural community. In 2001 NWDCS introduced a school milk feeding program that has attracted Australian donors since 2005. Guided by Global Development Group, a multi-faceted project, integrating micro-enterprises, business, education and child health/nutrition, was proposed and initiated by building a dairy plant in Hai District headquarters, the Boma plant. In March 2013, the Australian High Commission to East Africa approved Direct Aid Program funding of AUD 30 000 towards the NWDCS - Biogas Pilot Project in Tanzania, which included the renovation of zero-grazing cow shade units, the construction of 6-m 3 biodigester plants on each farm, and encouragement of the use of bioslurry for pasture production and home gardens.","Innovative technologies have enormous potential to improve human well-being. However, technological progress does not guarantee equitable health outcomes. As advances in technology redefine the ways people, systems and information interact, resource-poor communities are often excluded. Where technological fixes have been imposed on communities, the results have included abandoned equipment, incompatible computer programs and ineffective policies. A shift in values among leadership, communities and the creators of technology is critical to implementing technology sustainably and equitably. Numerous examples exist of technological applications that undermine equity, fairness and human rights: for example, the use of high-tech medical interventions in preference to simpler preventive measures or terminator genes that prevent the re-use of seeds for food crops. To ensure equitable outcomes, the design and implementation of technology need to respect ethical principles and local values. Decisions on the use of new technology should be made by local users, and implementation needs long-term commitment and local ownership. Here, we discuss features of technology implementation that can promote health equity, using a range of examples from the health, agriculture and economic sectors. Successful examples of technological implementation illustrate the core values of equity. The Sustainable Sciences Institute (SSI) helps develop and implement technologies, in partnership with local communities, to combat infectious diseases in low-income settings. SSI’s approach involves community-centred capacity building including training programmes, small grants, material aid and partnerships to provide long-term support.1,2 Laboratory techniques such as reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT–PCR), enzyme linked immunosorbent assay, cell culture and flow cytometry have been applied in resource-poor settings by adapting these technologies on-site and strengthening local knowledge of the principles and limitations of each technique.1 In Nicaragua, scientists can now develop diagnostic kits locally for diseases including dengue, leptospirosis and American trypanosomiasis, and diagnosis can be done by regional as well as central laboratories. Real-time RT–PCR testing for pandemic influenza was operational before the first case presented in the 2009 pandemic. The Nicaraguan National Virology Laboratory recently developed and implemented diagnostic tests for Chikungunya, a mosquito-borne viral disease that was recently introduced into Central America and the Caribbean. Training local scientists, reducing scientific isolation and promoting international collaboration enables rapid, local response to communicable disease outbreaks. Related examples exist worldwide in the arena of information and communication technologies for health. Infectious disease surveillance and laboratory and clinical management can be improved using low-cost information systems, but these must be based on local human resource capacity, hardware and software availability, and connectivity.1,3 SSI partnered with the Nicaraguan Ministry of Health to design information systems to improve data quality, reduce costs and increase decision-support for multiple end-users. In this context, mobile (mHealth) tools and web-based systems for tracking paediatric immunization, prenatal health and community health data have improved access to information at the primary care level.1 Hesperian Health Guide’s Digital Commons project shows how health information can be accessible to millions of users in digital and multi-media formats.4 The content – developed and refined with partner communities worldwide – is freely available via the internet and mobile tools, increasing equitable access to critical resources at the community level. Nongovernmental organizations such as BRAC (formerly the Bangladesh Rural Advancement Committee) support impoverished communities by using innovation to leverage their own human and material resources. In the 1960s, oral rehydration therapy was identified as a ground-breaking yet simple way to treat diarrhoeal diseases. However, it was not until oral rehydration was integrated into community health strategies that its impact was fully realized.5 BRAC trained 13 million rural women in Bangladesh to treat children in their communities using simple tools to measure salt-sugar-water solution ratios.5 In the agricultural arena, organizations such as La Via Campesina reach hundreds of thousands of farmers by teaching agro-ecological principles, improving yields while conserving natural resources and biodiversity. Capacity building that empowers communities can promote food sovereignty and mitigate determinants that perpetuate hunger. Diversified farming systems protect ecosystems by increasing the genetic diversity of crop varieties and livestock. Biodiverse and ecologically sustainable approaches are proving more productive and resilient to changing environmental conditions than modern monoculture.6 Alternative economic models that espouse the core principles of equity include microfinancing and grassroots entrepreneurship. Programmes like BRAC, Grameen and Ashoka mobilize microfinance as a social platform to deliver scaled-up services in health, education, business development and livelihood support – all critical components in breaking the cycle of poverty. Thus, technology can promote health equity, if implemented in partnership with communities and based on core values of local autonomy, fairness and ecological sustainability.","As the demographics of farmers are shifting, the ways agricultural and food policies affect and influence the decision-making and behaviours of new farmers is also changing. At the same time, there is growing interest in contesting and rebuilding Canadian food systems to address environmental and social injustices. Many new farmers are interested in agro-ecological approaches to agriculture, including both ecological practices and community-based economies. This paper examined the findings of a national survey of 1,326 new farmers, to explore challenges and opportunities in the Canadian food and farming system, as well as the municipal, provincial, and federal policies that they recommended. We also examined which programs are serving new farmers best, and how these successes could be translated elsewhere. We found that an increasing number of new farmers are coming from non-farming backgrounds and are women, potentially challenging the status quo. In particular, respondents reported facing difficulties in accessing agricultural knowledge, and that available institutional resources may not be appropriate to new types of ecological farming practices. The most significant barriers concerned affordable land and financing their developing farms. Nevertheless, these new farmers are finding diverse ways to develop their livelihoods, potentially transforming Canadian agriculture. A national food policy that works with local and regional partners and that recognizes the changing realities of new farmers is a necessary first step in helping build a sustainable, healthy, just, and resilient food system in Canada.",The importance of prividing capacity women farmer in the agricultural  sector bring a great impact on the development of the Indonesia’s agricultural  sector. This articles written to give a description of how the role of women in the  development of the agricultural sector. A qualitative approach trough a method of  participation action reseacrh used to obtain the image and problem solving faced. It  will provide understanding in more well of potential for development agriculture  in various line including potential for development entrepreneurship based  agriculture by women. This research result indicates that the woman’s role in efforts  to improve the development of the agricultural sector through the development of  entrepreneurial-based agriculture is very high.

Socioeconomic sustainability is paramount in low-income countries, where milk production and consumption represent a vehicle to improve human nutrition and health, as well as the potential for economic opportunity and improved livelihood of subsistence farmers. These benefits can only be achieved with judicious use of animal stocks and agricultural practices that do not exhaust available natural resources, which are often shared by regional farming communities. Milk and dairy foods provide variety to the diet and make significant contributions to meeting the needs for high-quality protein, calcium, magnesium, selenium, riboflavin, vitamin B12, and pantothenic acid (vitamin B5) in at-risk populations, particularly children, pregnant women, and the elderly. Milk production in low-income countries occurs largely in smallholder mixed crop-livestock systems where animals play multiple roles and may suffer from undernutrition, leading to negligible or no milk production during several months of the year. Non-food roles of livestock include draft, fuel (manure), store of capital, and insurance against crop failure. These roles and the social standing associated with animal ownership may incentivize the maintenance of large herds that place stress on feed (land) and water resources. Under these circumstances, sustainable intensification (i.e., increasing milk production from currently available resources) represents the single most important and practical strategy to improve the sustainability of milk production and consumption in low-income countries. Improving the genetic potential of animals and the availability of quality feed, and providing balanced nutrition are the most promising strategies to improve milk production and sustainability in low-income countries. For example, the deficit for milk in Ethiopia is estimated at 4.5 billion liters/year, which can be closed, in part, with balanced animal nutrition. Milk production in low-income countries will be more sustainable if it relies on natural resources available locally and regionally to supply essential nutrients to at-risk human populations.","This study aimed to identify from the literature review whether agroforestry systems have been an agricultural practice adopted by indigenous peoples for income generation and food and nutritional security. For this, a systematic review was conducted in the period from 2010 to 2020 of 92 articles, dissertations, and theses. Thus, it is found that agroforestry practices are traditional indigenous forms of farming that provide food security, income generation, and medicines, in addition to preserving biodiversity. Indigenous agroforestry is fundamental to indigenous culture, strengthening spiritual practices and the relationship with nature. Women have vital importance in the management of agroforestry practices because, through this productive practice, they ensure the food consumption of the family, besides generating income. However, women still face many difficulties in the countryside because their working hours are longer than those of men; besides not participating in decisions on the choice of species and form of management, in some countries, they still face difficulty accessing and owning land. The studies provide evidence on the economic viability of agroforestry systems. However, research gaps are identified that verify the economic and financial analysis of agroforestry models, which address the concerns of indigenous communities, aiming at food security. These analyses are essential for the implementation and continuity of the production system.","HIV/AIDS and Agriculture in Sub-Saharan Africa: Impact on Farming Systems, Agricultural Practices and Rural Livelihoods — An Overview and Annotated Bibliography By Tanja R Muller, African women leaders in agriculture and the environment (AWLAE) Series No. 1, Wageningen Academic Publishers, The Netherlands, 2004.

This paper asks whether Africa will fare better in meeting Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) addressing poverty and hunger by 2030. To answer this question, we examine a diverse body of literature and provide relevant longitudinal data collected over 13 years of field research. We find that ‘sustainable development’ is a failed concept immersed in the contemporary global economic system that favors growth over ecosystem stability and international institutions that undervalue women’s capacity for sustainability in their care-work as food providers. We examine barriers to women’s farming (climate change, gender bias, limited access to land, technology, finance) and provide examples of women’s innovative strategies for overcoming barriers in their care practices toward family and community well-being and ecosystem health. We find that Africa will likely repeat past failures without community-level interventions that empower women to achieve SDGs on poverty, hunger, gender equity, and ecosystem management. We uncover similar holistic thinking in women’s agricultural practices and scientific conception of ‘ecosystem services’.",24.2806838343117,Farmer Knowledge Sharing
