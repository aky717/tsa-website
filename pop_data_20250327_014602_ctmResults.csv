We formally characterise and name this species as Deinbollia onanae (Sapindaceae-Litchi clade) and we discuss it in the context of the assemblage of montane tree species in the Cameroon Highlands of West-Central Africa. The new species is a shade-bearing, non-pioneer understorey forest tree species reaching 15 m high and a trunk diameter that can attain over 40 cm at 1.3 m above the ground. Seed dispersal has been recorded by chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes ellioti) and by putty-nose monkeys (Cercopithecus nictitans) and the species is used by chimpanzees for nesting. Cameroon has the highest species-diversity and species endemism known in this African-Western Indian Ocean genus of 42, mainly lowland species. Deinbollia onanae is an infrequent tree species known from six locations in surviving islands of montane (sometimes also upper submontane) forest along the line of the Cameroon Highlands, including one at Ngel Nyaki in Mambilla, Nigeria. Deinbollia onanae is here assessed as Endangered according to the IUCN 2012 standard, threatened by severe fragmentation of its mountain forest habitat due to extensive and ongoing clearance for agriculture. The majority of the 28 tree species of montane forest (above 2000 m alt.) in the Cameroon Highlands are also widespread in East African mountains (i.e. are Afromontane wide). Deinbollia onanae is one of only seven species known to be endemic (globally restricted to) these highlands. It is postulated that this new species is morphologically closest to Deinbollia oreophila, a frequent species at a lower (submontane) altitudinal band of the same range. Detailed ecological data on Deinbollia onanae from the Nigerian location, Ngel Nyaki, where it has been known under the name Deinbollia “pinnata”, is reviewed.","Deinbollia onanae (Sapindaceae-Litchi clade) is here formally named and characterised as a new species to science, previously known as Deinbollia sp. 2. Cameroon has the highest species-diversity and species endemism known in this African-Western Indian Ocean genus of 42 species. Deinbollia onanae is an infrequent tree species known from five locations in surviving islands of montane (or upper submontane) forest along the line of the Cameroon Highlands. It is here assessed as Endangered according to the IUCN 2012 standard, threatened mainly by clearance of forest for agriculture. The majority of tree species characteristic of montane forest (above 2000 m alt.) in the Cameroon Highlands are also widespread in East African mountains (i.e. are Afromontane). Deinbollia onanae is one of only a very small number of species that are endemic (globally restricted to) the mountain range. It is postulated that this new species is in a sister relationship with Deinbollia oreophila, which is a frequent species of a lower (submontane) altitudinal band of the same range. It is further postulated that seed dispersal is or was by frugivorous birds, potentially turacos, alternatively by primates such as Preuss s monkey.","Monanthotaxis bali is the only known, solely montane (occurring solely above 2000 m alt.) species of the genus. It joins Monanthotaxis orophila (Rwanda) and M. discolor (Tanzania), two other species that can also occur above 2000 m alt. Monanthotaxis bali is an addition to the small number (28) of the tree species of the surviving montane forests of the Cameroon Highlands of which only eight other species are endemic. Due to its supra-axillary inflorescences, and petals arranged in one whorl but with the outer petals overlapping the inner petals distally, and rounded flower buds, the new species is placed in Hoekstra’s clade B of Monanthotaxis. The new species is unusual in being a treelet in a predominantly lianescent genus, and in lacking the glaucous underside of the leaf-blades that usually characterises the genus. Monanthotaxis bali takes the number of continental African species of the genus to 80, and makes Cameroon, with 30 species, the most species-diverse country for the genus. Monanthotaxis bali is known only from the Bali Ngemba Forest Reserve, a forest remnant under pressure of degradation and clearance in the Bamenda Highlands of Cameroon. It may already be extinct due to logging and agricultural activities. Here it is described, illustrated, mapped and assessed as Critically Endangered (Possibly Extinct) using the IUCN 2012 criteria.","We revise and update the records of strict and near-endemic species of the Bali Ngemba Forest Reserve, the largest known surviving patch (c. 8 km2 in area) of submontane or cloud forest in the Bamenda Highlands, Cameroon which have lost >96 % of their original forest due to human activities. Nine strict endemics, and 11 near endemics are now documented, a drop from the number recorded after the first survey in 2004, since when five of the provisionally named species have been formally published. We test the hypothesis that a further one of the provisionally named putative Bali Ngemba new species, Vepris sp. A, an 8 – 20 m tall tree from cloud forest in the 1310 – 1600 m altitudinal band, is indeed new to science. We compare it morphologically with other multicarpellate, apocarpous, trifoliolate Cameroon tree species formerly placed in the genus Oricia Pierre until they were subsumed into Vepris by Mziray (1992). These are Vepris trifoliolata (Engl.) Mziray and V. gabonensis (Pierre) Mziray. We conclude that Vepris sp. A is a new undescribed species here named as Vepris onanae. The new species is illustrated, mapped and its conservation status assessed as Endangered using the 2012 IUCN standard due to the threats of habitat clearance from agricultural pressures at its three locations all of which remain formally unprotected. Vepris onanae appears unique among the Guineo-Congolian African oricioid species of Vepris in occurring in cloud forest, the other species, apart from V. renierii of the Albertine Rift, occurring in lowland forest. It also differs in the very broad, (7.8 –) 11.3 – 18 cm wide leaflets of the flowering stems which have a 6-18(−30) mm long, narrowly triangular acumen (vs leaflets <12 cm wide, acumen absent or short) and in having both subsessile and pedicellate (pedicels 0.25 – 0.3 mm long and 1(– 2) mm long) male flowers (vs male flower pedicels all sessile, or all c. 3 mm long). We report for the first time on stage-dependent leaf heteromorphy in Vepris and characterise a level of sexual dimorphism more advanced than usual in the genus. We highlight the importance of protecting Bali Ngemba and other forest patches in the Bamenda Highlands if species such as Vepris onanae are not soon to become extinct.","Auger beetles (Coleoptera: Bostrichidae), also known as false powderpost beetles, are serious pests of trees, forest products, agricultural crops, and stored vegetable products in most regions of the world (Fisher 1950; Lawrence 2010). There are approximately 570 species in 89 genera worldwide (Lawrence 2010), including approximately 73 native species found in North America (Ivie 2002). Most woodboring bostrichids obtain nutrition from starch, enabling many species to utilize almost any dry wood material from an enormous host range (Ivie 2002). The frequency of non-native bostrichid interceptions at ports of entry and storage facilities around the world has increased during the last decade (Teixeira et al. 2002; Ratti 2004; Filho et al. 2006; Aukema et al. 2011; EPPO 2011; Price et al. 2011). Bostrichids, along with many other woodboring insects, are often accidentally introduced inside solid wood packing material in containerized cargo (Haack 2006). The bostrichid genus Sinoxylon Duftschmid contains 52 species, all of which are native to Asia, Africa, and Southern Europe (Borowski & Wegrzynowicz 2007) and are typically not considered primary pests. Sinoxylon species utilize a wide variety of hosts, including numerous trees, shrubs, herbaceous plants, and bamboos (Filho et al. 2006). Sinoxylon damage is typically caused by the boring of adults and larvae in the stems, branches, or twigs of dead, damaged, or stressed hosts (Nair 2007). One species has even been known to damage lead cables (Filho et al. 2006). Species of Sinoxylon are frequently intercepted in the U.S.A., representing 32% of bostrichid interceptions between 1985 and 2000 (Haack 2006; Price et al. 2011). There have been 289 Sinoxylon interceptions in the U.S.A. between 2007 and 2012 (Brian Saunders, USDA-APHIS-PPQ, Cape Canaveral, Florida, personal communication). In the continental U.S.A., there are 2 established non-native species of Sinoxylon. Sinoxylon anale Lesne and S. conigerum Gerstacker are both established in southern Florida (Peck & Thomas 1998). Another species, S. ceratoniae (L.), may be established in California (Ivie 2002). Sinoxylon anale Lesne is the most economically important and most commonly intercepted species of Sinoxylon, typically arriving in solid wood packing materials (Fisher 1950; Argaman 1987; Teixeira et al. 2002; Sittachaya et al. 2009; Beaver et al. 2011). Sinoxylon anale is native to the Indomalaya and Palearctic ecozones, where it attacks more than 70 species of plants. In the United States, Price et al. (2011) reported 2 interceptions of S. anale in Georgia in 2004 and 2010, both arriving from India in solid wood packing materials. Borowski and Wegrzynowicz (2007) list 3 other species, S. japonicum Lesne, S. sexdentatum (Olivier) (as S. muricatum (L.)), and S. ruficorne Fahaeus, as introduced into the United States, but these records are apparently based on the interceptions reported by Fisher (1950) that do not represent established populations. On 29 Aug 2011 in West Point, Mississippi, United States (N 33°36’25” W 88°39’01”), a substantial infestation of larval and adult Sinoxylon indicum Lesne (Fig. 1A) and S. sudanicum Lesne (Fig. 1B) was discovered in wooden crates and pallets that originated from Pakistan. It is not known if the wood used to construct the crates originated in Pakistan, or whether the wood was treated according to IPPC international standards","Root feeding bark beetles in the genus Hylastes Hylastes breeding in loblolly pine across 3 crown (Coleoptera: Curculionidae: Scolytinae) commoncondition classes (healthy, dying, dead).

Particularly, Diplodia spp. having a cosmopolitan distribution, are well-known as virulent of woody plant hosts including Pinus spp. In recent years, symptoms of canopy wilt, branch dieback, necrosis, and trunk cankers have been noticed on Pinus pinea trees in Tunisian forests. However, this has been less welldocumented in North Africa and especially in Tunisia. The aim of this study is to characterize the causal agent of P. pinea dieback in northeastern Tunisian forest. A collection of thirty-eight isolates obtained from symptomatic branches of P. pinea trees was identified as Diplodia seriata by means of morphological characteristics, and phylogenetic analysis of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of the nuclear ribosomal DNA. A pathogenicity test was conducted on 3-years-old P. pinea seedlings, confirmed the virulence of the fungus. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first record of D. seriata associated with branch canker on P. pinea in Tunisia.","Abstract: Vepris bali is the first known species of Vepris in WC Africa with opposite, trifoliolate leaves and is further unusual for its long petiolules. Known only from Bali Ngemba Forest Reserve, a remnant of submontane forest under great pressure of degradation in the Bamenda Highlands of Cameroon, it may already be extinct due to tree cutting and agricultural incursions. Here, V. bali is compared with other endemic cloud forest Vepris of the Cameroon Highlands and is described, illustrated, mapped and assessed as Critically Endangered (Possibly Extinct) using IUCN 2012 criteria.

Ceratocxstiopsis and  Ophiostoma are important pathogens of trees and some agricultural crops and have recently been found on proteas and forest trees in South Africa. Taxonomic controversy exists regarding these genera and ultrastructural studies on the development of asci, uniquely shaped ascospores and centrum structure are inadequate. This rev iew summarises current knowledge of ascospore shape and development of the centrum obtained from light and electron microscope studies of Cemtocystis sensu lato . Important questions requiring further investigations are outlined. It is furthermore proposed that additional ultrastructural studies are required to clarify the current taxonomic disagreement in this group. Such studies could also identify relationships between these fungi and other Ascomycetes.","Background and aims - The Coastal Forests of Eastern Africa, stretching along the Indian Ocean coastline from Somalia to Mozambique, are considered by Conservation International to be a global biodiversity hotspot - an area of high diversity and endemism under increasing threat. Although the largest remaining extent of these forests is reported to be found in Mozambique, very little is known on their extent, condition and composition here. In addition, the term 'coastal forest' has been used in different ways by different authors. This paper defines and characterises coastal dry forests found in northern Mozambique and assesses their present extent, botanical composition, conservation importance and the threats to these forests. Methods - The study area of 18,150 km2 lies in Cabo Delgado Province in north-east Mozambique, adjacent to Tanzania. Its limits are determined primarily by geological substrate and landform. Four smaller study sites were chosen covering a range of landforms. Manual interpretation of satellite imagery dating from 1999-2002 was used to calculate possible previous and present extent of 'dense vegetation'. Extensive field collecting was used in determining botanical composition and distribution patterns. IUCN Red List assessments were carried out on selected species using distributional criteria. Results - Dry forests similar to those in southern Tanzania are found widely scattered across coastal Cabo Delgado, sitting in a matrix of miombo woodland and other vegetation types. However, forest cover is not as extensive was believed. We calculate that the original extent of 'dense vegetation cover', which includes coastal dry forest, was 6087 km2. Owing to clearance over the last 150 years this is now only 1182 km2, of which perhaps only 400 km2 is moderately-intact dry forest. In this southern part of their range such forests are essentially dry, not moist and mesic, and dominated by a high proportion of deciduous or sclerophyllous evergreen trees. The plant species composition differs significantly from that of the surrounding woodlands. There is a marked change in species composition between forest patches along the coast, and they contain numerous species with restricted global distribution. Since 2003, 68 species new to Mozambique have been recorded from Cabo Delgado in addition to 36 possible new species. Many new records are of species previously only known from south-eastern Tanzania. Previously recorded patterns of restricted distribution and high species turnover between forest patches in Kenya and Tanzania are confirmed. Seven coastal forest species were assessed as Endangered. Regional context and conservation - Coastal dry forests are discussed in relation to the more widespread 'sand forests' of the continental interior of south-central Africa, and shown to have similarities in ecology, species composition, soils and ecology. Very little of the present extent of coastal forests in Mozambique lies within protected areas. The threats to their continued existence in the face of exploitation for timber, agriculture and oil exploration are outlined.",21.7722737601813,2,"plot, plant, tropic"

Prostephanus truncatus flight activity was consistently higher and the flight activity pattern significantly different near maize stores than at sites inside the forest. Although P. truncatus is known to infest girdled branches of Lannea nigritana (Sc. Elliot) Keay, the P. truncatus flight activity was comparatively low at forest sites where this tree species dominated. The main peak in P. truncatus flight activity occurred earlier in the eastern part of the forest compared with other forest parts. Ordination analysis showed that comparatively higher flight activity in the eastern part of the forest was positively associated with the presence of teak plantations (Tectona grandis L. F.) at trap sites. The spatial distribution of weekly P. truncatus trap catches were found to be significantly aggregated during a 21-wk period, which largely coincided with the early increase in P. truncatus flight activity in the eastern part of the forest. Based on this evidence, it was suggested that P. truncatus individuals disperse from the eastern part of the forest to other forest parts and to nearby agricultural areas, rather than, as has been previously suggested, from maize stores to the forest environment.","In South Africa, much of the forest biome is vulnerable to human-induced disturbance. The forest-dwelling butterfly Charaxes xiphares occidentalis is naturally confined to a small forest region in the south-western Cape, South Africa. Most of the remaining habitat of this species is within a fragmented agricultural matrix. Furthermore, this geographical area is also heavily invaded by alien plants, especially Acacia mearnsii . We investigated how C. x. occidentalis behaviourally responds to different habitat conditions in the landscape. We were particularly interested in touring, patrolling and settling behaviour as a conservation proxy for preference of a certain habitat configuration in this agricultural matrix. Remnant forest patches in the agricultural matrix showed fewer behavioural incidents than in a reference protected area. Moreover, dense stands of A. mearnsii negatively influenced the incidence and settling pattern of this butterfly across the landscape, with fewer tree settlings associated with more heavily invaded forest patches. This settling pattern was predominantly seen in female butterflies. We also identified specific trees that were settled upon for longer periods by C. x. occidentalis . Distance to a neighbouring patch and patch size influenced behavioural incidences, suggesting that further patch degradation and isolation could be detrimental to this butterfly. Conservation implications: We highlight the importance of clearing invasive tree species from vulnerable forest ecosystems and identify key tree species to consider in habitat conservation and rehabilitation programmes for this butterfly. We also suggest retaining as much intact natural forest as possible. This information should be integrated in local biodiversity management plans.","• With about a third of smallholder farmers reporting cultivating trees on their farms, trees are not uncommon in the five Sub-Saharan African countries studied. Fruit trees and tree cash crops (such as coffee, cacao, and cashew nuts) are the most frequent tree categories grown. • The prevalence of on-farm trees for timber is also sizable in Tanzania (18 percent of smallholders), but minimal or poorly recorded elsewhere. • In addition to sales, fruit trees are also commonly used for self-consumption in Ethiopia and Uganda, implying that they may play an important role in food security and nutrition. • Their contribution to income is not negligible—17 percent of total gross income among tree crop growers, and 6 percent on average across all rural households. • Tree-growing households are better off on average in most of the study countries. • Trees are more likely on larger farms, in warmer areas, and closer to forests. Their prevalence also appears to be shaped by national policies and institutional factors.","Abstract. Agricultural catchments in the tropics often generate high concentrations of suspended sediments following the conversion of natural ecosystems. The eroded fine particles are generally enriched with carbon (TC) and nutrients (TN and TP) originating from the topsoil of agricultural land. Sediment-associated TC, TN and TP are an important loss to the terrestrial ecosystem and tightly connected to an increase in riverine particulate TC and nutrient export. Soil nutrient depletion can limit crop growth and yields, whereas an excess of nutrients in streams can cause eutrophication in freshwater systems. Streams in East Africa, with widespread land conversion from forests to agriculture, are expected to receive high loads of sediment-associated TC, TN and TP. In this study, we assess the effect of land use on particulate TC, TN and TP concentrations. Suspended sediments (time-integrated, manual-event-based and automatic-event-based sediment samples) were analysed for TC, TN and TP concentrations collected at the outlet of a natural montane forest (35.9), a tea-tree plantation (33.3) and a smallholder agriculture (27.2 km2) catchment in western Kenya during a wet sampling period in 2018 and a drier sampling period in 2019. Particulate TC, TN and TP concentrations were up to 3-fold higher (p<0.05) in the natural forest catchment compared to fertilized agricultural catchments. However, because of higher sediment loads from the smallholder agriculture catchment, the total sediment-associated loads of TC, TN and TP were higher compared to the natural forest and tea-tree plantation catchment. The higher C:N ratios in the natural forest suggest that the particulate nutrients are of organic origin due to tighter nutrient cycles, whereas lower ratios in both agricultural catchments suggest a mixture of mineral and organic sediment sources. The findings of this study imply that with the loss of natural forest, the inherent soil fertility is progressively lost under the current low fertilization rates and soil management strategies.","Mangroves (stretch of intertidal tropical and subtropical forests between inland coastal forests and the sea) are being exploited at a rate that is unprecedented, there is loss of biodiversity because of conflicting and unsuitable uses. This study was aimed at promoting the protection of mangrove and associated coastal forests within Tiko and Limbe III municipalities in south western Cameroon, Central Africa via the contribution of buffer zone agroforestry. Representative traditionally dominant agricultural land use sites were surveyed for the identification and analysis of farming practices using participatory rapid appraisal (PRA). Data collected (qualitative and quantitative) were subjected to descriptive and inferential statistics. Out of twelve (12) agroforestry practices currently carried out by farmers under three widely dominant classic agroforestry systems (agri-silvicultural – plantation and non-plantation, silvo-pastoral and agri-silvo-pastoral systems), 5 of them under plantation and non-plantation systems (palms on crops lands, cocoa-based, rubber on crop lands, scattered trees on farmland and home gardens) were considered climate smart agroforestry practices. The maximum diameter, density, height and crown diameter of trees were dominant in the cocoa-based except for the mango-based which had the maximum tree height. The tree size class for poles (≥10cm to <30cm) was dominant in the 5 practices. For a more inclusive green economy and climate smart agriculture, some improvements on tree density, shade management and choice of multi-purpose trees species (Cedrela sepium, Moringa oleifera, Leucaena leucocephala and fruit trees) for vital functions such as firewood, soil improvement, medicine, food and construction are advocated to enhance sustainable exploitation of adjacent coastal forests thus protecting mangrove. Moreover, on account of resultant stable tree species, structural and use diversity of adjacent coastal forests, further make buffer agroforestry to hold promise for the conservation of fragile and vulnerable mangroves. There is therefore also need to expand the present study in other mangrove areas especially the mangroves of Cameroon Estuary which is the major deforestation hotspot in Cameroon.","Agricultural field trees constitute social nets for rural households in Burkina Faso. However, in recent decades they have been affected by climate variability, which has led to a significant reduction in the populations of dominant species such as shea and African locust within them. The objective of this study is therefore to determine the adaptation strategies developed by managers, as well as the factors influencing these strategies to cope with the changing environment. The methodology deployed for this purpose consists of primary and secondary data collection. Descriptive statistics and binary logistic regression were used to analyse the collected data. The study revealed that more than 70% of the tree managers are men and the majority of them are illiterate, with households of 5-15 children. In addition, more than 80% of the managers have agriculture as their main activity, and the size of their holdings is between 1ha and 10ha. Three strategies are used by tree managers in agricultural fields. The proactive strategy aims to anticipate the consequences of climate variability. The reactive strategy aims to react to the effects of climate variability. The strategy of silvicultural techniques consists of pruning, grafting and assisting the trees. However, the choice of strategies is influenced by the socio-economic characteristics of the respondents. For example, the proactive strategy is influenced by education level, household size and income from non-timber forest products. For the reactive strategy, the size of the holding and the level of education have an effect on the choice of strategy. For the silvicultural techniques strategy, age and education level have an impact on the choice of strategy. It is then up to the relevant authorities to work in the light of these results to initiate actions to strengthen the coping strategies of the people managing the trees in the agricultural fields.","Forests and other intact areas within the tropics are nowadays in the primary focus of researchers, while little or no attention is paid to urban sub-Saharan environments, justifying the need to gather baseline data. It is important to understand urban bird species ecology and uncover its interactions with city people. The speckled mousebird (SM, Colius striatus) is one of the most common species in rural and urban areas within man-made environments and is endemic to sub-Saharan Africa. We systematically sampled 222 random count points in Dschang (West Cameroon) using binoculars within buffers of a 50 m radius around the count points for 10 min, two times during the period of September–November 2022. The population density reached 1.33 ind./ha, and its distribution largely followed a random pattern. The presence of SM was positively correlated with the abundance of fruiting trees, with the most important being the percentage of guava (Psidium guajava) and papaya (Carica papaya) trees. Similarly, the presence of SM was positively linked to the size of human population, as it often occurred within mosaic agricultural areas and near dwellings. The percentage of feeding time increased around garbage sites due to the greater availability of nutrients for fruiting trees there. We further found a positive relationship between the percentage of feeding time and temperature, along with an increased number of vocal interactions around garbage sites. Our results showed that interactions between SM and humans were a significant driver of SM distribution within the study area.","Abstract Background The south of Benin, a country in West Africa, is still home to remnants of dense forests that benefit from a particularly rainy sub-equatorial climate, with annual rainfall of up to 1,200 mm. These forest ecosystems are an integral part of the West African forest block, which stretches from Liberia to Togo. However, despite their richness and ecological importance, these forests are unfortunately subject to strong human pressures, particularly from slash-and-burn agriculture, intensive logging and the growing urbanisation of coastal areas. Preserving these forests is crucial, however, as they are home to remarkable plant and animal biodiversity, with many endemic species. What's more, these forests play an essential role in regulating the local climate, protecting soil and water resources, as well as providing local populations with a vital source of energy wood, non-timber forest products and support for their traditional agricultural practices. Faced with these conservation challenges, identifying and characterising the main tree species found in the forests of southern and central Benin, forest species and their ecology is an essential prerequisite for implementing sustainable management and restoration strategies for these threatened forest ecosystems in southern Benin. This work aims to identify and draw attention to the different forest species, specially tree forest species present in southern and central Benin. New information The dataset provides information on forest species found in southern and central Benin, West Africa. This dataset is extremely useful for forestry research, as it focuses mainly on the various forest species of major importance. It can be used as a basis for characterising individuals or populations of species, based on their abundance in relation to anthropogenic pressure and changes in environmental conditions. These species are characteristic of forests and, above all, are of particular interest both to populations and to managers of protected areas. Field collections were initiated in 2007 as part of natural forest inventory work. The data collected have been completed by various field works that followed this work on forest species in southern Benin. The latest version of the dataset is publicly and freely accessible on the GBIF website at the address https://www.gbif.org/dataset/aff3a10a-a86b-4eff-98e4-d63f92fd6f7e. It should be noted that the fact that the collection and monitoring were carried out in southern Benin, a region known for its great diversity of species, over a period of 10 years making these data particularly relevant information to study the effects of climate change and human pressure on ecosystems in this area.","Abstract. Conversion of natural forest (NF) to other land uses could lead to significant changes in catchment hydrology, but the nature of these changes has been insufficiently investigated in tropical montane catchments, especially in Africa. To address this knowledge gap, we aimed to identify stream water (RV) sources and flow paths in three tropical montane sub-catchments (27–36 km2) with different land use (natural forest, NF; smallholder agriculture, SHA; and commercial tea and tree plantations, TTP) within a 1021 km2 catchment in the Mau Forest complex, Kenya. Weekly samples were collected from stream water, precipitation (PC) and mobile soil water for 75 weeks and analysed for stable isotopes of water (δ2H and δ18O) for mean transit time (MTT) estimation with two lumped parameter models (gamma model, GM; and exponential piston flow model, EPM) and for the calculation of the young water fraction. Weekly samples from stream water and potential endmembers were collected over a period of 55 weeks and analysed for Li, Na, Mg, K, Rb, Sr and Ba for endmember mixing analysis (EMMA). Solute concentrations in precipitation were lower than in stream water in all catchments (p < 0.05), whereas concentrations in springs, shallow wells and wetlands were generally more similar to stream water. The stream water isotope signal was considerably damped compared to the isotope signal in precipitation. Mean transit time analysis suggested long transit times for stream water (up to 4 years) in the three sub-catchments, but model efficiencies were very low. The young water fraction ranged from 13 % in the smallholder agriculture sub-catchment to 15 % in the tea plantation sub-catchment. Mean transit times of mobile soil water ranged from 3.2–3.3 weeks in forest soils and 4.5–7.9 weeks in pasture soils at 15 cm depth to 10.4–10.8 weeks in pasture soils at 50 cm depth. The contribution of springs and wetlands to stream discharge increased from a median of 16.5 (95 % confidence interval: 11.3–22.9), 2.1 (−3.0–24.2) and 50.2 (30.5–65.5) % during low flow to 20.7 (15.2–34.7), 53.0 (23.0–91.3) and 69.4 (43.0–123.9) % during high flow in the natural forest, smallholder agriculture and tea plantation sub-catchments, respectively. Our results indicate that groundwater is an important component of stream water, irrespective of land use. The results further suggest that the selected transit time models and tracers might not be appropriate in tropical catchments with highly damped stream water isotope signatures. A more in-depth investigation of the discharge dependence of the young water fraction and transit time estimation using other tracers, such as tritium, could therefore shed more light on potential land use effects on the hydrological behaviour of tropical montane catchments.","Baobab tree species plays a significant role in the livelihoods of rural dwellers in the Sahel regions. This study was carried out to analyze farmer’s perceptions on the impacts of Adansonia digitata L. leaves exploitation on its conservation and on livelihoods of local communities. Data were collected by interviewing 120 farmers to elucidate the impacts of leaves exploitation as well as the contribution of the species on their livelihoods. Descriptive statistics and multiple regression analysis were used to analyze the data to identify the annual contribution and to determine the socio-demographic characteristics influencing farmer’s perception of baobab leaves harvesting techniques. The results show that non-timber forest products (NTFPs) are the second pillar to support the respondents after agriculture. Their contribution European Scientific Journal, ESJ ISSN: 1857-7881 (Print) e ISSN 1857-7431 April 2021 edition Vol.17, No.13 www.eujournal.org 42 rate ranged between 4 and 7% in the study sites. The findings revealed that the annual income obtained per person from the exploitation of baobab leaves ranged from 33,714 FCFA (56.00 USD) to 52,857 FCFA (87.80 USD). Its contribution to annual household income varies between 2.51 and 5.4%. Two (used of machete and stick) out of the three (manual collection, used of machete and stick) methods used by farmers to harvest the baobab leaves, have negative impacts on baobab species conservation. Age, educational level, and gender are key factors influencing farmer’s perception of baobab leaves harvesting. In view of the importance of the baobab tree, it is imperative that the domestication and propagation of baobab trees should be supported through the adoption of improved agroforestry technologies. In addition, sustainable harvesting practices of baobab leaves is also recommended for the conservation of this species.",28.8531645180804,0,"water, protect, soil"

Employing a combination of machine learning and deep learning techniques, we developed a novel data fusion approach that integrated Digital Elevation Model (DEM) data, MODIS satellite imagery, WOSIS soil profile data, and CHELSA environmental data. This combined dataset, named GeoBlendMDWC, was specifically designed for SOC prediction. The primary aim of this research is to develop and evaluate a novel optimization algorithm for accurate SOC prediction by leveraging multi-source environmental data. Specifically, this study aims to (1) create an integrated dataset combining remote sensing and ground data for comprehensive SOC analysis, (2) develop a new optimization technique that enhances both machine learning and deep learning model performance, and (3) evaluate the algorithm’s efficiency and accuracy against established optimization methods like Jaya and GridSearchCV. This study focused on India, Australia, and South Africa, countries known for their significant agricultural activities. We introduced a novel optimization technique for both machine learning and deep neural networks, comparing its performance to established methods like the Jaya optimization technique and GridSearchCV. The models evaluated included XGBoost Regression, LightGBM, Gradient Boosting Regression (GBR), Random Forest Regression, Decision Tree Regression, and a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) model. Our research demonstrated that the proposed optimization algorithm consistently outperformed existing methods in terms of execution time and performance. It achieved results comparable to GridSearchCV, reaching an R2 of 90.16, which was a significant improvement over the base XGBoost model’s R2 of 79.08. In deep learning optimization, it significantly outperformed the Jaya algorithm, achieving an R2 of 61.34 compared to Jaya’s 30.04. Moreover, it was 20–30 times faster than GridSearchCV. Given its speed and accuracy, this algorithm can be applied to real-time data processing in remote sensing satellites. This advanced methodology will greatly benefit the agriculture and farming sectors by providing precise SOC predictions.","Tropical forests play an important role of storing significant quantities of carbon, both, aboveground and belowground. However, deforestation activities for various purposes, among them, agriculture and settlement, have continued to remove unknown quantities of biomass and carbon stocks across tropical forests of Africa. This study was conducted to estimate aboveground tree biomass (AGB), carbon stocks (AGCS) and carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2 e) among three vegetation cover types (wooded land, bushland and grassland) found in Mapfungautsi forest and to quantify the long-term estimated total AGB, AGCS and CO2 e lost due to deforestation activities in the forest (between the year 2000 and 2020). Data collection was conducted using remote sensing imagery, field measurements and an allometric equation. A total of 22 plots, each measuring 50m x50m were established across the three vegetation cover types where tree height, diameter at breast height, number of stems/ha and regeneration were measured. The collected data was analysed using EViews Version 10 software. Wooded land generally had the highest values across all the four tree growth variables followed by bushland and grassland. The average estimated AGB stored were 50.78t/ha, 14.7t/ha and 8.2 t/ha for wooded land, bushland and grassland respectively. From the 10632ha cleared over 20 years, losses amounting to an estimated mean total AGB, AGCS and CO2 e of 387669.53t, 182205.09t and 668692.69t respectively were observed. We conclude that quantifying and raising awareness about the lost AGB, AGCS and CO2 e among stakeholders will lead to the implementation of remedial action to replenish the lost biomass and carbon stocks.","Accurate estimates of cultivated area and crop yield are critical to our understanding of agricultural production and food security, particularly for semi-arid regions like the Sahel of West Africa, where crop production is mainly rain-fed and food security is closely correlated with the inter-annual variations in rainfall. Several global and regional land cover products, based on satellite remotely-sensed data, provide estimates of the agricultural land use intensity, but the initial comparisons indicate considerable differences among them, relating to differences in the satellite data quality, classification approaches, and spatial and temporal resolutions. Here, we quantify the accuracy of available cropland products across Sahelian West Africa using an independent, high-resolution, visually interpreted sample dataset that classifies all points across West Africa using a 2-km sample grid (~500,000 points for the study area). We estimate the “quantity” and “allocation” disagreements for the cropland class of eight land cover products in five Western Sahel countries (Burkina Faso, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, and Senegal). The results confirm that coarse spatial resolution (300 m, 500 m, and 1000 m) land cover products have higher disagreements in mapping the fragmented agricultural landscape of the Western Sahel. Earlier products (e.g., GLC2000) are less accurate than recent products (e.g., ESA CCI 2013, MODIS 2013 and GlobCover 2009). We also show that two of the finer spatial resolution maps (GFSAD30, and GlobeLand30) using advanced classification approaches (random forest, decision trees, and pixel-object combined) are currently the best available products for cropland identification. However, none of the eight land cover databases examined is consistent in reaching the targeted 75% accuracy threshold in the five Sahelian countries. The majority of currently available land cover products overestimate cultivated areas by an average of 170% relative to the cropland area in the reference data.","The Mediterranean Region currently faces major environmental issues that require constant analysis and monitoring. This study presents a thorough approach based on the application of Landsat imagery from Global Forest Change during 2001–2019. Spatial distribution mapping was one of the objectives of the study. We approached the analysis of tree cover loss areas by analyzing the cumulative tree cover loss and Tree Cover Loss Rate. This indicator offers information about the trend of tree cover loss in each Mediterranean country. A total of 581 Mha of deforested area was mapped during the analyzed period. Analysis was further supplemented by some statistical operations (distributions shown via histograms, validation via Shapiro–Wilk normality test, and testing via one-sample t-test). Agricultural expansion, intense forest fires, illegal logging, overgrazing (especially in the northern part of Africa), and extensive livestock farming have influenced the Mediterranean forest ecosystem’s stability. The continuation of these activities could cause extreme climatic events, severe degradation, and desertification.","A multitemporal dataset of medium-resolution imagery was used to document a tree cover loss process in three forest reserves of Zambia. This degradation process was attributed to charcoal production with a high degree of certainty, as evidence of kiln scars was found in more than 85% of sites sampled with high-resolution imagery across the study areas. The spatial and temporal pattern of mapped kiln scars exposed an intense and fast-paced degradation process, with kiln densities reaching 2.3 kiln/ha, removal of about 79.3% of the aboveground biomass and reductions of 74.2% of tree cover. The analysis revealed that this forest degradation process progressively moves further away from urban centers. In the year 2010, charcoal production took place around 190 km away from Lusaka, whereas extraction areas in 2020 were located around 350 km from this city. These results underline the negative impact of charcoal production on forest resources and question its characterization as localized and periurban. The post-disturbance LCLUC trajectories of degraded woodlands in forest reserves revealed a partial conversion to agricultural land over time, with less than 25% of these woodlands cultivated seven years after charcoal production. The disaggregation of the supply sources of charcoal for the city of Lusaka based on consumption figures and remote sensing deforestation records showed that the charcoal generated as a byproduct of agricultural expansion is not enough to meet the annual charcoal demand of Lusaka. On the contrary, the majority (65%) of this charcoal is the result of a forest degradation process that alters 197.4 km2 of miombo woodlands annually. These findings highlight the role of charcoal production as a direct driver of forest degradation and suggest that forest degradation resulting from charcoal production has surpassed deforestation due to agricultural expansion as the main tree cover loss process in Zambia. These results provide data-driven evidence to improve the characterization of forest degradation resulting from charcoal production across the woodlands of southern Africa and aid the REDD + monitoring, reporting and verification systems in compliance with international reporting commitments.","Abstract. Addressing hunger is one of the greatest unsolved challenges Humanity has ever faced. Africa is one of the most fragile ecosystems strongly affected by numerous factors ranging from climate change, increasing population, decreasing water resources, and undeveloped hydrological infrastructure. These factors make it exceptionally vulnerable to food insecurity. The purpose of this study was to establish the feasibility and methodology of using Open Data Cube (ODC) and conventional machine learning algorithms to determine the extent of decrease in cropped area in the desert climate of Djibouti, the smallest Horn of Africa country (by landmass) over a thirty-year period. The research question was answered using Landsat 5, 7, and 8 imagery taken during the month of June from 1990, 2000, 2010, and 2020 then classified through machine learning algorithms - including decision tree and random forest. The data acquisition, analysis, and modeling were completed in an Open Data Cube environment using a cloud-based user computational platform running completely in-browser, and all necessary software was provided as part of the environment. The research identified a decreasing trend in vegetative areas but was limited in determining whether the vegetative areas were purely agricultural cropland in nature or included native vegetation. While the research reveals a concerning decline in total vegetation over the thirty-year period, the lack of other data variables (such as weather and climate patterns) provides too narrow a picture to determine causation. Several areas for further research are outlined.","Rain-fed farming is the primary livelihood of semi-arid west Africa. Changes in land cover have the potential to affect precipitation, the critical resource for production. Turbulent flux measurements from two eddy-covariance towers and additional observations from a dense network of small, wireless meteorological stations combine to relate land cover (savanna forest and agriculture) to evaporation in a small (3.5km2) catchment in Burkina Faso, west Africa. We observe larger sensible and latent heat fluxes over the savanna forest in the headwater area relative to the agricultural section of the watershed all year. Higher fluxes above the savanna forest are attributed to the greater number of exposed rocks and trees and the higher productivity of the forest compared to rain-fed, hand-farmed agricultural fields. Vegetation cover and soil moisture are found to be primary controls of the evaporative fraction. Satellite-derived vegetation index (NDVI) and soil moisture are determined to be good predictors of evaporative fraction, as indicators of the physical basis of evaporation. Our measurements provide an estimator that can be used to derive evaporative fraction when only NDVI is available. Such large-scale estimates of evaporative fraction from remotely sensed data are valuable where ground-based measurements are lacking, which is the case across the African continent and many other semi-arid areas. Evaporative fraction estimates can be combined, for example, with sensible heat from measurements of temperature variance, to provide an estimate of evaporation when only minimal meteorological measurements are available in remote regions of the world. These findings reinforce local cultural beliefs of the importance of forest fragments for climate regulation and may provide support to local decision makers and rural farmers in the maintenance of the forest areas.","Spatial time-series measurements of forest degradation rates are important for estimating national greenhouse gas emissions but have been challenging for open forests and woodlands. This lack of quantitative data on forest degradation rates, location and biomass is an important constraint to developing national REDD+ policy. In Malawi, and in most countries in Africa, most assessments of forest cover change for carbon emissions monitoring tend to report only deforestation in the public forest estate managed by the government, even when important forest degradation also occurs in agricultural areas, such as customary forests and other tree-based systems. This study has resulted in: (a) a new robust forest map for Malawi, (b) spatial and quantitative measurements of both forest degradation and deforestation, and (c) a demonstration of the approach through the introduction of a tool that maps across the broad landscape of forests and trees outside of forests. The results can be used to support REDD+ National Forest Monitoring Systems. This analysis produces new estimates of landscape-wide deforestation rates between 2000–2009 (22,410 ha yr−1) and 2009–2015 (38,937 ha yr−1). We further produce new estimates of the rate of forest degradation between 2000–2009 (42,961 ha yr−1) and 2009–2015 (71,878 ha yr−1). The contribution of these new tools and estimates to capacities for calculating carbon emissions are important, increasing prospects for full REDD+ readiness across semi-arid Africa.","To contribute to the development of methods for the sustainable management of forest ecosystems in Central Africa, the following research question was addressed: can analyses of land cover change help to understand and document the spatial organization and mechanisms of forest degradation? To answer this question in the Democratic Republic of Congo, the Makala project mapped the tree and forest resources of Kinshasa's wood-fuel supply basin and attempted to predict how they would evolve in the future. Maps were made for four periods (1984, 2001, 2006 and 2012) using a mosaic of four LANDSAT images. The above-ground biomass was estimated in 2012 using forest inventories in 317 plots distributed across the four types of plant cover found on the Bateke plateau (4,337 trees and 44 species were recorded). This inventory data combined with the satellite data allowed us to make the first comprehensive assessment of above-ground biomass in the study area. Between 2000 and 2012, the average volume of wood-fuel fell by more than 50%. Over the entire period studied (1984 to 2012), carbon stocks fell by 75%. In the wood-fuel supply area for Kinshasa, the drastic loss of forest cover, shortened fallow periods, savannah encroachment and the decline of biomass and carbon stocks are clear signals of degradation. However, these initial estimations were derived from a small sample that was extrapolated to the entire supply area. It would be very useful to increase sampling in order to obtain more accurate and realistic figures. The experience of the Makala project clearly shows that the analysis of land cover change helps to understand and document the spatial organization and mechanisms of forest degradation. However, only with a sound wood-fuel resource policy and sustainable community land management, combined with very dynamic tree reintroduction on agricultural land, will it be possible to initiate a sustainable process of restoration.

The name of centre represents common and interesting genus of plants which is distributed from Northern Africa across Europe to the polar latitudes. The aim of the Papaver Centre is to develop ties within the interdisciplinary team consisting of paleoecologists, archaeologists, and vegetation ecologists in order to create an effective space for the study of climatic, cultural as well as landscape changes. This paper describes recent educational and scientific activities of the centre. One of main results is realization series of international lectures of top scientists, which substantially improved capabilities of members in the Laboratory of Archaeobotany and Palaeoecology.

The research centre bears the name of the genus of poppies (Papaver), the representatives of which are distributed from the coldest areas on Svalbard to the warmest of northern Africa, and thus represents the region targeted by the project’s research interests. 2. Papaver Centre and research development in 2013–2015 In accord with the project’s idea to create conditions for top science, the members of the Papaver team actively contributed to the scientific goals of their different projects. The synergy between several active research grants and the Papaver project was extraordinarily useful. The support has enabled interdisciplinary space to be created for several specific palaeoecological, archaeobotanical and botanical research tasks. The Papaver project has been led by the head of the centre, archaeologist and archaeobotanist Jaromír Beneš, and the scientific supervisor for the whole team, botanist and vegetation ecologist Karel Prach. The Papaver team itself has been organized into three thematic panels. The paleoecological group, led by J. Novák, has integrated and organized activities connected with a multi-proxy approach focused on the reconstruction of the Holocene vegetation changes in terms of vegetation, climate, and human impact upon environmental changes throughout Europe (Bešta et al. 2015). Up to now the scholars involved in the Papaver project have contributed into many multi-proxy palaeoecological and archaeobotanical studies in central Europe (Hlásek et al. 2014; Hlásek et al. 2015; Chvojka et al. 2014; Pokorná et al. 2014). The attention of the project has also been focused on the anthracological research at many important archaeological sites (Novák 2014a; Novák 2014b). Anthracology is an effective method for the study of macrovegetation in the landscape (trees and shrubs). Other anthracological studies highlight the importance of pedoanthracological research for the reconstruction of woodland history; for example, in the sandstone area of North Bohemia (Prostředník et al. 2014). The environmental archaeology group has been led by J. Beneš. This panel has focused on research into the Mesolithic/Neolithic transition in central Europe; however, the younger post Neolithic periods of human impact on nature in prehistoric Bohemia and Moravia have not been omitted. The aim of the Papaver team has also been to investigate Mesolithic hunter-gatherers through a broad interdisciplinary approach. The members have participated in a range of archaeological excavations, occuring in certain regions of the Czech Republic, namely the Třeboň basin in south Bohemia, and the north Bohemian pseudokarst area of Bohemian Paradise (Šída et al. 2014; Divišová, Šída 2015). Apart from the excavations themselves and artefact analyses, a number of palaeoecological and archaeobotanical analyses have formed integral components of the research. A variety of questions regarding former human behaviour, environment, plant use, human impact on the landscape, etc., are being investigated using the tools of environmental archaeology, such as pollen analysis or analysis of plant macroremains. In addition, the issue of the last hunter-gatherers in the region and their transition to farming, which is of special importance, has been addressed by examining specific sites together with artefactual and ecofactual material recovered from sediments dated from the Mesolithic onwards. A second connection between environmental archaeology and archaeobotany has been created in the case of the Bronze Age period and Early Iron Age period in south Bohemia. The aim of our research has been the notification of current macro-remains analysis of the prehistory cultural sediments in the region of South Bohemia. The analysed assemblage consists of a cluster of sites dated in a time span from the Late Neolithic to the Early Iron Age period. The samples have been obtained during the course of salvage, as well as scholarly, excavations between the years 2005 and 2015 (Šálková et al. 2014). In our research, macroremains analysis represents another source of interpretation of archaeological features, infills, and cultural layers, and makes possible the reconstruction of the palaeoeconomy of settlement areas (e.g. housing, economy, structure of utility plants and weeds, burial rites), as well as the natural environment in the background of human sites (e.g. Šálková et al. 2015; Hlásek et al. 2014; Chvojka et al. 2014; Hlásek et al. 2015; Fröhlich et al. 2014). The third direction of research in the environmental archaeology panel has been the study of the relationship of plants and humans in the medieval period and Early Modern Age in historical Czech lands. The archaeobotanical attractiveness of such research in these relatively young periods is that it increases a direct and unmistakable link to the present we live in now. This is especially obvious in the comparative research into the development and changes in individual types of cereals used during the malting process and subsequent brewing between the 13th and 18th centuries. As a result, we have managed to penetrate specific production processes, and the qualitative and quantitative aspects of brewing and malting before the advent of modern technology (Kočár et al. 2015). Medieval and Early Modern agriculture as a cardinal factor in the transformation of landscape and humaninduced changes in vegetation has been under the focus of Papaver Centre members. In the case of terraced fields in Malonín (South Bohemia), we have established a new methodology in how to date such changes (Houfková et al. 2015). Thanks to another research grant, we have performed archaeological excavations of the long-stripped fields in the abandoned village Malonín. Our approach has consisted of a combination of information from different sources such as historical documents and maps, chronologies based on the dating of archaeological artefacts, 14C data, and the assignment of 210Pb, 137Cs concentrations. Our results have proved that the current pattern of field margins in the former village of Malonín is High Medieval in origin.

Centre for Human and Plant Studies of Postglacial Europe and Northern Africa, 2013–2015 115 recent landscape patterns in many villages in marginal areas of central Europe can be based on man-made structures originating in the Medieval Period, we conclude that the memory of the medieval landscape remains very strong. Our results have provided arguments for the preservation of such defined landscape units; this could lead to a conservation of both long-term historical pattern and recent biodiversity bound to its exact combination of landscape elements. The issue of the Medieval and the Early Modern economy and ecology in historical towns has also been very attractive. Members of the Papaver Centre have studied two sites: Písek-Bakaláře (the Medieval secondarily filled-in well; Šálková et al. 2015) and České Budějovice, Krajinská street 7 (the Medieval cesspit; Čapek et al. 2015). In those times wells were very often secondarily used as cesspits: because of water contamination or changes in water regimes. Various aspects of human life and behaviour have been reflected in the waste disposal and storage inside “Well 1” in PísekBakaláře. It has been possible to detect imported material of different origins and to reconstruct the environment of the town’s background (meadows, fields, gardens, forests), as well as animal rearing (cattle, sheep, pig, horse, dog, cat), crops grown (cereals and fruits), and waste management practices (Šálková et al. 2015). The faecal infill of the cesspit in České Budějovice, Krajinská 7 was characterised by the macroremains of utility plants which reflected the food strategy of medieval burghers (Čapek et al. 2015). Since the Early Modern world was not only about production but also about consumption, a pilot study on the everyday life of selected “consumers” in the south Bohemian town of Czech Krumlov (UNESCO) has been created with an emphasis on the reconstruction of the eating habits of townspeople during the 17th century (Preusz et al. 2014), using the testimony of archival sources, archaeology, archaeobotany and archaeozoology. Our investigation has revealed that changes in the traditional stereotypical diet and social customs have crystallized over the centuries, and has opened","Genetic modification has gotten a hostile reception from activists who claim to be protecting the planet. But the most powerful underlying emotion for their unreasoned fear—rapid human population growth—is rapidly becoming irrelevant. Will biotechnology overcrowd the planet by saving more sick people while producing more food to fuel more population growth? In a word, no. The opposition of the eco-activists is ironic, at least. Without the Green Revolution's high-yield farming, the world would already have had to clear most or all of its 16 million square miles of forests to produce today's food supply. Plant breeding, chemical fertilizers, irrigation pumps, and pesticides have been the key technologies to date in “growing more food per acre to leave more room for nature.” But each of these advances in farming has been pilloried by activist groups who claim to fear insect-protected cotton (that helps prevent devastation of the textile-dependent economies in China and India), vitamin-A-enriched “golden” rice (to prevent blindness in poor Asian children), and blight-resistant potatoes (that could prevent a re-enactment of the Irish potato famine in potato-dependent Bangladesh). Why are these people not joyful about the conservation benefits of high-yield farming? Apparently because they fear growing more food will mean even larger human populations. Fearing overpopulation was understandable in the 1960s, when the Green Revolution was suddenly tripling Asian crop yields and DDT began preventing millions of malaria deaths. Today, however, the world is 40 years into the first era when bigger harvests mean better nutrition for children instead of more people. The world's population surge is losing its steam, even though the number of people added each year is still near all-time highs. In a completely unexpected development, world birth rates per women have plummeted as radically as death rates in the era of modern medicine. Third world birth rates have come three-fourths of the way to stability, having dropped from 6.2 births per women in 1960 to 3.1 today. (Stability is 2.1.) This trend in birth rates is massive and unprecedented. The UN Population Division has just—again—lowered its estimate of the peak human population, this time to between 8 and 9 billions. (We are at 6.3 billions now.) Poor farmers almost always have big families, but affluent urban couples almost always have two children or less. The entire world (except Africa) is now on the path to urban affluence. Africa, eventually, will find its way along the same path. The eco-activists seem equally unaware that the UN Environmental Program's new Atlas of Biodiversity notes the world lost only half as many species (a combined 20 birds, mammals, and fish) to extinction in the last third of the 20th century as in the last third of the 19th century. Why the dramatic improvement? In the 19th century, man was clearing lots of forest to plant more low-yield crops. Today, we are raising yields and planting high-yield tree plantations for our lumber needs. Meanwhile, the World Conservation Union (IUCN) worries most about the one billion poor people living in the world's biodiversity hot spots, and trying to feed their families by hunting bushmeat and slash-and-burn farming. Only biotechnology is likely to provide new answers to the needs of these third world peasant farmers. But won't more (and more affluent) people inevitably take more resources away from nature? Again, no. Stone-age hunters had to exploit natural resources. That is why they eradicated dozens of mammal and bird species in North America, including our horses, camels, and ground sloths. Today, biotechnology can create new resources. Bacillus thuringiensis varieties are producing 80 percent more cotton per acre in India and 80 percent more corn per acre in the Philippines because they deal more effectively with the potentially ruinous tropical pests. That effectively creates more cropland. Biotechnology tomatoes can grow in far saltier water, which effectively creates new water supplies. The eco-activists propose to “solve” the food problem by subtracting resources, most notably the 80 million tons of natural nitrogen that conventional farmers take from the air each year to make “chemical” fertilizer for their crops. Organic farming, ardently promoted by the environmentalists, bans “synthetic” nitrogen. The world would need the manure from another 7 to 8 billion cattle (and 3 to 30 acres of forage per beast) to supply all-organic nitrogen today, and far more by 2050. The organic “solution” would immediately force us to clear virtually all the world's wildlands to grow clover—or doom one-third of the world's human population. Apparently, the eco-activists would like to solve the competition for land between people and wildlife by eliminating people. But in the 21st century, with rising farm productivity and rapidly declining birth rates, setting the needs of people and wildlife needlessly against each other is both inhumane and environmentally irresponsible. Genetic engineering, both in medicine and agriculture, is good for people and the planet.","Mankind is thought to have separated from a common ancestor shared with chimpanzees approximately 7 million years ago.1 At the time, among our ancestors was a group that decided to come down from the trees to live in the savanna as desertification of Africa's forests progressed. Although the term “ape-man” was used for early mankind who walked on two feet, improvements in the precision of dating methods and excavations from the latter half of the 20th century made it clear that many types of human species coexisted. Thus, the term “ape-man” is now only rarely used. Bipedalism was likely something attempted by many groups, and although many theories exist, the underlying reason for this transition is unclear.2 However, the advantages are clear – it enabled viewing vast distances and the use of hands to carry food, and ultimately led to the expansion of brain size. Interestingly, it took our ancestors an additional 4 million years to expand their brain size. This evolutionary delay might have been caused by climate changes in Africa. The progressively drying climate led to reductions in forestland, and our ancestors who lived on the plains were subjected to a new type of natural selection pressure, causing changes in their physique and behavior. One possible reason that orangutans remained in the trees when transported to Asia by continental drift was that although Africa and the Northern hemisphere began to dry and cool from approximately 30 million to 2.5 million years ago, Asia's forests in the tropical regions remained intact. Evidence of brain size expansion and the use of tools can be found from approximately 2.5 million years ago. Mankind at this stage is referred to as Homo habilis or Homo rudolfensis. The concept of pre-adaptation refers to gradually altering physique in advance so that it works to one's advantage once subjected to a particular environment. For instance, the advantages of walking erect are thought to have played an important role in the evolution of mankind much later; that is, approximately 2.5 million years later. The expansion of brain size also brought about a revolution in food energy, which accompanied the use of stone tools – the ability to ingest high caloric and nutritious meat products. Although they were “meat-eating” and hunted herbivorous animals on occasion, their meat supply likely came from food left over by carnivorous animals. In addition to increasing meat-eating efficiency, the expansion of brain size was accompanied by acquisition of modern man's physique, an expanded range of activity and loss of body hair. Although many human species remained in Africa, one group, the Peking man or Java man (also known as Homo erectus) moved to Eurasia approximately 1.8 million years ago in an event referred to as the first African exodus. At least one group of Homo erectus began using fire, a monumental event in mankind's history. Homo erectus existed until 250 000 years ago. We enter the age of modern man from approximately 200 000 years ago. The Neanderthals were another species of man that coexisted with modern humans during this period. This period saw the use of symbols, language and original art-forms. One group of modern humans left Africa approximately 100 000 years ago, and eventually adapted to all global environments in an event famously known as the second African exodus. Many terrains were conquered, including grasslands, deserts and mountains, and humans began living under various climates (tropical, temperate and polar). The conquering of various terrains is evidenced by the existence of Eskimos in polar regions, Bushmen in the deserts, Pygmies in the tropical rain forests, and Tibetan highlanders. The spreading of humans was particularly fast, with humans reaching Europe, Asia, North and South America, and Australia within the span of tens of thousands of years. Mankind at the time formed small nomadic groups and lived as hunter-gatherers. From a modest population of approximately 100 000 about 1 million years ago, the global population dramatically increased to 500 000 about 200 000 years ago, and further to approximately 10 million with the advent of agriculture about 10 000 years ago.3","The article examines the perspectives of summit diplomacy in relations between Russia and the countries of the African region. Summit diplomacy in the context of this article can be considered as an integral part of multi-vector network diplomacy, which is an effective addition, and sometimes an alternative to traditional diplomacy, despite the fact that officials also take part in the summits. The authors note that in studies on the diplomacy of summits, insufficient attention is paid to the substantive aspects of the relations between their participants. Thus, the summits imply consideration of a wide range of tasks, including those of a domestic political nature. At the same time, as an instrument of foreign policy, the effectiveness of summit diplomacy depends not only on the structural characteristics of relations, but also on the dynamics of interaction between the participants. The countries of the African region have rich mineral deposits, vast areas that could potentially be suitable for highly productive agriculture; forests, including the most valuable species of trees, as well as a huge population, which can become the basis for one of the world's largest markets for goods and services. It is African countries that occupy the first places in terms of GDP growth prospects and the rapidly growing economy as a whole. Transnational corporations have long been fighting for control over resources, access to cheap labor and the population's money, increasing their presence on the continent. In this regard, Africa has become the object of special attention of leading international players, including Russia. Thus, at present, a certain return of Russia's real interest in Africa is being ascertained. In the first part of the article, the authors analyze the economic opportunities of Russia and its main interests in relations with the countries of the African region. The second part deals with the development of Africa and the negotiating agenda of African states. The third part deals with new points of growth and promising areas of interaction between Russia and Africa.","The paper aims at interpreting inter-linkages between environmental changes and rural out-migration and at assessing their impacts on quality of life of rural women with a case illustration of Upper Kosi Catchment, Uttarakhand Himalayas, India. The results indicate that the availability of water, fuel-wood and fodder decreased, agricultural production declined and livelihood opportunities were reduced mainly due to depletion of natural resources. Consequently, the male out-migration increased by 15% during 1981–2011. This increased workload of women by 25%, more than 40% women are under severe threat of a variety of health risks generated mainly due to excess work-load, under-nourishment and lack of hygiene and sanitation. Key-words: Primary resource developers, ecosystem services, climate change, food and livelihood security, sanitation and health, sustainable development, India, Himalayas. 78 P. C. Tiwari • B. Joshi members of the family (Maithani 1996). On the other hand, there is severe shortage of adult male labour to work in agriculture and other sectors of rural economy which further acts as a drag on agricultural productivity and retards the process of socio-economic development in the mountains. The cumulative impact of all these physical, socio-economic and cultural constraints in the mountains is leading to grinding poverty, hardship, constant fear of insecurity, a feeling of helplessness, and complete dependence on the outside help. The environment thus created is not conducive to attaining the goals of sustainable mountain development (Maithani 1996; Joshi and Tiwari 2013). During the recent past a variety of changes has emerged in traditional resource utilization pattern mainly in response to the population growth and resultant increased demand of natural resources, and to the global change, particularly economic globalisation, urbanization and climate change in the Himalayas (IOM 2008; Jain and Nagarwalla 2004; Tiwari and Joshi 2012a). Women experience these changes differently and disproportionately and respond to them in a varying manner because of socially constructed gender relations and environmental sensitivity of mountain ecosystems. They make use of their critical traditional knowledge of and experience with natural resource management and adapting agricultural and food systems to multiple drivers of environmental change, including climate change, globalisation and economic processes, out-migration, and land-use changes in mountain environments, which helped women to become an important agent of sustainable mountain development (ICIMOD 2011). However, these changes have exerted sharply accentuated pressures on local economy through depletion of land, water, biodiversity and forests resources, collapsing conventional production system and increasing community vulnerability to livelihood and food insecurity and increased risks of natural disasters (World Bank 2009; Lonergan 1998). This has augmented male out-migration, and consequently increased hardships of rural women and deteriorated their quality of life (Mamgain 2003; Tiwari and Joshi 2012b). Conceptual Background Mountains have long been marginalized from the view point of sustainable development of their resources and inhabitants. However, during the recent years our understanding about the problems of mountain regions and approach to their development has undergone drastic changes (ICIMOD 2010). This is reflected by a deepening anxiety over the depletion of natural resources and disruption of mountain ecosystem services. As a result, the significance of mountain social-ecological systems was acknowledged for the first time on a global scale in Agenda 21 of the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED), held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in 1992 (UN 2012). Mountains include some of the most fragile ecosystems on the planet (ICIMOD 2010) as they are highly sensitive to changes caused by natural as well as anthropogenic factors (Sonesson and Messerli 2002). The drivers of changes range from a variety on natural hazards and disasters to a series of human-induced processes such as population growth, depletion of natural resources, urbanization, economic globalisation and resultant intensification of land use (Tiwari 2000; ICIMOD 2011). Moreover, changing climatic conditions have put pressure on the mountain environments through higher mean annual temperatures and melting of glaciers and snow, altered precipitation patterns, and more frequent and extreme weather events 79 Environmental Changes, Rural Out-migration and Social Dynamics in Himalayas which are likely to intensify the impacts of other natural as well as socio-economic drivers of change (IPCC 2007; UNEP-WCMC 2002; CIDA 2002; Brody et al. 2008; Daley 2011). Subsistence agriculture, livestock raising and income generation through small scale trade, and wage and casual labour constitute the main source of livelihood of mountain communities (Leduc and Shrestha 2008). The Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) of the United Nations has identified more than 75% of the land surface of the world’s mountain as unsuitable or marginally suitable for agriculture (Huddleston and Ataman 2003; Messerli and Ives 1997; IFAD 2001). It has been observed that the proportion of poor and vulnerable people increases with elevation (Huddleston and Ataman 2003). There are indications that poverty inequality between mountain people and those living in other areas is currently increasing (ICIMOD 2010). Approximately, 271 million people, which accounts for nearly 40% of the mountain population in developing and transition countries, have been estimated to be highly vulnerable to food insecurity, specifically in Asia and Latin America (Huddleston and Ataman 2003; FAO 2008). High dependency on natural resources and increasing marginalisation are some of important factors for prevailing poverty, food and livelihood insecurity and poor community health, in mountains of developing countries which are further increasing their vulnerability to long-term impacts of global environmental changes (Huddleston and Ataman 2003). The globalizing economy has both positive as well as negative impacts on the mountain livelihoods and economy. The fast growing tourism industry in India, China and Nepal has opened new opportunities for the growth of mountain economy. Furthermore, China and India are the fastest growing economies in Asia, yet, they have the highest poverty ratios. Moreover, the economic globalisation have further increased the vulnerability of the mountain communities to the environmental risks through exploitation of natural resources even in remote and inaccessible areas, particularly in the developing countries. This seems to have further deepened poverty imbalances between highlands and lowlands (Hassan et al. 2005; Huddleston and Ataman 2003). However, for millennia the mountain communities were developing distinctive mechanisms to adapt to these typical conditions through evolving a range of adaptive measures (UNEP 2004; ICIMOD 2010). Migration of male youth is one the important adaptive measures to constraints of subsistence economy and changing environmental conditions and associated natural and socio-economic risks across all the mountain regions of the world (Sherpa 2007). On one hand, labour migration improves economic conditions and ensures food security in terms of remittance (Kollmair et al. 2006); on the other hand, it has inadvertently created a vacuum in the mountain societies, putting extra responsibilities on women (Sherpa 2007). During 1991–2000, the level of adult male out-migration in the mountainous regions of South Asia exceeded 40% (Rasmussen and Parvez 2002). Draining away of productive human resource from mountains has serious implications not only for the economic development, but also for the enrichment of socio-cultural life in the region (Maithani 1996). Women, being natural resource developers, possess undocumented indigenous knowledge, and their contribution towards preserving the mountain cultures and natural resources is highly significant (ICIMOD 1999). However, the depletion of natural resource base has affected women adversely by increasing their workload and marginality (UNDP 2010). As a result, women play crucial role in mountain societies as major work force in food production system and as key players in the conservation and management of natural re80 P. C. Tiwari • B. Joshi sources and environments (FAO 2010, 2011). Globally, women share is nearly 43% of the work force in agricultural sector, and mountain regions of Asia, Africa, and Latin America it is above 50% (Sherpa 2007). The combined hardship and adversity of mountain living conditions trained the women to respond radically to the forces that were exploiting their natural resources and undermining their livelihoods. Rural women’s active participation in the conservation and management of their natural resources laid the foundation for the well known environmental movements in the seventies (Verma 2001). The famous 'Chipko Movement' (hugging the trees movement) of Uttarakhand – a distinctly non-violent grassroots movement – was organized and lead by illiterate rural women against the exploitative state forestry policy in 1970s. However, women in the Himalayas are particularly vulnerable to the impacts of environmental changes due to skewed power relations and inequitable cultural and social norms, as a result, they are often disadvantaged in terms of power relations and accessing resources, and exposed to increased risks associated with environmental changes (ICIMOD 2010). These risks include further marginalization, exclusion from decision-making and dislocation from access to resources for survival. Women generally have far less access to and control over the resources they manage and conserve (Sherpa 2007). The women of the Hindu Kush Himalayas of Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, China","Review: Old Fields: Dynamics and Restoration of Abandoned Farmland Viki A. Cramer and Richard J. Hobbs (Eds.) Reviewed by Joan Ellen Broome Georgia Southern University, USA Cramer, Viki A. and Richard J. Hobbs (Eds.). Old Fields: Dynamics and Restoration of Abandoned Farmland. Washington, D.C.: Island Press, 2007. 334 pp. ISBN 1597260754. US$40.00, paper. Recycled, acid free paper. The editors of Old Fields compiled what is the first international synthesis of research on the dynamics of land abandonment, whether it is former cropland, pasturage, or tree plantations. This alone makes it a laudable achievement. Both editors, Viki A. Cramer and Richard J. Hobbs, are affiliated with Murdoch University in Western Australia. Cramer is an ecologist in the School of Environmental Science where she teaches environmental restoration while Richard J. Hobbs is a fellow both there and at the Australian Academy of Science and serves as editor-in-chief of the journal Restoration Ecology. Together, in the first two chapters, they offer an overview of the body of work to date and outline the theoretical principles based on them. The case studies follow. Questions raised deal with the worldwide process of land abandonment and whether or not predictable patterns arise regardless of location. The post abandonment questions reckon with whether or not the dynamics of plant succession that follow once cultivated landscapes are peculiar to the locale or exhibit recognizable patterns globally. Why must these processes be investigated? Because understanding abandonment and post abandonment dynamics powerfully influence restoration ecology decisions. It is a useful work for scientists, practitioners and students of ecology. The interested generalist should await further synthesizing and a less technical approach. Cramer and Hobbs remind us that land abandonment is nothing new in human history. But the most recent version of it since records have been kept is instructive. The eastern U.S. became “the first region [on the planet] to experience significant abandonment of cropland from 1870 onward” (p. 3-5). The modern day experience in land abandonment has several causes. Among them are shifts in the demand for commodities in the world market that make a once intensely cultivated crop unprofitable; population explosions requiring human habitat development of former agricultural properties; intermittent environmental cataclysms like long term droughts; and long term abuses in production practices that led to catastrophes like deforestation. The research conducted covers a wide range of topographies. Case studies included are from Puerto Rico, Brazilian Amazonia, Australian Rain Forests, arid landscapes in Southeastern Spain and central Greece, shrub land in South Africa, and Michigan flatlands and the Piedmont area of New Jersey in the United States. One lapse in the book is the failure to mention one of the largest and dramatic restoration proposals in the U.S., which is also known as the “home of old fields ecology.” In the late 1980s, a super-sized restoration plan for the Great Plains poetically labeled “The Buffalo Commons” by the staid academicians who conceived it captured national headlines. The pair of scientists who devised this plan werefrom Rutgers University: Frank (international land use expert) and Deborah (geographer) Popper. The Poppers addressed their restoration plan at a conference of the Society for Ecological Restoration International in Chicago in June of 1990, where the couple and the concept (now accepted by initially hostile plains residents) received a warm welcome. The editors’ end chapter offers much to ponder as restoration ecology moves into new terrain, literally. Cramer and Hobbs observe that there are actually instances where restoration is not advisable. They rightly conclude that the models developed thus far were in “temperate areas of the Northern Hemisphere” and may not apply in the other regions featured in some of these case studies. In areas where intense cultivation followed by abandonment are recent, restoration based on historically documented species that once occupied the space is possible. However, for “cultural landscapes,” in Europe especially, where the original ecosystem was disturbed centuries ago, restoration ecology is less likely. This realization leaves room for other creative options for abandoned lands.","A relação entre água, energia e alimento é um tema que tem recebido atenção no meio acadêmico. Diante da escassez dos recursos naturais, da degradação que tem ocorrido não somente no Brasil, mas no mundo todo, os recursos naturais têm sérios riscos de esgotarem. E há que se pensar em uma gestão que possibilite a recuperação do meio ambiente de forma eficiente e sustentável. Compreendendo que o debate de nexo envolve um conjunto de inter-relações entre os recursos naturais utilizados como insumo para os serviços básicos da vida humana, neste sentido, a presente pesquisa objetivou analisar se há possibilidade de integrar a floresta ao nexo água-energia-alimentos, com vistas a não comprometer as demandas futuras e como isso pode contribuir para alcançar os Objetivos de Desenvolvimento Sustentável (ODS). Os objetivos específicos são identificar a interligação entre água, energia, alimento e floresta; apontar a necessidade de integrar a floresta ao nexo tradicional visando alcançar um desenvolvimento mais sustentável e controlar, prevenir as consequências dos impactos ambientais. A metodologia da revisão literária ocorreu com o levantamento por termos previamente identificados nas bases de dados Scopus, Web of Science e Periódico Capes, sendo a pesquisa classificada com abordagem qualitativa e método dedutivo. Os resultados apontaram que a floresta possui relação direta com os elementos água-energia-alimentos, sendo possível contribuir com as seguranças hídrica, energética e alimentar. Concluiu-se que vincular as florestas ao nexo existente, proporcionará uma maior preocupação para garantir a sustentabilidade e o equilíbrio ambiental.   Referências ALROY, John.

Relação entre a disponibilidade hídri","This article sets out to unravel aspects of environmental changes in the Upper Tana during the second millennium AD. This aspect has not been adequately addressed in the Upper Tana. This makes it clear that a lacuna exists in the study of communities of the Upper Tana and the way they interact with their environment in the past and present times. The objective of this article is to evaluate the relationship between human activities and environmental change in the Upper Tana from AD 1000 to 1950. It is hypothesized that the advent of iron technology and its attendant economic activities led to the depletion of indigenous forests and the general environmental degradation. The article has employed archaeological, ethnographic, oral and historical methodologies to gather data on vegetation change in the Upper Tana and other related regions.  The article, argues that livestock grazing, iron smelting, slush and burn agriculture, and the clearing of forests for housing are key contributors to vegetation change in the Upper Tana.  Results from oral reconstruction of the past vegetation of the area, and using the plant succession theory, shows that the lowland area of the Upper Tana is actually savanna with scattered trees probably inhabited by grazers. It is posited that the above factors, together with persistent droughts have altered the vegetation cover of the area.  What we have today is colonization of less desirable stunted growth. The theory advanced here is that the vegetation change has been a result of human activities.  Overwhelmingly, results the study that the researcher carried out, showed that the causes of these changes have been socio-economically associated with the expansion of agricultural communities into the area; rather than through climatic factors. Colonisation and other forces of modernistion have also contributed to the underlying problem. The article concludes that anthropogenetic factors have greatly contributed to environmental change in the upper Tana. Certainly, environmental change is a global phenomenon that has elicited research interests due to its negative impacts on human population. It is recommended that knowledge of environmental change in the past should be used to extrapolate modern environmental challenges affecting African ecosystems.","Currently, ~65% of extant primate species (ca 512 species) distributed in 91 countries in the Neotropics, mainland Africa, Madagascar, South Asia and Southeast Asia are threatened with extinction and 75% have declining populations as a result of deforestation and habitat loss resulting from increasing global market demands, and land conversion for industrial agriculture, cattle production and natural resource extraction. Other pressures that negatively impact primates are unsustainable bushmeat hunting, the illegal trade of primates as pets and as body parts, expanding road networks in previously isolated areas, zoonotic disease transmission and climate change. Here we examine current and future trends in several socio-economic factors directly or indirectly affecting primates to further our understanding of the interdependent relationship between human well-being, sustainable development, and primate population persistence. We found that between 2001 and 2018 ca 191 Mha of tropical forest (30% canopy cover) were lost as a result of human activities in the five primate range regions. Forty-six percent of this loss was in the Neotropics (Mexico, Central and South America), 30% in Southeast Asia, 21% in mainland Africa, 2% in Madagascar and 1% in South Asia. Countries with the greatest losses (ca 57% of total tree cover loss) were Brazil, Indonesia, DRC, China, and Malaysia. Together these countries harbor almost 50% of all extant primate species. In 2018, the world human population was estimated at ca 8bn people, ca 60% of which were found in primate range countries. Projections to 2050 and to 2100 indicate continued rapid growth of the human populations in these five primate range regions, with Africa surpassing all the other regions and totaling ca 4bn people by the year 2100. Socioeconomic indicators show that, compared to developed nations, most primate range countries are characterized by high levels of poverty and income inequality, low human development, low food security, high levels of corruption and weak governance. Models of Shared Socioeconomic Pathway scenarios (SSPs) projected to 2050 and 2100 showed that whereas practices of increasing inequality (SSP4) or unconstrained growth in economic output and energy use (SSP5) are projected to have dire consequences for human well-being and primate survivorship, practices of sustainability-focused growth and equality (SSP1) are expected to have a positive effect on maintaining biodiversity, protecting environments, and improving the human condition. These results stress that improving the well-being, health, and security of the current and future human populations in primate range countries are of paramount importance if we are to move forward with effective policies to protect the world’s primate species and promote biodiversity conservation.","Climate change will challenge the resilience of both agriculture-based livelihoods and natural resource management regimes in East Africa in myriad ways. A major challenge is to reduce the vulnerability of people and climate-sensitive sectors, including water, agriculture, and energy, to today?s climate variability and to ensure that future development activities are appropriate to future climate contexts. Through an Ecosystem-based Adaptation (EbA) research approach this project will help to inform rural stakeholders and national policy makers in East Africa regarding the sustainability of different local and national adaptation strategies. The research approaches will integrate a review of the climate change adaptation policy contexts with local level analyses of stakeholder vulnerability, and roles of forest and tree-based ecosystem services in promoting resilience of agriculture production. Based on these research outputs a participatory approach will be used to develop effective adaptation strategies targeted at different local and national stakeholder groups. This research project will target select communities on the Kenyan and Ugandan slopes of Mt. Elgon, known as one of the five water towers of Kenya. This project will be led by the Center for International Forestry Research (CIFOR). The research team conducting this project comprises two international centers of scientific excellence focussed specifically on forestry and agroforestry-science (CIFOR and the World Agroforestry Center), with one institution in Uganda (Makerere University) and one in Kenya (KEFRI) and that have led the development of long-term studies on forest based governance and livelihoods in their respective countries. Together, this group of institutions assembles leading scientists in their respective fields, providing this project with expertise in climate and ecosystem modelling, analysis of vulnerability and governance institutions, understandings of national and sub-national policy debates around climate change adaptation, and both the knowledge of research contexts and stakeholder rapport at sub-/national levels needed to ensure successful research and policy maker engagement. This project represents a continuation of the Rockefeller Foundation?s commitment to facilitating the development of East African excellence in research around climate change issues. This collaboration between CIFOR and the World Agroforestry Center is also consistent with the new realignment of Consultative Group for International Agricultural Research (CGIAR) research efforts, specifically through the development of the CGIAR Research Program 6 (CRP6) entitled: Forests, Trees and Agroforestry: Livelihoods, Landscapes and Governance.",13.4644979038457,1,"world, research, resourc"

Land is a principal factor of production, a source of life and livelihoods. It provides a means of living and a variety of uses such as agricultural, human settlement, environmental conservation, urban and industrial development purposes among others. These uses compete for space in a fixed area, hence the rising land use conflicts and degradation. The situation has threatened lives and livelihoods, making it difficult to plan for the livelihood activities in the County. This is happening against the backdrop of land use policy changes including; sessional paper no 3 of 2009 on the National Land Policy, the Constitution of Kenya 2010, the Land Act, 2012, the Land Registration Act, 2012, the Community Land Act, 2016 and sessional paper no 1 of 2017 on National Land Use Policy that were intended to alleviate the situation. This situation is now a major threat to the livelihood of the local communities in Baringo County. This study, therefore, sought to examined the dynamics of land use changes on the livelihood of the local communities in Baringo county with specific objective to establish the drivers of the changes. A comprehensive desk review of existing literature was done, and land use changes were descriptively analyzed. The review spanned from pre-colonial (before 1895), colonial (1895 to 1963), independence (1963 to 2010) including the subsequent years of land reforms following the promulgation of the Constitution of Kenya 2010 onwards to 2020. The study found that the key drivers of land use changes originate from the change of land use policies from customary to European-like systems during the colonial era (1895 to 1963). These drivers revolve around the conflicts in the application of land use policies and laws, dual production system (different land use for registered private land in arable areas and the unregistered community land in non-arable areas within the county) occasioning wide productivity gap and economic disparity. Further the knowledge gaps associated with colonial perceptions, ideologies, and attitudinal International Journal of Academic Research in Business and Social Sciences Vol. 1 1 , No. 9, 2021, E-ISSN: 2222-6990 © 2021 HRMARS 562 practices, which led to misconception and wrong policies aggravated the situation. The consequences disorganize the local community land use and social system, broke down the traditional grazing and cropping patterns, depleted soils fertility & degraded the environment. In addition, the study found out that in the unregistered community land, land use conflicts were rampant, and characterized by invaded and claim interest as well as unscrupulous legal manipulation of land ownership records leading to dispossession. These two salient features are the main drivers of land use changes that led to continuous and frequent fatal inter-ethnic land use conflicts among the local communities; causing displacement and destruction of property among other atrocities working against politically weak local community. This scenario destabilized livelihood possibilities making it difficult for local communities to engage in basic livelihood activities and create uncertainty for future development. The study concluded that the security of land tenure perpetrates land use conflicts particularly in the unregistered community land. The government, therefore, need to register the community land to enhance land tenure security in the county. Background of the Study The background of the study covers introduction, problem statement, objectives Introduction Globally, land resource is the basis of human livelihood, since it provides basic needs such as food, water, energy, clothing and shelter. It allows for a variety of uses including agricultural production, human settlement and environmental conservation to preserve it for posterity, and can satisfy a diverse range of local communities’ livelihood objectives. All these uses of land resource compete for space in a fixed land area within an ever-changing environment. In addition, it is a finite resource and increasingly becoming scarce over time. The ensuing competition and growing forces at work necessitates government intervention through land use policy in order to harmonize the various uses. Moreover, in practice, it is difficult to arrive to an equilibrium between the various uses without an external force. Therefore, the unfolding scenario leads to land use changes problems, which calls for government intervention through land use policies. Land use policy is intended to balance users demands, facilitate production and sustain livelihood for the local communities and at same time guarantee political stability. In this study, dynamics of land use changes is defined as policy changes and the resultant consequences. In Africa, dynamics of land use changes evolved through various transformations associated with government policies adopted by different political regimes. The changes were traced from the precolonial, colonial and post-colonial eras. Each of these eras introduced changes in land use policies that shape up different social, economic and political realities on the livelihood of the local communities. Livelihood is defined as comprising the capabilities, assets (including both material and social resources) and activities required for a means of living by the local communities (Scones, 2008). Livelihood is sustainable when it can cope with the policy changes, and recover from, stresses and shocks arising from it, maintain or enhance local communities’ capabilities, assets and activities, while not undermining the natural resources base. In this case, land resource represents the natural resource base, and the capacity of the local communities to use it to generate and maintain their means of living, enhance their well-being and preserve it for future generations is dependent on policy changes. These changes influence greatly the livelihood outcomes of the local communities. International Journal of Academic Research in Business and Social Sciences Vol. 1 1 , No. 9, 2021, E-ISSN: 2222-6990 © 2021 HRMARS 563 In this respect, local communities are indigenous populations who reside and derive their livelihood from land resource. They consider land resource as the principal factor of production and the source of livelihood because it provides basic needs such as food, water, energy, clothing and shelter. Land resource also allows for a variety of uses including agricultural, human settlement and environmental conservation that satisfy a diverse range of livelihood objectives for local communities. In Kenya, dynamics of land use changes emanates largely from colonial regime actions and policies, which continued in slightly modified manner after independence (Thuo, 2013). Before the colonial era (before 1895), land use was managed through African local communities’ customary laws. Land use and management practices were guided and controlled by established regulations and procedures among various local communities (Thuo, 2013). Land use was organized into specific areas of agricultural (crops and livestock), human settlement, environmental conservation uses and heritage sites, among others. Most of the land resource was owned by the entire community while individual community members had only user rights (Thuo, 2013). The land use was communal, small-scale subsistence in nature, stable and sustainable in terms of provision for local communities’ livelihood and environmental conservation needs. The period depicts a close economy without government intervention in terms of land use policy changes. Local communities enjoy territorial niches with boundaries defined by specific geographical and physical features such as rivers, mountains, trees, and valleys. The ethnic community chiefs, assisted by the Council of elders, had the power to make land use decisions. Land use was assumed to operate in a dynamic equilibrium checked by raids and natural disasters such as war, disease outbreaks, earthquakes and famines. Soil fertility was maintained through shift cultivation with adequate fallow periods of three (3) years or more required to restore soil structure and fertility. Much of the uncultivated land was used as pastoral communities grazing areas. Forested areas were used for hunting, trapping and honey gathering. Periodic droughts checked Land use and inter communities’ raids to maintain the dynamic equilibrium. During colonial era(1895 to 1963), the colonial government took over the control of land use from the local communities through violence, trickery, and mutual agreements (Thuo, 2013). It dismantled the ethnic community territorial niches and nationalized land use. All land in Kenya became Crown Land. All local communities were dispossessed, and customary land use laws by the local communities were rendered redundant. All existing land use rights by the local communities were at the mercy of the colonial power (Okoth-Ogendo, 1995). Therefore, the genesis of land use problems in Kenya. Fundamentally, the land use policy changes were biased and oriented to benefit European settlers with scant attention to local communities. The land use policies created a dual land use system where the European colonists occupy the high rainfall and fertile areas, employing modern land use practices based on individuals’ decisions. At the same time, the local communities were restricted to native reserves in the drier regions, where local communities were allowed to continue with collective land use decisions. These land use changes promoted economic disparity between European settler and local communities during colonial era. Land use policies promoted high productivity land use practices for European white farmers, while encouraging low productivity traditional land use practices for local communities. The land use policy c","This study was conducted on an assessment of the various mitigation strategies to combat desertification in Jibia and Kaita Local Government Areas of Katsina State, Nigeria. The data use includes Satellite imageries for the study such as landsat MSS of 1976, landsat TM of 1987, SPOT XS of 1995 and landsat ETM of 2006 as well as structured questionnaires. Sixty close ended copies of the Questionnaire were administered in the study. Purposive sampling method of administering questionnaires was adopted. The percentages land mass covered for each of these variables was determined and estimated in M2. literature was obtained from various agencies which were responsible for desertification control in Katsina state. It was found from the reserved forest that in 1976 the percentage of reserved forest was 2.57%. In 1987 however, it increased by 73.9% to 76.47 %. By 1995, it declined by 9.42% to 67.05% and further declined by 0.52% in 2006. Effort to combat desertification through the use of reserved forest has been quite significant over the years. Also, noticed was a declined in shelter belt from 5.91% in 1987 to 1.097% in 1995 and a shot up to 7.39% in 2006. About 37% of the respondent opined that the deforestation leads to the disappearance of trees while 33% pinioned that it leads to reduction on agricultural productivity. The major strategy adopted to combat desertification is tree planting as supported by 88% of the respondents. It found that desertification as major environmental problem of the study area has reduced drastically from 43.34% in 1976 to 1.29% in 2006. It was also revealed from this study that some organizations such as European Economic Community/Katsina State government EEC/KTSG, Katsina Afforestation Project Unit KTAPU and Local Government Councils are the major agencies that are responsible for mitigating desertification in the study area.

The historical indigenous land use of the Mara and wider Mau basin was wildlife conservation and pastoralism with highland agriculture. However, land policy changes, the rise of community conservancies and the increase in human populations have mediated unprecedented land use shifts over time. We analyze land use and land cover change (LULCC) trends from 1990 to 2040 in the Mara and the wider Mau River Basin landscape. The study examines land use and land cover change trends, establishes factors driving the trends, and assesses the implications of these trends on biodiversity. Multi-temporal satellite images, together with physical and social economic data, were collated to generate future scenarios for transitions for forest, shrubland, grassland, cropland, wetlands and built-up areas between 1990 and 2040. Agricultural expansion is the chief driver of LULCC in the Mara and the wider Mau River Basin, particularly since 2015. There was insignificant change to the forest cover after 2015, which was in part due to government intervention on forest encroachment and boundaries. The anthropogenic choice of tilling the land in the basin caused a decline in grasslands, forests and expanded shrublands, particularly where there was clear tree cutting in the Mau forest. Land use and land cover trends have generated undesirable impacts on ecosystem services that support wildlife conservation.","Agroforestry is one of the most conspicuous land use systems across landscapes and agro ecological zones in Africa. Some of the components of Agroforestry systems are; home garden agroforestry, alley cropping, forest farming, wind break, river banks, park land, crop land trees and buffer zones agroforestry practices. Climate change impacts by complex weather-related phenomena have threatened agricultural and forest ecosystems and the livelihood of agricultural and local communities. Agroforestry has an important role in climate change adaptation through diversified land-use practices, sustainable livelihoods, sources of income, enhanced forest and agricultural productivity and reduced weather-related production losses, which enhance resilience against climate impacts. Like few other land use options, agroforestry has real potential to contribute to food security, climate change mitigation and adaptation, while preserving and strengthening the environmental resource base of Africa’s rural landscapes. It has a key role to play in landscape-scale mitigation schemes under the REDD+or AFOLU (Agriculture, Forestry and other land uses) concepts. Home garden agroforestry system indicates that adaptation and mitigation to climate change will largely depend on the increased resilience of both agroforestry systems and of local management capacity. Despite less attention has been given to tree based land use option, agroforestry has played a major role in reducing household vulnerability to shocking. Smallholder farmers have already started mainstreaming tree based land use system as resilience to social needs because the poor are more exposed to change; Agroforestry is one of best risk aversion option to make them move out of food insecurity. Generally, agroforestry systems readily bundle both mitigation and adaptation strategies and provide several pathways to securing food security for poor farmers, while contributing to climate change mitigation. Agroforestry should attract more attention in global agendas on climate adaptation and mitigation because of its positive social and environmental impacts.","ABSTRACT Land systems are described based on various characteristics, including land cover composition and agricultural production. However, it is uncertain to what extent livestock, particularly monogastric livestock, determines land systems. We included monogastrics in a land system classification, and statistically analyzed the land cover composition and agricultural production of otherwise similar land systems with and without monogastric livestock. The results indicate that land systems with monogastrics are statistically different from their counterparts in the classification without monogastrics in terms of grassland area and crop yields, but are less different in terms of tree area, crop area, and ruminant livestock production. We then used a land systems map that includes monogastrics in the classification and a similar map that does not include monogastrics to project future changes in a novel manner that integrates livestock as a determinant of land systems. The results show that including monogastrics in otherwise similar projections yields less cropland intensification and more cropland expansion in several world regions, including Northern Africa and the Middle East. Other regions, such as Europe and Australia, were characterized by less decrease or more increase in tree area in the application with monogastrics, mainly due to the occurrence of open forests with monogastrics. This study prompts a call for improved characterization of land systems for land use and cover change (LUCC) assessments in order to better represent LUCC driven by monogastric livestock.","In Sub-Saharan Africa, conventional farming is associated with intensive use of synthetic chemicals and inputs to maximize agricultural productivity. This is done at the expense of sustainable agroecologically based production systems. This objective was to describe limitations of agroecological practices and stakeholders’ response along Mountain Uluguru. The area has been vulnerable to unregulated land degradation aggravated by soil erosion largely due to unsuitable agricultural practices. The data were collected through questionnaires and in-depth interviews from 72 respondents who were purposively selected. Both qualitative and quantitative data were analysed using content analysis and statistical software respectively. Farmers undertake agriculture to increase production so as to meet food needs (44.8%) and employment opportunities (55.2%). About 41.7% of farmers who had land with secure tenure grew fruit and non-fruit trees on their farms or homesteads, 11.7% rented the farming land temporarily from owners through informal arrangements and the rest squatted on public land for cultivation of vegetables. From SWOT analysis, agroforestry is threatened by unregulated agricultural activities (18.6%) and overuse of forest resources unsustainably (7.0%). The agroecology training is not coordinated and supported by government agencies, which have authority to inform the policy makers about insecure land tenure and unavailability of organic inputs that would increase farmers’ livelihoods. Agro-soil erosion control and conservation agriculture measures are essential features of agroecology training, but some farmers were not aware of them and those who are aware do not adopt them effectively. The study concludes that, without the government acknowledgement of agro-ecology and its associated contributions there will always be weak institutional coordination among stakeholders required to regulate, promote and support agro-ecology practices to create a balance of conserved environment, protected ecology and enhanced farmers’ livelihoods. This is because there is no clear national guidelines and support (financial and technical) addressing the challenges facing agro-ecology practice","This study is focused on land use and land cover dynamics observed in Central River Region. It aims to determine the direction and rate of change in land use as a means of assessing the impact of climate change in Central River Region (CRR) of The Gambia. Decadal satellite images were used to measure changes in land use and land cover from 1984 to 2017 using supervised classification. Eight land use and land cover types were identified and mapped in this study namely: Crop lands, Gambia River, Halophytic vegetation, Irrigated crops, Mangrove, Settlement, Shrub/Wood savanna and Wooded savanna. The areas of crop lands, halophytic vegetation and settlement expanded between 1984 and 2017. River Gambia, irrigated crops, mangrove, shrub/wood savanna and wooded savanna areas decreased during the same period. Transition to less savanna was higher than transition to more settlement. In addition, physicochemical parameters were analyzed during the rainy and dry seasons for correlation with climate data. Socioeconomic surveys based on structured questionnaires were also conducted with 70 households in 6 villages in CRR. Land clearing for agriculture, tree cutting for firewood and charcoal, settlement and livestock grazing were mainly cited by the respondents as the main culprit inducing land cover change in CRR. This study shows that deforestation and forest degradation are still in progress despite the implementation of a management plan for a full rotation. We therefore proposed best management practices in order to control the agricultural clearing of land in the region such as agricultural intensification and soil fertility improvement.","I examined variation in community structure, species richness, biomass and abundance of Coprini dung beetles from 45 trapping sites in meadows, 35-year-old secondary forests and primary forests in tropical, high-elevation karst ecosystems of Puluong Nature Reserve, Thanh Hoa Province. My main aim was to explore community response to the influence of land use change. By comparing the structure and community attributes of the beetles between 35-year-old secondary forests and primary forests, I expected to give indications on the conservation value of the old secondary forests for beetle conservation. Community structure significantly differed among land-use types. Species richness, abundance and biomass were significantly higher in forest habitats than in meadows. The cover of ground vegetation, soil clay content and tree diameter are important factors structuring Coprini communities in karst ecosystems of Pu Luong. The secondary forests, after 35 years of regrowth showed similarities in species richness, abundance and biomass to primary forests. This gives hope for the recovery of Coprini communities during forest succession. Keywords: Coprini, dung beetles, karst ecosystems, land use change, Pu Luong. References: [1] I. Hanski, Y.

Yet, its ecosystems are threatened by increasing number of elephants and illegal human activities. Renowned as a model of wildlife participatory management, NGR has mainly been studied for its animal wildlife only. The aim of this study was to uncover ecological effects of recent land management on savanna habitats including tourism, and to conclude on more sustainable options, land use/land cover (LULC) changes and vegetation dynamics in NGR were analyzed. This was accomplished with multi-temporal change detection using Landsat images of 1984, 2002 and 2013 to map seven representative LULC classification categories, and quantitative indices of landscape metrics. The results showed that the LULC dynamics in NGR from 1984 to 2013 was mainly characterized by an expansion of gallery forest, tree savanna and agricultural area and a reduction of shrub savanna, woodland and bare soils. From 2002 to 2013, fragmentation in all land cover types increased at the landscape level, whereas at the class level, it decreased for woodland. Our findings provided evidence of habitat degradation in NGR, due to extensive agriculture, tourism and growing of elephants’ population. According to the original management goals and the purposes of the reserve, both fauna and tourism are to be maintained and sustained in a sustainable way. Adaptation of land use and targeted wildlife management are the main requirements for avoiding further degradation of vegetation and thus of the existence basis of local inhabitants, animals and tourism.","Niassa National Reserve (NNR) supports Mozambique's largest populations of endangered fauna and sustains the livelihoods of > 40,000 people who utilise its natural resources. Accurately monitoring finescale spatial and temporal trends in land-use and tree-cover is increasingly used for monitoring the ecological state of conservation areas. Here we provide essential information on land-use changes in NNR to support ongoing conservation efforts in the region. We examined patterns of forest and woodland loss in NNR between 2001 and 2014 using high resolution maps of global tree-cover change, and compared this with changes in the wider region. We found that NNR lost 108 km of forest (0.9 per cent of its 11,970 km aggregated forest extent), with the majority (89 km) of forest loss occurring due to expanding agriculture around settlements and along main roads. Although this loss was substantial, it was lower than changes in the surrounding region, with the adjacent districts and Provinces losing 200 km (3.2 per cent) and 6,594 km (5.7 per cent) of their respective forest extents. We found NNR's diverse Miombo ecosystems are still intact and could support large mega-faunal assemblages, investment in ensuring the long-term success of NNR is an obvious global conservation priority.",14.0224448002769,3,"product, polici, practic"
