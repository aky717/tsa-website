To answer this question in the Demo- cratic Republic of Congo, the Makala project mapped the tree and forest resources of Kinshasa’s wood-fuel supply basin and at- tempted to predict how they would evolve in the future. Maps were made for four periods (1984, 2001, 2006 and 2012) using a mosaic of four LANDSAT images. The above-ground biomass was estimated in 2012 using forest inventories in 317 plots distributed across the four types of plant cover found on the Bateke plateau (4,337 trees and 44 species were recorded). This inventory data com- bined with the satellite data allowed us to make the first comprehensive assessment of above-ground biomass in the study area. Be- tween 2000 and 2012, the average volume of wood-fuel fell by more than 50%. Over the entire period studied (1984 to 2012), carbon stocks fell by 75%. In the wood-fuel supply area for Kinshasa, the drastic loss of forest cover, shortened fallow periods, savannah encroachment and the decline of biomass and carbon stocks are clear signals of deg- radation. However, these initial estimations were derived from a small sample that was extrapolated to the entire supply area. It would be very useful to increase sampling in order to obtain more accurate and realistic figures. The experience of the Makala pro- ject clearly shows that the analysis of land cover change helps to understand and docu- ment the spatial organization and mecha- nisms of forest degradation. However, only with a sound wood-fuel resource policy and sustainable community land management, combined with very dynamic tree reintroduc- tion on agricultural land, will it be possible to initiate a sustainable process of restoration.","Due to rising global warming and climate change, biodiversity protection has become a critical ecological concern. Rich biodiversity zones are under threat and are deteriorating, necessitating national, regional, and provincial efforts to safeguard these natural areas. The effective conservation of national parks and nature-protected areas help to improve biodiversity conservation, forest, and urban air quality. The continuous encroachment and abuse of these protected areas have degraded the ecosystem over time. While exploring the geophysical ecology and biodiversity conservation of these areas in West Africa, Kainji National Park was selected for this study because of its notable location, naturalness, rich habitat diversity, topographic uniqueness, and landmass. The conservation of national parks and nature-protected areas is a cornerstone of biodiversity conservation globally. This study is aimed at the target United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goal 13, 2030—Climate Action targeted at taking urgent action towards combating climate change and its impacts. The study captures both flora and fauna that are dominant in the study area. The 15 identified tree species were selected from over 30 species with 563,500,000 (an average of 3,700,000 in each sample frame) trees for every tree species/type with a total of 63% tree green canopy cover. The study areas divided into three zones were randomly sampled within a stratum of 25 × 25 km frames divided into 150 sample frames for proper analyses using the i-Tree Eco v6.0.25. It is a United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Forest Service peer-reviewed application (software) designed which includes tools for urban and rural forestry study and benefits evaluations. The following microclimatic data were captured and analyzed photosynthetically active radiation, rain/precipitation, temperature, transpiration, evaporation, water intercepted by trees, runoff avoided by trees, potential evaporation by trees, and isoprene and monoterpene by trees. This study also further discusses the tree benefits of a green, low carbon, and sustainable environment within the context of biodiversity conservation, considering carbon storage, carbon sequestration, hydrology effects, pollution removal, oxygen production, and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). There is a quick need for remotely-sensed information about the national parks, protected areas and nature reserves at regular intervals, and government policies must be strict against illegal poaching, logging activities, and other hazardous human impacts.","To contribute to the development of methods for the sustainable management of forest ecosystems in Central Africa, the following research question was addressed: can analyses of land cover change help to understand and document the spatial organization and mechanisms of forest degradation?

(Resume d'auteur)","Landscapes surrounding protected areas, while still containing considerable biodiversity, have rapidly growing human populations and associated agricultural development in most of the developing world that tend to isolate them, potentially reducing their conservation value. Using field studies and multi-temporal Landsat imagery, we examine a forest park, Kibale National Park in western Uganda, its changes over time, and related land cover change in the surrounding landscape. We find Kibale has successfully defended its borders and prevents within-park deforestation and other land incursions, and has maintained tree cover throughout the time period of the study. Outside the park there was a significant increase in tea plantations and continued forest fragmentation and wetland loss. The question of whether the park is a conservation success because of the network of forest fragments and wetlands or in spite of them remains unanswered.","A relação entre água, energia e alimento é um tema que tem recebido atenção no meio acadêmico. Diante da escassez dos recursos naturais, da degradação que tem ocorrido não somente no Brasil, mas no mundo todo, os recursos naturais têm sérios riscos de esgotarem. E há que se pensar em uma gestão que possibilite a recuperação do meio ambiente de forma eficiente e sustentável. Compreendendo que o debate de nexo envolve um conjunto de inter-relações entre os recursos naturais utilizados como insumo para os serviços básicos da vida humana, neste sentido, a presente pesquisa objetivou analisar se há possibilidade de integrar a floresta ao nexo água-energia-alimentos, com vistas a não comprometer as demandas futuras e como isso pode contribuir para alcançar os Objetivos de Desenvolvimento Sustentável (ODS). Os objetivos específicos são identificar a interligação entre água, energia, alimento e floresta; apontar a necessidade de integrar a floresta ao nexo tradicional visando alcançar um desenvolvimento mais sustentável e controlar, prevenir as consequências dos impactos ambientais. A metodologia da revisão literária ocorreu com o levantamento por termos previamente identificados nas bases de dados Scopus, Web of Science e Periódico Capes, sendo a pesquisa classificada com abordagem qualitativa e método dedutivo. Os resultados apontaram que a floresta possui relação direta com os elementos água-energia-alimentos, sendo possível contribuir com as seguranças hídrica, energética e alimentar. Concluiu-se que vincular as florestas ao nexo existente, proporcionará uma maior preocupação para garantir a sustentabilidade e o equilíbrio ambiental.   Referências ALROY, John.

Relação entre a disponibilidade hídri","Forests and woodlands remain under threat in tropical Africa due to excessive exploitation and inadequate management interventions, and the isolated success stories of tree retention and tree cover transition on African agricultural land are less well documented. In this study, we characterize the status of tree cover in a landscape that contains forest patches, fallows, and farms in the southern part of Uluguru Mountains. We aimed to unveil the practices of traditional tree fallow system which is socially acceptable in local settings and how it provides a buffering effects to minimize forest disturbances and thus represents an important step towards tree cover transition. We assessed land cover dynamics for the period of 1995 to 2020 and compared tree stocking for forest patches, fallows, and farms. We found that tree biomass carbon stocks were 56 ± 5 t/ha in forest patches, 33 ± 7 t/ha in fallows, and 9 ± 2 t/ha on farms. In terms of land cover, farms shrank at intensifying rates over time for the entire assessment period of 1995–2020. Forest cover decreased from 1995–2014, with the reduction rate slowing from 2007–2014 and the trend reversing from 2014–2020, such that forest cover showed a net increase across the entire study period. Fallow consistently and progressively increased from 1995–2020. We conclude that traditional tree fallows in the study site remain a significant element of land management practice among communities, and there appears to be a trend towards intensified tree-based farming. The gains in fallowed land represent an embracing of a traditional land management system that supports rotational and alternate uses of cropping space as well as providing a buffering effect to limit over-exploitation of forests. In order to maximize tree cover and carbon stocks in the farm landscape, this well-known traditional tree fallow system can be further optimized through the incorporation of additional innovations.","This study was conducted on an assessment of the various mitigation strategies to combat desertification in Jibia and Kaita Local Government Areas of Katsina State, Nigeria. The data use includes Satellite imageries for the study such as landsat MSS of 1976, landsat TM of 1987, SPOT XS of 1995 and landsat ETM of 2006 as well as structured questionnaires. Sixty close ended copies of the Questionnaire were administered in the study. Purposive sampling method of administering questionnaires was adopted. The percentages land mass covered for each of these variables was determined and estimated in M2. literature was obtained from various agencies which were responsible for desertification control in Katsina state. It was found from the reserved forest that in 1976 the percentage of reserved forest was 2.57%. In 1987 however, it increased by 73.9% to 76.47 %. By 1995, it declined by 9.42% to 67.05% and further declined by 0.52% in 2006. Effort to combat desertification through the use of reserved forest has been quite significant over the years. Also, noticed was a declined in shelter belt from 5.91% in 1987 to 1.097% in 1995 and a shot up to 7.39% in 2006. About 37% of the respondent opined that the deforestation leads to the disappearance of trees while 33% pinioned that it leads to reduction on agricultural productivity. The major strategy adopted to combat desertification is tree planting as supported by 88% of the respondents. It found that desertification as major environmental problem of the study area has reduced drastically from 43.34% in 1976 to 1.29% in 2006. It was also revealed from this study that some organizations such as European Economic Community/Katsina State government EEC/KTSG, Katsina Afforestation Project Unit KTAPU and Local Government Councils are the major agencies that are responsible for mitigating desertification in the study area.

Areas in the proximity of metropoles undergo land use changes but are poorly studied for their soil and biomass carbon budget, especially in Africa. Close to Benin's economic capital, the Lama Territory located on the Allada Plateau and is subject to high demographic and urbanization pressures. Carbon (C) stocks in the region are likely to be rapidly changing. This research assessed the land use changes and quantified the spatial distribution and variation of C stocks between 2000 and 2018 on the Ferralsols of the study area. Random forest models using spectral bands of LANDSAT images and some spectral indices as predictors were calibrated to classify the land use. C stocks of four C pools (aboveground, belowground biomass, litter, and soil) were mapped with InVEST (integrated valuation of ecosystem services and tradeoffs) model. Land use change occurred in 61% of the Ferralsol area between 2000 and 2018. The surface of forests and crop‐plantation associations decreased in benefit of tree plantations, adult palm groves, and built‐up areas. With the loss of forest surface and the increasing urbanization, C stocks of the region decreased by −218 Gg C with 4% uncertainty (−175 Gg C in soil pools, and − 125 Gg C in aboveground biomass with both 6% uncertainty) between 2000 and 2018. Results highlight: (i) the need for soil C stock accounting to avoid underestimation of C stocks evolution in a rural region; and (ii) the relevance of tree plantations and deforestation control to maintain the C stocks in tropical areas.","Reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation, and enhancing carbon stocks (REDD+) is a crucial component of global climate change mitigation. Remote sensing can provide continuous and spatially explicit above-ground biomass (AGB) estimates, which can be valuable for the quantification of carbon stocks and emission factors (EFs). Unfortunately, there is little information on the fate of the land following tropical deforestation and of the associated carbon stock. This study quantified post-deforestation land use across the tropics for the period 1990–2000. This dataset was then combined with a pan-tropical AGB map at 30 m resolution to refine EFs from forest conversion by matching deforestation areas with their carbon stock before and after clearing and to assess spatial dynamics of EFs by follow-up land use. In Latin America, pasture was the most common follow-up land use (72%), with large-scale cropland (11%) a distant second. In Africa deforestation was often followed by small-scale cropping (61%) with a smaller role for pasture (15%). In Asia, small-scale cropland was the dominant agricultural follow-up land use (35%), closely followed by tree crops (28%). Deforestation often occurred in forests with lower than average carbon stocks. EFs showed high spatial variation within eco-zones and countries. While our EFs are only representative for the studied time period, our results show that EFs are mainly determined by the initial forest carbon stock. The estimates of the fraction of carbon lost were less dependent on initial forest biomass, which offers opportunities for REDD+ countries to use these fractions in combination with recent good quality national forest biomass maps or inventory data to quantify emissions from specific forest conversions. Our study highlights that the co-location of data on forest loss, biomass and fate of the land provides more insight into the spatial dynamics of land-use change and can help in attributing carbon emissions to human activities.","Review: Old Fields: Dynamics and Restoration of Abandoned Farmland Viki A. Cramer and Richard J. Hobbs (Eds.) Reviewed by Joan Ellen Broome Georgia Southern University, USA Cramer, Viki A. and Richard J. Hobbs (Eds.). Old Fields: Dynamics and Restoration of Abandoned Farmland. Washington, D.C.: Island Press, 2007. 334 pp. ISBN 1597260754. US$40.00, paper. Recycled, acid free paper. The editors of Old Fields compiled what is the first international synthesis of research on the dynamics of land abandonment, whether it is former cropland, pasturage, or tree plantations. This alone makes it a laudable achievement. Both editors, Viki A. Cramer and Richard J. Hobbs, are affiliated with Murdoch University in Western Australia. Cramer is an ecologist in the School of Environmental Science where she teaches environmental restoration while Richard J. Hobbs is a fellow both there and at the Australian Academy of Science and serves as editor-in-chief of the journal Restoration Ecology. Together, in the first two chapters, they offer an overview of the body of work to date and outline the theoretical principles based on them. The case studies follow. Questions raised deal with the worldwide process of land abandonment and whether or not predictable patterns arise regardless of location. The post abandonment questions reckon with whether or not the dynamics of plant succession that follow once cultivated landscapes are peculiar to the locale or exhibit recognizable patterns globally. Why must these processes be investigated? Because understanding abandonment and post abandonment dynamics powerfully influence restoration ecology decisions. It is a useful work for scientists, practitioners and students of ecology. The interested generalist should await further synthesizing and a less technical approach. Cramer and Hobbs remind us that land abandonment is nothing new in human history. But the most recent version of it since records have been kept is instructive. The eastern U.S. became “the first region [on the planet] to experience significant abandonment of cropland from 1870 onward” (p. 3-5). The modern day experience in land abandonment has several causes. Among them are shifts in the demand for commodities in the world market that make a once intensely cultivated crop unprofitable; population explosions requiring human habitat development of former agricultural properties; intermittent environmental cataclysms like long term droughts; and long term abuses in production practices that led to catastrophes like deforestation. The research conducted covers a wide range of topographies. Case studies included are from Puerto Rico, Brazilian Amazonia, Australian Rain Forests, arid landscapes in Southeastern Spain and central Greece, shrub land in South Africa, and Michigan flatlands and the Piedmont area of New Jersey in the United States. One lapse in the book is the failure to mention one of the largest and dramatic restoration proposals in the U.S., which is also known as the “home of old fields ecology.” In the late 1980s, a super-sized restoration plan for the Great Plains poetically labeled “The Buffalo Commons” by the staid academicians who conceived it captured national headlines. The pair of scientists who devised this plan werefrom Rutgers University: Frank (international land use expert) and Deborah (geographer) Popper. The Poppers addressed their restoration plan at a conference of the Society for Ecological Restoration International in Chicago in June of 1990, where the couple and the concept (now accepted by initially hostile plains residents) received a warm welcome. The editors’ end chapter offers much to ponder as restoration ecology moves into new terrain, literally. Cramer and Hobbs observe that there are actually instances where restoration is not advisable. They rightly conclude that the models developed thus far were in “temperate areas of the Northern Hemisphere” and may not apply in the other regions featured in some of these case studies. In areas where intense cultivation followed by abandonment are recent, restoration based on historically documented species that once occupied the space is possible. However, for “cultural landscapes,” in Europe especially, where the original ecosystem was disturbed centuries ago, restoration ecology is less likely. This realization leaves room for other creative options for abandoned lands.",16.9507171834195,2,Unlabeled

We formally characterise and name this species as Deinbollia onanae (Sapindaceae-Litchi clade) and we discuss it in the context of the assemblage of montane tree species in the Cameroon Highlands of West-Central Africa. The new species is a shade-bearing, non-pioneer understorey forest tree species reaching 15 m high and a trunk diameter that can attain over 40 cm at 1.3 m above the ground. Seed dispersal has been recorded by chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes ellioti) and by putty-nose monkeys (Cercopithecus nictitans) and the species is used by chimpanzees for nesting. Cameroon has the highest species-diversity and species endemism known in this African-Western Indian Ocean genus of 42, mainly lowland species. Deinbollia onanae is an infrequent tree species known from six locations in surviving islands of montane (sometimes also upper submontane) forest along the line of the Cameroon Highlands, including one at Ngel Nyaki in Mambilla, Nigeria. Deinbollia onanae is here assessed as Endangered according to the IUCN 2012 standard, threatened by severe fragmentation of its mountain forest habitat due to extensive and ongoing clearance for agriculture. The majority of the 28 tree species of montane forest (above 2000 m alt.) in the Cameroon Highlands are also widespread in East African mountains (i.e. are Afromontane wide). Deinbollia onanae is one of only seven species known to be endemic (globally restricted to) these highlands. It is postulated that this new species is morphologically closest to Deinbollia oreophila, a frequent species at a lower (submontane) altitudinal band of the same range. Detailed ecological data on Deinbollia onanae from the Nigerian location, Ngel Nyaki, where it has been known under the name Deinbollia “pinnata”, is reviewed.","We revise and update the records of strict and near-endemic species of the Bali Ngemba Forest Reserve, the largest known surviving patch (c. 8 km2 in area) of submontane or cloud forest in the Bamenda Highlands, Cameroon which have lost >96 % of their original forest due to human activities. Nine strict endemics, and 11 near endemics are now documented, a drop from the number recorded after the first survey in 2004, since when five of the provisionally named species have been formally published. We test the hypothesis that a further one of the provisionally named putative Bali Ngemba new species, Vepris sp. A, an 8 – 20 m tall tree from cloud forest in the 1310 – 1600 m altitudinal band, is indeed new to science. We compare it morphologically with other multicarpellate, apocarpous, trifoliolate Cameroon tree species formerly placed in the genus Oricia Pierre until they were subsumed into Vepris by Mziray (1992). These are Vepris trifoliolata (Engl.) Mziray and V. gabonensis (Pierre) Mziray. We conclude that Vepris sp. A is a new undescribed species here named as Vepris onanae. The new species is illustrated, mapped and its conservation status assessed as Endangered using the 2012 IUCN standard due to the threats of habitat clearance from agricultural pressures at its three locations all of which remain formally unprotected. Vepris onanae appears unique among the Guineo-Congolian African oricioid species of Vepris in occurring in cloud forest, the other species, apart from V. renierii of the Albertine Rift, occurring in lowland forest. It also differs in the very broad, (7.8 –) 11.3 – 18 cm wide leaflets of the flowering stems which have a 6-18(−30) mm long, narrowly triangular acumen (vs leaflets <12 cm wide, acumen absent or short) and in having both subsessile and pedicellate (pedicels 0.25 – 0.3 mm long and 1(– 2) mm long) male flowers (vs male flower pedicels all sessile, or all c. 3 mm long). We report for the first time on stage-dependent leaf heteromorphy in Vepris and characterise a level of sexual dimorphism more advanced than usual in the genus. We highlight the importance of protecting Bali Ngemba and other forest patches in the Bamenda Highlands if species such as Vepris onanae are not soon to become extinct.","Deinbollia onanae (Sapindaceae-Litchi clade) is here formally named and characterised as a new species to science, previously known as Deinbollia sp. 2. Cameroon has the highest species-diversity and species endemism known in this African-Western Indian Ocean genus of 42 species. Deinbollia onanae is an infrequent tree species known from five locations in surviving islands of montane (or upper submontane) forest along the line of the Cameroon Highlands. It is here assessed as Endangered according to the IUCN 2012 standard, threatened mainly by clearance of forest for agriculture. The majority of tree species characteristic of montane forest (above 2000 m alt.) in the Cameroon Highlands are also widespread in East African mountains (i.e. are Afromontane). Deinbollia onanae is one of only a very small number of species that are endemic (globally restricted to) the mountain range. It is postulated that this new species is in a sister relationship with Deinbollia oreophila, which is a frequent species of a lower (submontane) altitudinal band of the same range. It is further postulated that seed dispersal is or was by frugivorous birds, potentially turacos, alternatively by primates such as Preuss s monkey.","In South Africa, much of the forest biome is vulnerable to human-induced disturbance. The forest-dwelling butterfly Charaxes xiphares occidentalis is naturally confined to a small forest region in the south-western Cape, South Africa. Most of the remaining habitat of this species is within a fragmented agricultural matrix. Furthermore, this geographical area is also heavily invaded by alien plants, especially Acacia mearnsii . We investigated how C. x. occidentalis behaviourally responds to different habitat conditions in the landscape. We were particularly interested in touring, patrolling and settling behaviour as a conservation proxy for preference of a certain habitat configuration in this agricultural matrix. Remnant forest patches in the agricultural matrix showed fewer behavioural incidents than in a reference protected area. Moreover, dense stands of A. mearnsii negatively influenced the incidence and settling pattern of this butterfly across the landscape, with fewer tree settlings associated with more heavily invaded forest patches. This settling pattern was predominantly seen in female butterflies. We also identified specific trees that were settled upon for longer periods by C. x. occidentalis . Distance to a neighbouring patch and patch size influenced behavioural incidences, suggesting that further patch degradation and isolation could be detrimental to this butterfly. Conservation implications: We highlight the importance of clearing invasive tree species from vulnerable forest ecosystems and identify key tree species to consider in habitat conservation and rehabilitation programmes for this butterfly. We also suggest retaining as much intact natural forest as possible. This information should be integrated in local biodiversity management plans.","Monanthotaxis bali is the only known, solely montane (occurring solely above 2000 m alt.) species of the genus. It joins Monanthotaxis orophila (Rwanda) and M. discolor (Tanzania), two other species that can also occur above 2000 m alt. Monanthotaxis bali is an addition to the small number (28) of the tree species of the surviving montane forests of the Cameroon Highlands of which only eight other species are endemic. Due to its supra-axillary inflorescences, and petals arranged in one whorl but with the outer petals overlapping the inner petals distally, and rounded flower buds, the new species is placed in Hoekstra’s clade B of Monanthotaxis. The new species is unusual in being a treelet in a predominantly lianescent genus, and in lacking the glaucous underside of the leaf-blades that usually characterises the genus. Monanthotaxis bali takes the number of continental African species of the genus to 80, and makes Cameroon, with 30 species, the most species-diverse country for the genus. Monanthotaxis bali is known only from the Bali Ngemba Forest Reserve, a forest remnant under pressure of degradation and clearance in the Bamenda Highlands of Cameroon. It may already be extinct due to logging and agricultural activities. Here it is described, illustrated, mapped and assessed as Critically Endangered (Possibly Extinct) using the IUCN 2012 criteria.","Abstract: Vepris bali is the first known species of Vepris in WC Africa with opposite, trifoliolate leaves and is further unusual for its long petiolules. Known only from Bali Ngemba Forest Reserve, a remnant of submontane forest under great pressure of degradation in the Bamenda Highlands of Cameroon, it may already be extinct due to tree cutting and agricultural incursions. Here, V. bali is compared with other endemic cloud forest Vepris of the Cameroon Highlands and is described, illustrated, mapped and assessed as Critically Endangered (Possibly Extinct) using IUCN 2012 criteria.

Prostephanus truncatus flight activity was consistently higher and the flight activity pattern significantly different near maize stores than at sites inside the forest. Although P. truncatus is known to infest girdled branches of Lannea nigritana (Sc. Elliot) Keay, the P. truncatus flight activity was comparatively low at forest sites where this tree species dominated. The main peak in P. truncatus flight activity occurred earlier in the eastern part of the forest compared with other forest parts. Ordination analysis showed that comparatively higher flight activity in the eastern part of the forest was positively associated with the presence of teak plantations (Tectona grandis L. F.) at trap sites. The spatial distribution of weekly P. truncatus trap catches were found to be significantly aggregated during a 21-wk period, which largely coincided with the early increase in P. truncatus flight activity in the eastern part of the forest. Based on this evidence, it was suggested that P. truncatus individuals disperse from the eastern part of the forest to other forest parts and to nearby agricultural areas, rather than, as has been previously suggested, from maize stores to the forest environment.","Background and aims - The Coastal Forests of Eastern Africa, stretching along the Indian Ocean coastline from Somalia to Mozambique, are considered by Conservation International to be a global biodiversity hotspot - an area of high diversity and endemism under increasing threat. Although the largest remaining extent of these forests is reported to be found in Mozambique, very little is known on their extent, condition and composition here. In addition, the term 'coastal forest' has been used in different ways by different authors. This paper defines and characterises coastal dry forests found in northern Mozambique and assesses their present extent, botanical composition, conservation importance and the threats to these forests. Methods - The study area of 18,150 km2 lies in Cabo Delgado Province in north-east Mozambique, adjacent to Tanzania. Its limits are determined primarily by geological substrate and landform. Four smaller study sites were chosen covering a range of landforms. Manual interpretation of satellite imagery dating from 1999-2002 was used to calculate possible previous and present extent of 'dense vegetation'. Extensive field collecting was used in determining botanical composition and distribution patterns. IUCN Red List assessments were carried out on selected species using distributional criteria. Results - Dry forests similar to those in southern Tanzania are found widely scattered across coastal Cabo Delgado, sitting in a matrix of miombo woodland and other vegetation types. However, forest cover is not as extensive was believed. We calculate that the original extent of 'dense vegetation cover', which includes coastal dry forest, was 6087 km2. Owing to clearance over the last 150 years this is now only 1182 km2, of which perhaps only 400 km2 is moderately-intact dry forest. In this southern part of their range such forests are essentially dry, not moist and mesic, and dominated by a high proportion of deciduous or sclerophyllous evergreen trees. The plant species composition differs significantly from that of the surrounding woodlands. There is a marked change in species composition between forest patches along the coast, and they contain numerous species with restricted global distribution. Since 2003, 68 species new to Mozambique have been recorded from Cabo Delgado in addition to 36 possible new species. Many new records are of species previously only known from south-eastern Tanzania. Previously recorded patterns of restricted distribution and high species turnover between forest patches in Kenya and Tanzania are confirmed. Seven coastal forest species were assessed as Endangered. Regional context and conservation - Coastal dry forests are discussed in relation to the more widespread 'sand forests' of the continental interior of south-central Africa, and shown to have similarities in ecology, species composition, soils and ecology. Very little of the present extent of coastal forests in Mozambique lies within protected areas. The threats to their continued existence in the face of exploitation for timber, agriculture and oil exploration are outlined.","The canopy of many central African forests is dominated by light-demanding tree species that do not regenerate well under themselves. The prevalence of these species might result from ancient slash-and-burn agricultural activities that created large openings, while a decline of these activities since the colonial period could explain their deficit of regeneration. To verify this hypothesis, we compared soil charcoal abundance, used as a proxy for past slash-and-burn agriculture, and tree species composition assessed on 208 rainforest 0.2 ha plots located in three areas from Southern Cameroon. Species were classified in regeneration guilds (pioneer, non-pioneer light-demanding, shade-bearer) and characterized by their wood-specific gravity, assumed to reflect light requirement. We tested the correlation between soil charcoal abundance and: (i) the relative abundance of each guild, (ii) each species and family abundance and (iii) mean wood-specific gravity. Charcoal was found in 83% of the plots, indicating frequent past forest fires. Radiocarbon dating revealed two periods of fires: “recent” charcoal were on average 300 years old (up to 860 BP, n = 16) and occurred in the uppermost 20 cm soil layer, while “ancient” charcoal were on average 1900 years old (range: 1500 to 2800 BP, n = 43, excluding one sample dated 9400 BP), and found in all soil layers. While we expected a positive correlation between the relative abundance of light-demanding species and charcoal abundance in the upper soil layer, overall there was no evidence that the current heterogeneity in tree species composition can be explained by charcoal abundance in any soil layer. The absence of signal supporting our hypothesis might result from (i) a relatively uniform impact of past slash-and-burn activities, (ii) pedoturbation processes bringing ancient charcoal to the upper soil layer, blurring the signal of centuries-old Human disturbances, or (iii) the prevalence of other environmental factors on species composition.","While most past studies have emphasized the relationships between specific forest stands and edaphic factors, recent observations in Central African moist forests suggested that an increase of slash-and-burn agriculture since 3000–2000 BP (Before Present) could be the main driver of the persistence of light-demanding tree species. In order to examine anthropogenic factors in the persistence of such populations, our study focused on Pericopsis elata, an endangered clustered timber species. We used a multidisciplinary approach comprised of botanical, anthracological and archaeobotanical investigations to compare P. elata patches with surrounding stands of mixed forest vegetation (“out-zones”). Charcoal samples were found in both zones, but were significantly more abundant in the soils of patches. Eleven groups of taxa were identified from the charcoals, most of them also present in the current vegetation. Potsherds were detected only inside P. elata patches and at different soil depths, suggesting a long human presence from at least 2150 to 195 BP, as revealed by our charcoal radiocarbon dating. We conclude that current P. elata patches most likely result from shifting cultivation that occurred ca. two centuries ago. The implications of our findings for the dynamics and management of light-demanding tree species are discussed.",26.4479852226964,0,Unlabeled

The results indicate that the availability of water, fuel-wood and fodder decreased, agricultural production declined and livelihood opportunities were reduced mainly due to depletion of natural resources. Consequently, the male out-migration increased by 15% during 1981–2011. This increased workload of women by 25%, more than 40% women are under severe threat of a variety of health risks generated mainly due to excess work-load, under-nourishment and lack of hygiene and sanitation.

Joshi members of the family (Maithani 1996). On the other hand, there is severe shortage of adult male labour to work in agriculture and other sectors of rural economy which further acts as a drag on agricultural productivity and retards the process of socio-economic development in the mountains. The cumulative impact of all these physical, socio-economic and cultural constraints in the mountains is leading to grinding poverty, hardship, constant fear of insecurity, a feeling of helplessness, and complete dependence on the outside help. The environment thus created is not conducive to attaining the goals of sustainable mountain development (Maithani 1996; Joshi and Tiwari 2013). During the recent past a variety of changes has emerged in traditional resource utilization pattern mainly in response to the population growth and resultant increased demand of natural resources, and to the global change, particularly economic globalisation, urbanization and climate change in the Himalayas (IOM 2008; Jain and Nagarwalla 2004; Tiwari and Joshi 2012a). Women experience these changes differently and disproportionately and respond to them in a varying manner because of socially constructed gender relations and environmental sensitivity of mountain ecosystems. They make use of their critical traditional knowledge of and experience with natural resource management and adapting agricultural and food systems to multiple drivers of environmental change, including climate change, globalisation and economic processes, out-migration, and land-use changes in mountain environments, which helped women to become an important agent of sustainable mountain development (ICIMOD 2011). However, these changes have exerted sharply accentuated pressures on local economy through depletion of land, water, biodiversity and forests resources, collapsing conventional production system and increasing community vulnerability to livelihood and food insecurity and increased risks of natural disasters (World Bank 2009; Lonergan 1998). This has augmented male out-migration, and consequently increased hardships of rural women and deteriorated their quality of life (Mamgain 2003; Tiwari and Joshi 2012b). Conceptual Background Mountains have long been marginalized from the view point of sustainable development of their resources and inhabitants. However, during the recent years our understanding about the problems of mountain regions and approach to their development has undergone drastic changes (ICIMOD 2010). This is reflected by a deepening anxiety over the depletion of natural resources and disruption of mountain ecosystem services. As a result, the significance of mountain social-ecological systems was acknowledged for the first time on a global scale in Agenda 21 of the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED), held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in 1992 (UN 2012). Mountains include some of the most fragile ecosystems on the planet (ICIMOD 2010) as they are highly sensitive to changes caused by natural as well as anthropogenic factors (Sonesson and Messerli 2002). The drivers of changes range from a variety on natural hazards and disasters to a series of human-induced processes such as population growth, depletion of natural resources, urbanization, economic globalisation and resultant intensification of land use (Tiwari 2000; ICIMOD 2011). Moreover, changing climatic conditions have put pressure on the mountain environments through higher mean annual temperatures and melting of glaciers and snow, altered precipitation patterns, and more frequent and extreme weather events 79 Environmental Changes, Rural Out-migration and Social Dynamics in Himalayas which are likely to intensify the impacts of other natural as well as socio-economic drivers of change (IPCC 2007; UNEP-WCMC 2002; CIDA 2002; Brody et al. 2008; Daley 2011). Subsistence agriculture, livestock raising and income generation through small scale trade, and wage and casual labour constitute the main source of livelihood of mountain communities (Leduc and Shrestha 2008). The Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) of the United Nations has identified more than 75% of the land surface of the world’s mountain as unsuitable or marginally suitable for agriculture (Huddleston and Ataman 2003; Messerli and Ives 1997; IFAD 2001). It has been observed that the proportion of poor and vulnerable people increases with elevation (Huddleston and Ataman 2003). There are indications that poverty inequality between mountain people and those living in other areas is currently increasing (ICIMOD 2010). Approximately, 271 million people, which accounts for nearly 40% of the mountain population in developing and transition countries, have been estimated to be highly vulnerable to food insecurity, specifically in Asia and Latin America (Huddleston and Ataman 2003; FAO 2008). High dependency on natural resources and increasing marginalisation are some of important factors for prevailing poverty, food and livelihood insecurity and poor community health, in mountains of developing countries which are further increasing their vulnerability to long-term impacts of global environmental changes (Huddleston and Ataman 2003). The globalizing economy has both positive as well as negative impacts on the mountain livelihoods and economy. The fast growing tourism industry in India, China and Nepal has opened new opportunities for the growth of mountain economy. Furthermore, China and India are the fastest growing economies in Asia, yet, they have the highest poverty ratios. Moreover, the economic globalisation have further increased the vulnerability of the mountain communities to the environmental risks through exploitation of natural resources even in remote and inaccessible areas, particularly in the developing countries. This seems to have further deepened poverty imbalances between highlands and lowlands (Hassan et al. 2005; Huddleston and Ataman 2003). However, for millennia the mountain communities were developing distinctive mechanisms to adapt to these typical conditions through evolving a range of adaptive measures (UNEP 2004; ICIMOD 2010). Migration of male youth is one the important adaptive measures to constraints of subsistence economy and changing environmental conditions and associated natural and socio-economic risks across all the mountain regions of the world (Sherpa 2007). On one hand, labour migration improves economic conditions and ensures food security in terms of remittance (Kollmair et al. 2006); on the other hand, it has inadvertently created a vacuum in the mountain societies, putting extra responsibilities on women (Sherpa 2007). During 1991–2000, the level of adult male out-migration in the mountainous regions of South Asia exceeded 40% (Rasmussen and Parvez 2002). Draining away of productive human resource from mountains has serious implications not only for the economic development, but also for the enrichment of socio-cultural life in the region (Maithani 1996). Women, being natural resource developers, possess undocumented indigenous knowledge, and their contribution towards preserving the mountain cultures and natural resources is highly significant (ICIMOD 1999). However, the depletion of natural resource base has affected women adversely by increasing their workload and marginality (UNDP 2010). As a result, women play crucial role in mountain societies as major work force in food production system and as key players in the conservation and management of natural re80 P. C. Tiwari • B. Joshi sources and environments (FAO 2010, 2011). Globally, women share is nearly 43% of the work force in agricultural sector, and mountain regions of Asia, Africa, and Latin America it is above 50% (Sherpa 2007). The combined hardship and adversity of mountain living conditions trained the women to respond radically to the forces that were exploiting their natural resources and undermining their livelihoods. Rural women’s active participation in the conservation and management of their natural resources laid the foundation for the well known environmental movements in the seventies (Verma 2001). The famous 'Chipko Movement' (hugging the trees movement) of Uttarakhand – a distinctly non-violent grassroots movement – was organized and lead by illiterate rural women against the exploitative state forestry policy in 1970s. However, women in the Himalayas are particularly vulnerable to the impacts of environmental changes due to skewed power relations and inequitable cultural and social norms, as a result, they are often disadvantaged in terms of power relations and accessing resources, and exposed to increased risks associated with environmental changes (ICIMOD 2010). These risks include further marginalization, exclusion from decision-making and dislocation from access to resources for survival. Women generally have far less access to and control over the resources they manage and conserve (Sherpa 2007). The women of the Hindu Kush Himalayas of Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, China","Ethiopia has the largest forest land resource in the horn of Africa with a total of 12.5 million hectares (ha).The livelihoods of most the peoples in the country are highly interlinked directly or indirectly with forest resources.  It plays enormous environmental, socio-economic significance and thereby contributes a great role in the sustainable development of the country as well. However, most of the forest resources of Ethiopia are highly exposed to degradation at an alarming rate. A century ago, forests covered about 40 % of the total landmass of the country. The spatial pattern of the forest has been shown a rapid decrement from 40% in 1900 to 16% in 1954, 8% in 1961, 4% in 1975, 3.2% in 1980 and now it is estimated to be less than 3%.  The spatiotemporal forest cover change in Ethiopia has been attributed to natural and more importantly manmade factors. The major drivers of forest cover decline can be grouped as proximate driving factors and underlying driving factors in Ethiopia. Proximate driving factors of  include; expansion of resettlement, expansion of agricultural practices and charcoal burning and cutting trees for fuel whereas, underlying driving factors include; economic, institutional, technological, cultural, demographic and biophysical factors. The alarming rates of forest degradation have been posing environmental, social and economic problems. The environmental implications of forest degradation are climate change, siltation of water bodies, and degradation of wetlands, soil erosion, and reduction in agricultural production. Therefore so as to reverse the current situation of forest degradation and maintain ecological balance, there has to be an inclusive responsibility by all levels of communities. The governmental and non-governmental organizations, farmers as well as the private sectors should play their own role in protecting the forest resources.

They help to regulate the water cycle, stabilize soils and moderate the climate of the Earth by absorbing and storing carbon dioxide. In addition to these environmental services, forests provide habitat to numerous species and are an important source of food, medicines and wood for humankind. In many countries, forests contribute importantly to their economic and social development through employment, the production and trade of forest products, and the protection and hosting of sites and landscapes of high cultural, spiritual or recreational value. As a result of the increase in human population and economic activities, larger volumes of forest products, particularly wood, were required, and the natural processes were insufficient to restore the damage imposed on the forests. At present, the total forest area in the world is estimated to be nearly 4,000 million hectares, which cover about 30 percent of the global land area. Although the forest cover is still extensive, the problem of deforestation continues at an alarming rate: according to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), in the 15 years from 1990 to 2005 the world lost 3 percent of its total forest area, representing an average decline of about 0.2 percent per year (FAO, 2007). Deforestation results from a combination of factors, including, among others, increased global demand for forest products, land-use change (e.g. conversion of forest into agriculture land) and the expansion of urban areas. A reduction in forest area can also happen through natural disasters, but deforestation is by far the most important cause of forest loss (FAO, 2007). Deforestation rates differ considerably from region to region, and figure 1 presents estimate data that illustrate the extent of losses and gains of forest land area around the world in the last two decades. It is interesting to note that deforestation is preponderant in developing countries in Latin America (with the notable exception of Cuba), Africa and Southeast Asia. The primary causes of this is the land-use change to agriculture and the production of fuelwood and charcoal through processes that are inefficient and lead to over-exploitation. Between years 2000 and 2010, however, net loss of forest area in the world decreased slightly, which is probably an indicator of the natural expansion of forests primarily due to efforts made to ensure the conservation of","It is a commonplace of geology that the surface of the earth is constantly in motion; that our mountain ranges have taken shape and our river courses and valleys have been excavated by rain, frost and wind. In many parts of the world this movement of the soil surface is taking place rapidly, with serious consequen- ces to the agriculture of those countries, owing to soil erosion. 1 The soil is dependent for its stability on its normal covering of vegetation, but as a rule the soil proper is not more than 6 inches to a foot deep, and it is in the surface layer that the fertility resides. There is thus always a danger that if the cover of vegetation is removed, the soil itself may shift under the action of either wind or rain. The earliest cases of erosion caused by such movement of the soil are those which follow deforestation in regions where the mountains in which the rivers take their rise are below the permanent snow line-e.g., in the eastern Mediterranean. There is no evidence in support of the belief that forests increase the rainfall of a country; indeed, by the transpiration from their leaves, they must reduce the total amount of the rainfall retained by the soil, but they serve as its regulator; as the rain falls, it is absorbed by the spongy soil below the trees, rich in humus, and reappears later in the springs and rivers when the rainy season is over. Too commonly, however, the forests have been cut down without regard to their regeneration, both for the value of their timber and for u desire to extend the grazing land.","Rain-fed farming is the primary livelihood of semi-arid west Africa. Changes in land cover have the potential to affect precipitation, the critical resource for production. Turbulent flux measurements from two eddy-covariance towers and additional observations from a dense network of small, wireless meteorological stations combine to relate land cover (savanna forest and agriculture) to evaporation in a small (3.5km2) catchment in Burkina Faso, west Africa. We observe larger sensible and latent heat fluxes over the savanna forest in the headwater area relative to the agricultural section of the watershed all year. Higher fluxes above the savanna forest are attributed to the greater number of exposed rocks and trees and the higher productivity of the forest compared to rain-fed, hand-farmed agricultural fields. Vegetation cover and soil moisture are found to be primary controls of the evaporative fraction. Satellite-derived vegetation index (NDVI) and soil moisture are determined to be good predictors of evaporative fraction, as indicators of the physical basis of evaporation. Our measurements provide an estimator that can be used to derive evaporative fraction when only NDVI is available. Such large-scale estimates of evaporative fraction from remotely sensed data are valuable where ground-based measurements are lacking, which is the case across the African continent and many other semi-arid areas. Evaporative fraction estimates can be combined, for example, with sensible heat from measurements of temperature variance, to provide an estimate of evaporation when only minimal meteorological measurements are available in remote regions of the world. These findings reinforce local cultural beliefs of the importance of forest fragments for climate regulation and may provide support to local decision makers and rural farmers in the maintenance of the forest areas.","Rain-fed farming is the primary livelihood of semi-arid West Africa. Changes in land cover have the potential to affect precipitation, the critical resource for production. Turbulent flux measurements from two eddy-covariance towers and additional observations from a dense network of small, wireless meteorological stations combine to relate land cover (savanna forest and agriculture) to evaporation in a small (3.5 km 2 ) catchment in Burkina Faso, West Africa. We observe larger sensible and latent heat fluxes over the savanna-forest in the headwater area relative to the agricultural section of the watershed. Fluxes above the savanna-forest are higher because of the greater number of exposed rocks and trees and the higher productivity of the forest compared to rainfed, hand-farmed agricultural fields. We deduce that there is a higher soil heat flux in the fields. Vegetation cover and soil moisture are found to be the primary controls of the evaporative fraction, defined as the latent heat over the available energy. Satellite derived vegetation index (NDVI) and soil moisture are determined to be good predictors of evaporative fraction. Our measurements provide an estimator that can be used to estimate evaporative fraction when only NDVI is available. Such large-scale estimates of evaporative fraction from remotely sensed data are valuable where ground-based measurements are lacking, which is the case across the African continent and many other semi-arid areas. Evaporative fraction estimates can be combined, for example, with sensible heat from measurements of temperature variance, to provide an estimate of evaporation when only minimal meteorological measurements are available in remote regions of the world. These findings reinforce local cultural beliefs of the importance of forest fragments for climate regulation and may provide support to local decision makers and rural farmers in the maintenance of the forest areas.","Genetic modification has gotten a hostile reception from activists who claim to be protecting the planet. But the most powerful underlying emotion for their unreasoned fear—rapid human population growth—is rapidly becoming irrelevant. Will biotechnology overcrowd the planet by saving more sick people while producing more food to fuel more population growth? In a word, no. The opposition of the eco-activists is ironic, at least. Without the Green Revolution's high-yield farming, the world would already have had to clear most or all of its 16 million square miles of forests to produce today's food supply. Plant breeding, chemical fertilizers, irrigation pumps, and pesticides have been the key technologies to date in “growing more food per acre to leave more room for nature.” But each of these advances in farming has been pilloried by activist groups who claim to fear insect-protected cotton (that helps prevent devastation of the textile-dependent economies in China and India), vitamin-A-enriched “golden” rice (to prevent blindness in poor Asian children), and blight-resistant potatoes (that could prevent a re-enactment of the Irish potato famine in potato-dependent Bangladesh). Why are these people not joyful about the conservation benefits of high-yield farming? Apparently because they fear growing more food will mean even larger human populations. Fearing overpopulation was understandable in the 1960s, when the Green Revolution was suddenly tripling Asian crop yields and DDT began preventing millions of malaria deaths. Today, however, the world is 40 years into the first era when bigger harvests mean better nutrition for children instead of more people. The world's population surge is losing its steam, even though the number of people added each year is still near all-time highs. In a completely unexpected development, world birth rates per women have plummeted as radically as death rates in the era of modern medicine. Third world birth rates have come three-fourths of the way to stability, having dropped from 6.2 births per women in 1960 to 3.1 today. (Stability is 2.1.) This trend in birth rates is massive and unprecedented. The UN Population Division has just—again—lowered its estimate of the peak human population, this time to between 8 and 9 billions. (We are at 6.3 billions now.) Poor farmers almost always have big families, but affluent urban couples almost always have two children or less. The entire world (except Africa) is now on the path to urban affluence. Africa, eventually, will find its way along the same path. The eco-activists seem equally unaware that the UN Environmental Program's new Atlas of Biodiversity notes the world lost only half as many species (a combined 20 birds, mammals, and fish) to extinction in the last third of the 20th century as in the last third of the 19th century. Why the dramatic improvement? In the 19th century, man was clearing lots of forest to plant more low-yield crops. Today, we are raising yields and planting high-yield tree plantations for our lumber needs. Meanwhile, the World Conservation Union (IUCN) worries most about the one billion poor people living in the world's biodiversity hot spots, and trying to feed their families by hunting bushmeat and slash-and-burn farming. Only biotechnology is likely to provide new answers to the needs of these third world peasant farmers. But won't more (and more affluent) people inevitably take more resources away from nature? Again, no. Stone-age hunters had to exploit natural resources. That is why they eradicated dozens of mammal and bird species in North America, including our horses, camels, and ground sloths. Today, biotechnology can create new resources. Bacillus thuringiensis varieties are producing 80 percent more cotton per acre in India and 80 percent more corn per acre in the Philippines because they deal more effectively with the potentially ruinous tropical pests. That effectively creates more cropland. Biotechnology tomatoes can grow in far saltier water, which effectively creates new water supplies. The eco-activists propose to “solve” the food problem by subtracting resources, most notably the 80 million tons of natural nitrogen that conventional farmers take from the air each year to make “chemical” fertilizer for their crops. Organic farming, ardently promoted by the environmentalists, bans “synthetic” nitrogen. The world would need the manure from another 7 to 8 billion cattle (and 3 to 30 acres of forage per beast) to supply all-organic nitrogen today, and far more by 2050. The organic “solution” would immediately force us to clear virtually all the world's wildlands to grow clover—or doom one-third of the world's human population. Apparently, the eco-activists would like to solve the competition for land between people and wildlife by eliminating people. But in the 21st century, with rising farm productivity and rapidly declining birth rates, setting the needs of people and wildlife needlessly against each other is both inhumane and environmentally irresponsible. Genetic engineering, both in medicine and agriculture, is good for people and the planet.","Currently, ~65% of extant primate species (ca 512 species) distributed in 91 countries in the Neotropics, mainland Africa, Madagascar, South Asia and Southeast Asia are threatened with extinction and 75% have declining populations as a result of deforestation and habitat loss resulting from increasing global market demands, and land conversion for industrial agriculture, cattle production and natural resource extraction. Other pressures that negatively impact primates are unsustainable bushmeat hunting, the illegal trade of primates as pets and as body parts, expanding road networks in previously isolated areas, zoonotic disease transmission and climate change. Here we examine current and future trends in several socio-economic factors directly or indirectly affecting primates to further our understanding of the interdependent relationship between human well-being, sustainable development, and primate population persistence. We found that between 2001 and 2018 ca 191 Mha of tropical forest (30% canopy cover) were lost as a result of human activities in the five primate range regions. Forty-six percent of this loss was in the Neotropics (Mexico, Central and South America), 30% in Southeast Asia, 21% in mainland Africa, 2% in Madagascar and 1% in South Asia. Countries with the greatest losses (ca 57% of total tree cover loss) were Brazil, Indonesia, DRC, China, and Malaysia. Together these countries harbor almost 50% of all extant primate species. In 2018, the world human population was estimated at ca 8bn people, ca 60% of which were found in primate range countries. Projections to 2050 and to 2100 indicate continued rapid growth of the human populations in these five primate range regions, with Africa surpassing all the other regions and totaling ca 4bn people by the year 2100. Socioeconomic indicators show that, compared to developed nations, most primate range countries are characterized by high levels of poverty and income inequality, low human development, low food security, high levels of corruption and weak governance. Models of Shared Socioeconomic Pathway scenarios (SSPs) projected to 2050 and 2100 showed that whereas practices of increasing inequality (SSP4) or unconstrained growth in economic output and energy use (SSP5) are projected to have dire consequences for human well-being and primate survivorship, practices of sustainability-focused growth and equality (SSP1) are expected to have a positive effect on maintaining biodiversity, protecting environments, and improving the human condition. These results stress that improving the well-being, health, and security of the current and future human populations in primate range countries are of paramount importance if we are to move forward with effective policies to protect the world’s primate species and promote biodiversity conservation.","Forests play an important role in maintaining rainfall patterns worldwide by recycling water back to the atmosphere through evapotranspiration. We present a novel spatiotemporal data-driven model and assessment of the impacts of various deforestation scenarios on rainfall patterns in sub-Saharan Africa, where rainfed agriculture is the main source of income and provides food for a large part of the population. Our model is based on the convolutional long short term memory neural network and uses a combination of climate and vegetation time-series data to predict rainfall and to perform simulation experiments. Our results show that complete deforestation (i.e. conversion of all humid forests to short grasslands) would greatly reduce rainfall magnitude in the deforested areas. Above the equator, the large majority of areas not currently forested would also receive less rainfall. However, complete deforestation would slightly increase rainfall in some parts of Southern Africa and decrease it in other parts. The impacts of partial deforestation also differ across Africa. In West Africa, even moderate tree cover loss (i.e. 30%) reduces rainfall magnitude whereas in Central and Southern Africa, a threshold of 70% tree cover loss is required to reduce rainfall magnitude. Deforestation of remaining humid rainforest areas is thus likely to dramatically affect rainfed agriculture across the continent, in particular in the maize-based cropping systems north of the equator.","Abstract. A new generation of an Earth system model now includes a number of land-surface processes directly relevant to analyzing potential impacts of climate change. This model, HadGEM2-ES, allows us to assess the impacts of climate change, multiple interactions, and feedbacks as the model is run. This paper discusses the results of century-scale HadGEM2-ES simulations from an impacts perspective – specifically, terrestrial ecosystems and water resources – for four different scenarios following the representative concentration pathways (RCPs), used in the Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC, 2013, 2014). Over the 21st century, simulated changes in global and continental-scale terrestrial ecosystems due to climate change appear to be very similar in all 4 RCPs, even though the level of global warming by the end of the 21st century ranges from 2 °C in the lowest scenario to 5.5° in the highest. A warming climate generally favours broadleaf trees over needleleaf, needleleaf trees over shrubs, and shrubs over herbaceous vegetation, resulting in a poleward shift of temperate and boreal forests and woody tundra in all scenarios. Although climate related changes are slightly larger in scenarios of greater warming, the largest differences between scenarios arise at regional scales as a consequence of different patterns of anthropogenic land cover change. In the model, the scenario with the lowest global warming results in the most extensive decline in tropical forest cover due to a large expansion of agriculture. Under all four RCPs, fire potential could increase across extensive land areas, particularly tropical and sub-tropical latitudes. River outflows are simulated to increase with higher levels of CO2 and global warming in all projections, with outflow increasing with mean temperature at the end of the 21st century at the global scale and in North America, Asia, and Africa. In South America, Europe, and Australia, the relationship with climate warming and CO2 rise is less clear, probably as a result of land cover change exerting a dominant effect in those regions.",17.3368406690988,4,Unlabeled

Land is a principal factor of production, a source of life and livelihoods. It provides a means of living and a variety of uses such as agricultural, human settlement, environmental conservation, urban and industrial development purposes among others. These uses compete for space in a fixed area, hence the rising land use conflicts and degradation. The situation has threatened lives and livelihoods, making it difficult to plan for the livelihood activities in the County. This is happening against the backdrop of land use policy changes including; sessional paper no 3 of 2009 on the National Land Policy, the Constitution of Kenya 2010, the Land Act, 2012, the Land Registration Act, 2012, the Community Land Act, 2016 and sessional paper no 1 of 2017 on National Land Use Policy that were intended to alleviate the situation. This situation is now a major threat to the livelihood of the local communities in Baringo County. This study, therefore, sought to examined the dynamics of land use changes on the livelihood of the local communities in Baringo county with specific objective to establish the drivers of the changes. A comprehensive desk review of existing literature was done, and land use changes were descriptively analyzed. The review spanned from pre-colonial (before 1895), colonial (1895 to 1963), independence (1963 to 2010) including the subsequent years of land reforms following the promulgation of the Constitution of Kenya 2010 onwards to 2020. The study found that the key drivers of land use changes originate from the change of land use policies from customary to European-like systems during the colonial era (1895 to 1963). These drivers revolve around the conflicts in the application of land use policies and laws, dual production system (different land use for registered private land in arable areas and the unregistered community land in non-arable areas within the county) occasioning wide productivity gap and economic disparity. Further the knowledge gaps associated with colonial perceptions, ideologies, and attitudinal International Journal of Academic Research in Business and Social Sciences Vol. 1 1 , No. 9, 2021, E-ISSN: 2222-6990 © 2021 HRMARS 562 practices, which led to misconception and wrong policies aggravated the situation. The consequences disorganize the local community land use and social system, broke down the traditional grazing and cropping patterns, depleted soils fertility & degraded the environment. In addition, the study found out that in the unregistered community land, land use conflicts were rampant, and characterized by invaded and claim interest as well as unscrupulous legal manipulation of land ownership records leading to dispossession. These two salient features are the main drivers of land use changes that led to continuous and frequent fatal inter-ethnic land use conflicts among the local communities; causing displacement and destruction of property among other atrocities working against politically weak local community. This scenario destabilized livelihood possibilities making it difficult for local communities to engage in basic livelihood activities and create uncertainty for future development. The study concluded that the security of land tenure perpetrates land use conflicts particularly in the unregistered community land. The government, therefore, need to register the community land to enhance land tenure security in the county. Background of the Study The background of the study covers introduction, problem statement, objectives Introduction Globally, land resource is the basis of human livelihood, since it provides basic needs such as food, water, energy, clothing and shelter. It allows for a variety of uses including agricultural production, human settlement and environmental conservation to preserve it for posterity, and can satisfy a diverse range of local communities’ livelihood objectives. All these uses of land resource compete for space in a fixed land area within an ever-changing environment. In addition, it is a finite resource and increasingly becoming scarce over time. The ensuing competition and growing forces at work necessitates government intervention through land use policy in order to harmonize the various uses. Moreover, in practice, it is difficult to arrive to an equilibrium between the various uses without an external force. Therefore, the unfolding scenario leads to land use changes problems, which calls for government intervention through land use policies. Land use policy is intended to balance users demands, facilitate production and sustain livelihood for the local communities and at same time guarantee political stability. In this study, dynamics of land use changes is defined as policy changes and the resultant consequences. In Africa, dynamics of land use changes evolved through various transformations associated with government policies adopted by different political regimes. The changes were traced from the precolonial, colonial and post-colonial eras. Each of these eras introduced changes in land use policies that shape up different social, economic and political realities on the livelihood of the local communities. Livelihood is defined as comprising the capabilities, assets (including both material and social resources) and activities required for a means of living by the local communities (Scones, 2008). Livelihood is sustainable when it can cope with the policy changes, and recover from, stresses and shocks arising from it, maintain or enhance local communities’ capabilities, assets and activities, while not undermining the natural resources base. In this case, land resource represents the natural resource base, and the capacity of the local communities to use it to generate and maintain their means of living, enhance their well-being and preserve it for future generations is dependent on policy changes. These changes influence greatly the livelihood outcomes of the local communities. International Journal of Academic Research in Business and Social Sciences Vol. 1 1 , No. 9, 2021, E-ISSN: 2222-6990 © 2021 HRMARS 563 In this respect, local communities are indigenous populations who reside and derive their livelihood from land resource. They consider land resource as the principal factor of production and the source of livelihood because it provides basic needs such as food, water, energy, clothing and shelter. Land resource also allows for a variety of uses including agricultural, human settlement and environmental conservation that satisfy a diverse range of livelihood objectives for local communities. In Kenya, dynamics of land use changes emanates largely from colonial regime actions and policies, which continued in slightly modified manner after independence (Thuo, 2013). Before the colonial era (before 1895), land use was managed through African local communities’ customary laws. Land use and management practices were guided and controlled by established regulations and procedures among various local communities (Thuo, 2013). Land use was organized into specific areas of agricultural (crops and livestock), human settlement, environmental conservation uses and heritage sites, among others. Most of the land resource was owned by the entire community while individual community members had only user rights (Thuo, 2013). The land use was communal, small-scale subsistence in nature, stable and sustainable in terms of provision for local communities’ livelihood and environmental conservation needs. The period depicts a close economy without government intervention in terms of land use policy changes. Local communities enjoy territorial niches with boundaries defined by specific geographical and physical features such as rivers, mountains, trees, and valleys. The ethnic community chiefs, assisted by the Council of elders, had the power to make land use decisions. Land use was assumed to operate in a dynamic equilibrium checked by raids and natural disasters such as war, disease outbreaks, earthquakes and famines. Soil fertility was maintained through shift cultivation with adequate fallow periods of three (3) years or more required to restore soil structure and fertility. Much of the uncultivated land was used as pastoral communities grazing areas. Forested areas were used for hunting, trapping and honey gathering. Periodic droughts checked Land use and inter communities’ raids to maintain the dynamic equilibrium. During colonial era(1895 to 1963), the colonial government took over the control of land use from the local communities through violence, trickery, and mutual agreements (Thuo, 2013). It dismantled the ethnic community territorial niches and nationalized land use. All land in Kenya became Crown Land. All local communities were dispossessed, and customary land use laws by the local communities were rendered redundant. All existing land use rights by the local communities were at the mercy of the colonial power (Okoth-Ogendo, 1995). Therefore, the genesis of land use problems in Kenya. Fundamentally, the land use policy changes were biased and oriented to benefit European settlers with scant attention to local communities. The land use policies created a dual land use system where the European colonists occupy the high rainfall and fertile areas, employing modern land use practices based on individuals’ decisions. At the same time, the local communities were restricted to native reserves in the drier regions, where local communities were allowed to continue with collective land use decisions. These land use changes promoted economic disparity between European settler and local communities during colonial era. Land use policies promoted high productivity land use practices for European white farmers, while encouraging low productivity traditional land use practices for local communities. The land use policy c","Agroforestry is one of the most conspicuous land use systems across landscapes and agro ecological zones in Africa. Some of the components of Agroforestry systems are; home garden agroforestry, alley cropping, forest farming, wind break, river banks, park land, crop land trees and buffer zones agroforestry practices. Climate change impacts by complex weather-related phenomena have threatened agricultural and forest ecosystems and the livelihood of agricultural and local communities. Agroforestry has an important role in climate change adaptation through diversified land-use practices, sustainable livelihoods, sources of income, enhanced forest and agricultural productivity and reduced weather-related production losses, which enhance resilience against climate impacts. Like few other land use options, agroforestry has real potential to contribute to food security, climate change mitigation and adaptation, while preserving and strengthening the environmental resource base of Africa’s rural landscapes. It has a key role to play in landscape-scale mitigation schemes under the REDD+or AFOLU (Agriculture, Forestry and other land uses) concepts. Home garden agroforestry system indicates that adaptation and mitigation to climate change will largely depend on the increased resilience of both agroforestry systems and of local management capacity. Despite less attention has been given to tree based land use option, agroforestry has played a major role in reducing household vulnerability to shocking. Smallholder farmers have already started mainstreaming tree based land use system as resilience to social needs because the poor are more exposed to change; Agroforestry is one of best risk aversion option to make them move out of food insecurity. Generally, agroforestry systems readily bundle both mitigation and adaptation strategies and provide several pathways to securing food security for poor farmers, while contributing to climate change mitigation. Agroforestry should attract more attention in global agendas on climate adaptation and mitigation because of its positive social and environmental impacts.","The Maasai Mara and the wider Mau River Basin in East Africa provide fundamental ecosystem services that support people, wildlife, livestock and agriculture. The historical indigenous land use of the Mara and wider Mau basin was wildlife conservation and pastoralism with highland agriculture. However, land policy changes, the rise of community conservancies and the increase in human populations have mediated unprecedented land use shifts over time. We analyze land use and land cover change (LULCC) trends from 1990 to 2040 in the Mara and the wider Mau River Basin landscape. The study examines land use and land cover change trends, establishes factors driving the trends, and assesses the implications of these trends on biodiversity. Multi-temporal satellite images, together with physical and social economic data, were collated to generate future scenarios for transitions for forest, shrubland, grassland, cropland, wetlands and built-up areas between 1990 and 2040. Agricultural expansion is the chief driver of LULCC in the Mara and the wider Mau River Basin, particularly since 2015. There was insignificant change to the forest cover after 2015, which was in part due to government intervention on forest encroachment and boundaries. The anthropogenic choice of tilling the land in the basin caused a decline in grasslands, forests and expanded shrublands, particularly where there was clear tree cutting in the Mau forest. Land use and land cover trends have generated undesirable impacts on ecosystem services that support wildlife conservation.","Parkland agroforestry practice can provide different environmental services, especially for biodiversity conservation. This practice gets big attention with agroforestry and conservation scientists. The main purpose of this paper was to explore what are the main ecosystems services and livelihood strategy of parkland agroforestry provide to farming communities in West Africa region and the main challenges faced in conservation and management of the diversity of these trees in agricultural landscapes. What are the best practices and concerns towards parkland agroforestry in West African countries have and what lessons can be drawn to their counterparts in East African farming communities.The contributions and challenges of parkland agroforestry practices were described by different scholars. In West Africa`s region parklands as anthropogenic landscapes with a rational land use system developed by farmers over many generations and farmers select and protect tree species to diversify production for subsistence and income as well as to minimize environmental risks related to climatic variability. The contribution to the conservation of biodiversity through in situ conservation of tree species on farm, reduction of pressure on remnant forests, and the provision of suitable habitat for a number of plants and animal species on farmlands. Besides, planted trees and shrubs contribute significantly to farmers’ livelihoods by supplying food, fodder, wood and medicine. The main challenges are poor survival rate of seedlings due to moisture stress and browsing, careless field clearing and weeding, and the presence of seedlings seemed to be determined mainly by moisture availability and seed availability. In conclusion parkland in West Africa covers wide part of the agricultural landscapes providing enormous services and products to the farming communities of the region. Then the best practices accumulated in West Africa have to be transfered to East Africa through linking the agroforestry expertes and the farmers of the two regions.

A major challenge is to reduce the vulnerability of people and climate-sensitive sectors, including water, agriculture, and energy, to today?s climate variability and to ensure that future development activities are appropriate to future climate contexts. Through an Ecosystem-based Adaptation (EbA) research approach this project will help to inform rural stakeholders and national policy makers in East Africa regarding the sustainability of different local and national adaptation strategies. The research approaches will integrate a review of the climate change adaptation policy contexts with local level analyses of stakeholder vulnerability, and roles of forest and tree-based ecosystem services in promoting resilience of agriculture production. Based on these research outputs a participatory approach will be used to develop effective adaptation strategies targeted at different local and national stakeholder groups. This research project will target select communities on the Kenyan and Ugandan slopes of Mt. Elgon, known as one of the five water towers of Kenya. This project will be led by the Center for International Forestry Research (CIFOR). The research team conducting this project comprises two international centers of scientific excellence focussed specifically on forestry and agroforestry-science (CIFOR and the World Agroforestry Center), with one institution in Uganda (Makerere University) and one in Kenya (KEFRI) and that have led the development of long-term studies on forest based governance and livelihoods in their respective countries. Together, this group of institutions assembles leading scientists in their respective fields, providing this project with expertise in climate and ecosystem modelling, analysis of vulnerability and governance institutions, understandings of national and sub-national policy debates around climate change adaptation, and both the knowledge of research contexts and stakeholder rapport at sub-/national levels needed to ensure successful research and policy maker engagement. This project represents a continuation of the Rockefeller Foundation?s commitment to facilitating the development of East African excellence in research around climate change issues. This collaboration between CIFOR and the World Agroforestry Center is also consistent with the new realignment of Consultative Group for International Agricultural Research (CGIAR) research efforts, specifically through the development of the CGIAR Research Program 6 (CRP6) entitled: Forests, Trees and Agroforestry: Livelihoods, Landscapes and Governance.","This article sets out to unravel aspects of environmental changes in the Upper Tana during the second millennium AD. This aspect has not been adequately addressed in the Upper Tana. This makes it clear that a lacuna exists in the study of communities of the Upper Tana and the way they interact with their environment in the past and present times. The objective of this article is to evaluate the relationship between human activities and environmental change in the Upper Tana from AD 1000 to 1950. It is hypothesized that the advent of iron technology and its attendant economic activities led to the depletion of indigenous forests and the general environmental degradation. The article has employed archaeological, ethnographic, oral and historical methodologies to gather data on vegetation change in the Upper Tana and other related regions.  The article, argues that livestock grazing, iron smelting, slush and burn agriculture, and the clearing of forests for housing are key contributors to vegetation change in the Upper Tana.  Results from oral reconstruction of the past vegetation of the area, and using the plant succession theory, shows that the lowland area of the Upper Tana is actually savanna with scattered trees probably inhabited by grazers. It is posited that the above factors, together with persistent droughts have altered the vegetation cover of the area.  What we have today is colonization of less desirable stunted growth. The theory advanced here is that the vegetation change has been a result of human activities.  Overwhelmingly, results the study that the researcher carried out, showed that the causes of these changes have been socio-economically associated with the expansion of agricultural communities into the area; rather than through climatic factors. Colonisation and other forces of modernistion have also contributed to the underlying problem. The article concludes that anthropogenetic factors have greatly contributed to environmental change in the upper Tana. Certainly, environmental change is a global phenomenon that has elicited research interests due to its negative impacts on human population. It is recommended that knowledge of environmental change in the past should be used to extrapolate modern environmental challenges affecting African ecosystems.","This paper follows the transition from ethnobotany to a deeper scientific understanding of the food and medicinal properties of African agroforestry tree products as inputs into the start of domestication activities. It progresses on to the integration of these indigenous trees as new crops within diversified farming systems for multiple social, economic and environmental benefits. From its advent in the 1990s, the domestication of indigenous food and non-food tree species has become a global programme with a strong African focus. This review of progress in the third decade is restricted to progress in Africa, where multi-disciplinary research on over 59 species has been reported in 759 research papers in 318 science publications by scientists from over 833 research teams in 70 countries around the world (532 in Africa). The review spans 23 research topics presenting the recent research literature for tree species of high priority across the continent, as well as that in each of the four main ecological regions: the humid zone of West and Central Africa; the Sahel and North Africa; the East African highlands and drylands; and the woody savannas of Southern Africa. The main areas of growth have been the nutritional/medicinal value of non-timber forest products; the evaluation of the state of natural resources and their importance to local people; and the characterization of useful traits. However, the testing of putative cultivars; the implementation of participatory principles; the protection of traditional knowledge and intellectual property rights; and the selection of elite trees and ideotypes remain under-researched. To the probable detriment of the upscaling and impact in tropical agriculture, there has been, at the international level, a move away from decentralized, community-based tree domestication towards a laboratory-based, centralized approach. However, the rapid uptake of research by university departments and national agricultural research centres in Africa indicates a recognition of the importance of the indigenous crops for both the livelihoods of rural communities and the revitalization and enhanced outputs from agriculture in Africa, especially in West Africa. Thus, on a continental scale, there has been an uptake of research with policy relevance for the integration of indigenous trees in agroecosystems and their importance for the attainment of the UN Sustainable Development Goals. To progress this in the fourth decade, there will need to be a dedicated Centre in Africa to test and develop cultivars of indigenous crops. Finally, this review underpins a holistic approach to mitigating climate change, as well as other big global issues such as hunger, poverty and loss of wildlife habitat by reaping the benefits, or ‘profits’, from investment in the five forms of Capital, described as ‘land maxing’. However, policy and decision makers are not yet recognizing the potential for holistic and transformational adoption of these new indigenous food crop opportunities for African agriculture. Is ‘political will’ the missing sixth capital for sustainable development?","The East African drylands cover about 47% of the land surface and host about 20 million people. Rural people living in the drylands are mainly pastoralists who depend on livestock for both economic and social well-being. During the dry season, pastoralists apply strategic mobility to access grazing resources efficiently. However, this strategy has experienced change and constraints due to various demographic- and climate-related challenges. Pastoral lands have been cleared for large-scale agriculture while pastoralists have shifted towards agro-pastoralism. This has eroded many dryland trees and forests leading to environmental degradation. This review discusses important indigenous trees that can be utilized in ecological restoration of drylands as well as providing ecosystem goods and services. These include trees for gums and resins (Acacia, Commiphora and Boswellia), indigenous fruit trees (IFTs) (Adansonia digitata, Tamarindus indica and Balanites aegyptiaca), trees for wood (Melia volkensii and Terminalia brownie) and fodder (Acacia tortilis and Faidherbia albida). They are not only drought-tolerant but also have minimal disruption to the ecosystem. Various dryland restoration strategies and constraints are also discussed. For successful establishment, seedling planting should be integrated with other appropriate practices such as natural regeneration, silviculture and enrichment planting for sustainable dryland management.  Key words: Ecological restoration, drylands, indigenous trees, pastoralism.","As the topic of gender and forests gains international attention through programs related to addressing the Sustainable Development Goals, we focus on a case study of the African Locust Bean (Parkia biglobosa) in the savannah landscape of northern Ghana. Although this tree holds high cultural significance for Dagomba women, it is unfortunately becoming scarcer in our study area near Tamale. We investigate the reasons for this decline in relation to the agricultural, ecological, and cultural landscape and discuss the gendered impacts of these changes. Research in these communities was conducted between 2018 and 2021 as part of a transdisciplinary action research approach to process underutilized species with women’s groups. The research started with a survey that included 27 women’s groups in 13 communities with 524 women participants. Out of a selected number of groups, our research team has worked more intensively with three women’s groups near Nyankpala, which selected for their processing focus the African Locust Bean, locally known as dawadawa. More than 45 group sessions were organized with seven groups in a collaborative learning process in 2019. Additionally, the three groups in Kpachi who chose to process the African Locust Bean sustained facilitation of group activities until the end of 2021. Specifically, on the topic of the decline of this tree, 19 semistructured interviews were conducted in August 2020 with 8 female farmers, 7 male farmers and 4 chiefs in the local governance system. Our results show the cultural significance of the African Locust Bean for women in the Dagomba culture as well as practical uses of all parts of the tree. Specifically, the seeds are used for making a fermented condiment and tea. Although seeds of the African Locust Bean are considered a women’s crop, their access to this tree is mediated by the local chiefs and often male land-users. Most farmers interviewed reported a reduction in trees in their fields. The reasons for the decrease can be summarized in six different categories, (1) aging tree populations, (2) challenge caring for saplings until maturity, (3) agricultural changes with increased mechanization and pesticide use, (4) over-use as a firewood resource, (5) usufruct rights between traditional chiefs, male land-owners, and women who should be granted access to the trees according to Dagomba cultural values, and (6) reduced water availability inhibits seed yield. In conclusion, there is an urgent need for action to protect and restore the African Locust Bean within northern Ghana’s savannah landscape to ensure continued access and benefits of the tree to women in the region.","ABSTRACT Land systems are described based on various characteristics, including land cover composition and agricultural production. However, it is uncertain to what extent livestock, particularly monogastric livestock, determines land systems. We included monogastrics in a land system classification, and statistically analyzed the land cover composition and agricultural production of otherwise similar land systems with and without monogastric livestock. The results indicate that land systems with monogastrics are statistically different from their counterparts in the classification without monogastrics in terms of grassland area and crop yields, but are less different in terms of tree area, crop area, and ruminant livestock production. We then used a land systems map that includes monogastrics in the classification and a similar map that does not include monogastrics to project future changes in a novel manner that integrates livestock as a determinant of land systems. The results show that including monogastrics in otherwise similar projections yields less cropland intensification and more cropland expansion in several world regions, including Northern Africa and the Middle East. Other regions, such as Europe and Australia, were characterized by less decrease or more increase in tree area in the application with monogastrics, mainly due to the occurrence of open forests with monogastrics. This study prompts a call for improved characterization of land systems for land use and cover change (LUCC) assessments in order to better represent LUCC driven by monogastric livestock.",18.1503793824869,3,Unlabeled

A total of 155 genotypes randomly chosen from the four subsets were analyzed for random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) variation. Nine decamer primers generated a total of 43 fragments, 42 of which were polymorphic across the 155 genotypes. Pairwise distances were calculated between germplasm subsets using the distance metric algorithm in S-PLUS, and used to examine intra-and inter-subset variance components by analysis of molecular variation (AMOVAR). A phenogram based on unweighted pair group method with arithmetic average (UPGMA) cluster analysis was constructed from the pairwise distances and a scatter plot was generated from principal coordinate analysis. The AMOVAR showed that most of the variation in the germplasm (94.6%) was found within subsets, suggesting that there is significant variation among the germplasm. The grouping of genotypes based on the phenogram and scatter plot generally did not reflect the pedigree or provenance of the genotypes. It is possible that more RAPD markers are needed for determining genetic relationships in apple germplasm. Nevertheless, the variation observed in the study suggests that the current practice of sublining populations in the first generation to control inbreeding may not be necessary in subsequent generations. If these results are confirmed by fully informative molecular markers, germplasm managers should reassess the structure of their genetics populations. There may be a need to combine sublines in order to capture the maximum genetic diversity available and to streamline breeding efforts. genetic resources in germplasm collections and successive stages of development in breeding programs. More specifically, knowledge of genetic diversity and relationships among sets of germplasm and the potential merit of the genetic diversity is critical to plant improvement (Lee, 1995). In 1990, the Horticulture and Food Research Institute of New Zealand Limited (HortResearch), established a population improvement program to broaden the genetic base and, at the same time study the genetics of horticulturally important traits in apples. An apple genetics population was developed from imported seed and pollen from apple cultivars and varieties from clonal repositories in major apple producing regions in Europe, North America, Australia, Asia and South Africa (Noiton and Shelbourne, 1992). Seeds of accessions of Malus sieversii (Lebed.) were also obtained from Kazakhstan—the presumed center of origin of the cultivated apples (Hokanson et al., 1997). These seedlings have been planted in research orchards in a recurrent selection breeding strategy and maintained at multiple sites to allow for evaluation of general and regionally important horticultural traits and biotic and abiotic resistances. We as germplasm managers now need to assess the level of diversity within this collection to help make informed decisions on management procedures as well as on the choice of breeding strategies to use in combining horticulturally important traits in our breeding program. Historically, assessments of genetic composition of germplasm collections have been carried out at several levels including inferences based on reproductive biology, ecogeographic data, morphology, pigmentation, ontogeny, social history, pedigree records, breeding behavior, in situ and ex situ evaluation of traits, chromosome structure and behavior, protein markers, and molecular markers such as restricted fragment length polymorReceived for publication 10 July 2000.

The consequences of loss of genetic diversity have been experienced sporadically throughout history, often with significant human and economic costs, which has been a common problem with many of the world’s important food crops (Way et al., 1990). The genus Malus (apples), is characterized by large diversity, but thus far this has not been translated in the cultivated (Malus sylvestris (L) Mill. var. domestica (Borkh.) Mansf.) varieties (Way et al., 1990). Modern commercial apple orchards are dominated by only a few cultivars and many breeding programs utilize only a few well known cultivars in crosses for commercial apple production (Noiton and Shelbourne, 1992; Way et al., 1990). As a result, levels of inbreeding and coancestry in modern apples have been projected to increase (Noiton and Alspach, 1996). Awareness of genetic diversity and management of crop genetic resources have been important components of plant improvement programs. The foundation of crop-based agriculture rests largely on the availability and knowledge of extant plant phisms (RLFPs). The emergence of new polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based molecular markers, such as randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) markers, simple sequence repeats (SSRs), and amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs), has created opportunities to characterize germplasm collections at the molecular level, with markers that are presumably selectively neutral and not affected in their expression by environmental effects. The increased levels of variation detectable with these molecular markers have allowed germplasm managers, plant breeders, and geneticists to pursue with new vigor important questions relating to crops and their genetic resources (Bretting and Widrlechner, 1995). RAPD analyses have various scientific, operational, and budgetary advantages for genome mapping (Welsh and McClelland, 1990, 1991; Williams et al., 1990) and are used with a high degree of success as tools for harnessing genes from germplasm resources in our own apple genome mapping program (Gardiner et al., 1996a, 1999). These same advantages also appear valid for characterization of genetic variation for effective germplasm conservation and use, hence research in population genetics has shown the most growth with respect to the use of RAPD technology (Hedrick, 1992). RAPD markers have been used to create DNA fingerprints for the study of individual identity and taxonomic relationships in both eucaryotic and procaryotic organisms (Caetano-Anolles et al., 1991; Hu and Quiros, 1991; Kresovich et al., 1992); in apples, to differentiate cultivars (Koller et al., 1993), for paternity analysis (Harada et al., 1993), for determining genetic relationships in Malus sylvestris var. domestica cultivars and wild species (Dunemann et al., 1994), along with RFLPs and isozymes for tracing the parentage of ‘Braeburn’ (Gardiner et al., 1996b), and for phylogenetic studies (Zhou and Li, 2000). The following research was conducted to examine the distribution of genetic diversity in the HortResearch apple germplasm collection using RAPD markers. The objectives of the investigation were to 1) assess the level of diversity between and within different subsets of apple germplasm, 2) determine the similarity of the selections/cultivars within the collections and 3) determine if the gene pool of apples had been effectively enlarged with the germplasm obtained from other countries and continents. Materials and Methods PLANT MATERIAL. The HortResearch apple germplasm was divided into four subsets. Subset 1 consisted of old cultivars and breeding lines that are maintained in the repository and the National Cultivar Center (NCC), and subsets 2, 3 and 4 consisted sublines in the apple genetics population. The apple genetics population comprised open-pollinated (op) families as well as families derived from controlled crosses from primitive cultivars, cider apples, and wild species (Noiton et al., 1999), including wild accessions of Malus sieversii (Lebed.) and M. kirghisorum (Al.) Ponom. from Kazakhstan. The families were divided into four sublines and planted at the third leaf stage in randomized incomplete blocks of 20 single tree plots at three different sites over a period of 4 years as follows: 1991: 224 families (10,232 trees); 1992: 149 families (12,800 trees); 72 families (4,862 trees); and 1994: 86 families (3,665 trees). Sublining was used to control inbreeding and maximize, as far as possible, genetic variability and heterozygosity within the population (Noiton and Shelbourne, 1992). We crossed within sublines per generation since inbreeding is unlikely to be a serious problem for many generations. Nevertheless, we had planned to introduce new unrelated material after a few generations to circumvent inbreeding. Ideally, the families should have been grouped into sublines based on region of origin so that individuals from the same region will be confined to one subline. For example, families from countries in Western Europe should be in a different subline than families from countries in North America or Eastern Europe. But this never really happened in our own case, due in part to the fact that seeds were","Genetic diversity in 30 date palm (Phoenix dactylifera L.) cultivars in Iraq representing 24 female and six male cultivars was investigated using 22 microsatellite [simple sequence repeat (SSR)] primers. The tested SSR markers showed a high level of polymorphism. A total of 188 alleles were detected at the 22 loci ranging from three to 21 with an average of 8.54 alleles per locus. The average of heterozygosity for all cultivars was 0.503; genetic distance among cultivars varied from 0.171 to 0.938 indicating diverse relationships. The cultivar Ghanami Akhder was highly divergent from ‘Ghnami Ahmer’, whereas ‘Jamal Al-Dean’ was very closely related to ‘Qitaz’. Unweighted pair group method arithmetic average ordered date palm cultivars into two main clusters. Principal coordinate analysis exhibited the similar clusters of cultivars as in the dendrogram. Date palm (2n = 2x = 36) is considered of great socioeconomic importance in the Arabian region. The tree has been, and is still, at the center of comprehensive agricultural development. It is believed to have originated from Mesopotamia (Wrigley, 1995). The numbers of known date palm cultivars that are distributed all over the world are 5000 of which 600 are found in Iraq. Iraq is one of the largest date-producing countries in the world. Before 1991, Iraq was the largest producer of dates in the world (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, 2008) and had the largest date forest in the world (MacFarquhar, 2003). However, during the Gulf and Iran–Iraq wars, large numbers of date palm trees were destroyed. Wars and sanctions imposed on Iraq have negatively affected both the production and natural genetic diversity of the crop in Iraq and inhibited the much-needed impetus to rebuild the date palm industry. Development of suitable DNA molecular markers for this crop may allow researchers to estimate genetic diversity, which will ultimately lead to the genetic conservation of date palm. The success of particular genetic conservation or breeding programs is dependent on understanding the amount and distribution of the genetic variation already present in the genetic pool (Jubrael et al., 2005). Morphological traits have been used to describe such genetic variation in date palm cultivars (Barreveld, 1993), which are mainly related to the fruit and influenced by the environment (Askari and Al-Khalifah, 2003; Sedra et al., 1993, 1998). In addition, biochemical studies, including isozyme and activity analyses of peroxidases, have been used to characterize date palms in Morocco and Tunisia (Baaziz, 1988; Baaziz and Saaidi, 1988; Bendiab et al., 1998; Majourhat et al., 2002; Ould Salem Mohamed et al., 2001). As such, analysis does not reflect precisely that polymorphisms occurred (Al-Jibouri and Adham, 1990). DNA marker analysis in date palm is recently in the development stage. Askari and Al-Khalifah (2003) analyzed the genetic diversity among 13 different cultivars using random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) markers. Similar reports are published for North African cultivars (Hussein et al., 2002; Sedra et al., 1998). Amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) markers (Vos et al., 1995) were also been used for genetic fingerprinting and mapping for this crop. Jubrael et al., (2005) and Khierallah et al. (2011) used AFLP fingerprinting to characterize a number of Iraqi date palm cultivars. Microsatellites, also known as SSR, are ideal DNA markers for population studies and genetic mapping as a result of their abundance, high level of polymorphism, dispersion throughout diverse genomes, ease to assay by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and ease to disseminate among laboratories (Udupa and Baum, 2001). Microsatellite markers were used for investigation of genetic diversity in date palm (Billotte et al., 2004). Zehdi et al. (2004) applied these markers to characterize Tunisian cultivars, whereas Al-Ruqaishi et al. (2008) used these primers to screen and analyze the genetic diversity among clonal genotypes of Omani cultivars. Recently, many researchers in date palm-producing countries have used SSR markers to genotype cultivars. Elshibli and Korpelainen (2008) investigated genetic diversity in Sudan germplasm representing 37 female and 23 male accessions using 16 SSR primers. In Qatar, Ahmed and Al-Qaradawi (2009) used 10 primers to analyze genetic Received for publication 27 Jan. 2011. Accepted for publication 24 June 2011.

(2010) developed 1000 SSR markers in date palm, mining genome sequencing data for this vital crop. The aim of this study is intended to characterize the genotype for 30 Iraqi important date palm cultivars using SSR markers. Materials and Methods PLANT MATERIALS. Leaves were collected from 30 welldefined reference Iraqi date palm cultivars grown in date palm stations belong to the Ministry of Agriculture (Table 1). Twenty-two female cultivar samples were collected from AlMahaweel Date Palm Station, Hilla Governorate, 80 km south of Baghdad. The remaining eight cultivar samples were collected from Al-Za’afarania Date Palm Station, Baghdad (Fig. 1). Total genomic DNA was extracted from young and healthy leaves according to the procedure mentioned by Benito et al. (1993) with minor modifications. After purification, the resultant DNA was quantified on 1% agarose gel electrophoresis as described by Sambrook et al. (1989). MICROSATELLITE AMPLIFICATION. A total of 33 date palmspecific primer pairs were tested; 16 of them were developed by Billotte et al. (2004) and 17 were developed by Akkak et al. (2009) as indicated in Table 2. PCR was performed in a total mixture of 20 mL containing: 13.9 mL H2O, 50 ng of total cellular DNA (2 mL) as template, 1 mL/PCR buffer (Roche, Mannheim, Germany), 1 mL of 0.2 mM of dNTP PCR mix (Roche), 0.1 mL (0.625 U) of Taq DNA polymerase (Roche) and1 mL of 0.2 mM of each primer using forward primer end labeled (6FAM, NED, or TET). Amplifications were performed in a thermocycler (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA) under the following conditions: a denaturation step of 5 min at 95 C followed by 35 cycles of 30 s at 95 C, 1 min at 52 C and 1 min at 72 C, and a final extension step at 72 C for 7 min. At the testing stage, amplification products were separated by electrophoresis according to their molecular weight in 1.4% agarose gels and then detected by staining with ethidium bromide as described by Sambrook et al. (1989). The DNA profiles were visualized on an ultraviolet transilluminator and documented by using a gel documentation system (Alpha Innotech Imaging Station; Cell Biosciences, Santa Clara, CA). For final analyses, 2 mL of amplified DNA (diluted to 1/10) and 8 mL of (Rox) DNA standard size (Applied Biosystems) were loaded into 96-well plates. Genotyping was carried out using an automatic DNA analyzer (Model 3100; Applied Biosystems). Amplifications were performed at least twice and only reproducible products were taken into account for further data analysis. SIMPLE SEQUENCE REPEAT GENOTYPING. Electropherogram data were analyzed by using Foundation Data Collection software (Genetic Analyser Data Collection Version 2.0; Applied Biosystems). Allele size scoring was performed by Gene Mapper software (Version 3.7; Applied Biosystems). The Jaccard similarity matrix (Jaccard, 1908) was used for cluster analysis using the unweighted pair group method arithmetic average to study the genetic relationships among the cultivars. Jaccard similarity index, major allele frequency, heterozygosity, gene diversity, and polymorphism information content estimation were done using a software package (PowerMarker Version 1.31; Liu and Muse 2005). The phylogenetic diagram was drawn by PAST software [Version 1.91 (Hammer et al., 2001)] on the basis of Hamming similarity index with 100 bootstrap. Principal coordinate analysis (PCA) was performed according to Euclidean similarity index using the PAST software.","We utilized remote sensing and ground cover data to predict soil organic carbon (SOC) content across a vast geographic region. Employing a combination of machine learning and deep learning techniques, we developed a novel data fusion approach that integrated Digital Elevation Model (DEM) data, MODIS satellite imagery, WOSIS soil profile data, and CHELSA environmental data. This combined dataset, named GeoBlendMDWC, was specifically designed for SOC prediction. The primary aim of this research is to develop and evaluate a novel optimization algorithm for accurate SOC prediction by leveraging multi-source environmental data. Specifically, this study aims to (1) create an integrated dataset combining remote sensing and ground data for comprehensive SOC analysis, (2) develop a new optimization technique that enhances both machine learning and deep learning model performance, and (3) evaluate the algorithm’s efficiency and accuracy against established optimization methods like Jaya and GridSearchCV. This study focused on India, Australia, and South Africa, countries known for their significant agricultural activities. We introduced a novel optimization technique for both machine learning and deep neural networks, comparing its performance to established methods like the Jaya optimization technique and GridSearchCV. The models evaluated included XGBoost Regression, LightGBM, Gradient Boosting Regression (GBR), Random Forest Regression, Decision Tree Regression, and a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) model. Our research demonstrated that the proposed optimization algorithm consistently outperformed existing methods in terms of execution time and performance. It achieved results comparable to GridSearchCV, reaching an R2 of 90.16, which was a significant improvement over the base XGBoost model’s R2 of 79.08. In deep learning optimization, it significantly outperformed the Jaya algorithm, achieving an R2 of 61.34 compared to Jaya’s 30.04. Moreover, it was 20–30 times faster than GridSearchCV. Given its speed and accuracy, this algorithm can be applied to real-time data processing in remote sensing satellites. This advanced methodology will greatly benefit the agriculture and farming sectors by providing precise SOC predictions.","Fruit-tree crops generate food and income for local households and contribute to South Africa’s gross domestic product. Timely and accurate phenotyping of fruit-tree crops is essential for innovating and achieving precision agriculture in the horticulture industry. Traditional methods for fruit-tree crop classification are time-consuming, costly, and often impossible to use for mapping heterogeneous horticulture systems. The application of remote sensing in smallholder agricultural landscapes is more promising. However, intercropping systems coupled with the presence of dispersed small agricultural fields that are characterized by common and uncommon crop types result in imbalanced samples, which may limit conventionally applied classification methods for phenotyping. This study assessed the influence of balanced and imbalanced multi-class distribution and data-sampling techniques on fruit-tree crop detection accuracy. Seven data samples were used as input to adaptive boosting (AdaBoost), gradient boosting (GB), random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and eXtreme gradient boost (XGBoost) machine learning algorithms. A pixel-based approach was applied using Sentinel-2 (S2). The SVM algorithm produced the highest classification accuracy of 71%, compared with AdaBoost (67%), RF (65%), XGBoost (63%), and GB (62%), respectively. Individually, the majority of the crop types were classified with an F1 score of between 60% and 100%. In addition, the study assessed the effect of size and ratio of class imbalance in the training datasets on algorithms’ sensitiveness and stability. The results show that the highest classification accuracy of 71% could be achieved from an imbalanced training dataset containing only 60% of the original dataset. The results also showed that S2 data could be successfully used to map fruit-tree crops and provide valuable information for subtropical crop management and precision agriculture in heterogeneous horticultural landscapes.","Crop area extent estimates and crop type maps provide crucial information for agricultural monitoring and management. Remote sensing imagery in general and, more specifically, high temporal and high spatial resolution data as the ones which will be available with upcoming systems, such as Sentinel-2, constitute a major asset for this kind of application. The goal of this paper is to assess to what extent state-of-the-art supervised classification methods can be applied to high resolution multi-temporal optical imagery to produce accurate crop type maps at the global scale. Five concurrent strategies for automatic crop type map production have been selected and benchmarked using SPOT4 (Take5) and Landsat 8 data over 12 test sites spread all over the globe (four in Europe, four in Africa, two in America and two in Asia). This variety of tests sites allows one to draw conclusions applicable to a wide variety of landscapes and crop systems. The results show that a random forest classifier operating on linearly temporally gap-filled images can achieve overall accuracies above 80% for most sites. Only two sites showed low performances: Madagascar due to the presence of fields smaller than the pixel size and Burkina Faso due to a mix of trees and crops in the fields. The approach is based on supervised machine learning techniques, which need in situ data collection for the training step, but the map production is fully automatic.","Soil moisture (SM) is a fundamental constituent of the terrestrial environment and the hydrological cycle. Owing to its significant influence on catchment hydrological responses, it can be utilized as an indicator of floods and droughts to aid early warning systems. This study aimed to develop a field‐scale method to estimate SM using parametric and machine learning‐based methods to compare whether advanced artificial intelligence methods can give similar results as traditional methods. Considering this, monthly observed SM data (from the top 10 cm), environmental covariates, and remotely sensed data from March 2019 to July 2021 for the Cathedral Peak Research Catchments VI and IX in South Africa were obtained. From the 241 observations obtained across 12 sites, 160 (∼66%) were used for model training, while the remaining 81 (∼34%) were used for model testing. Employing 10‐fold cross‐validation, the individual machine learning models (viz., support vector machine [SVM], random forest (RF), k‐nearest neighbor, classification and regression trees [Rpart], and generalized linear model) displayed a satisfactory performance (R2 = 0.52–0.79; root mean square error = 3.79–5.80). In the validation phase, the RF model displayed a superior performance, followed by the SVM. Subsequent SM estimation using the hybrid model produced satisfactory results in training (R2 = 0.90) and testing (R2 = 0.45). The results obtained from this study can aid in predicting SM variations in catchments with limited monitoring. Furthermore, this model can be applied in drought monitoring, forecasting, and informing agricultural management practices.","The efficacy of the Senegal prickly-ash Zanthoxylum zanthoxyloides (Lam.) roots and the African locust bean tree Parkia biglobosa (Jacq.) pod back was study for their efficacy in the control of okra pest, Podagrica spp. The study was carried out in the laboratory and on the field in the farming season of 2018. Z. zanthoxyloides roots were obtained from Jima-Doko forest and P. biglibosa fruit back from Takunpara. Both plant materials were air-dried under shade for 120 hours. Both plant parts were pounded separately in wooden mortar with the aid of wooden pestle until the materials turns to fine particles. Determined weight of 100, 150, 200, 250, and 300 grams were taken for each plant materials and soaked in water for 24 hours and stirred at intervals of an hour. The mixture were then sieved with a muslin cloth and filtered with Whatman filter paper to eliminate all finest particles of varying sizes. These concentrations were applied individually on 10 adults of Podagrica spp. in the laboratory. It was observed that the concentration of 200 – 300g performed better for both plant materials in the control of okra flea beetle. These resulted to the death of above 50% of the insect within 2 hours. These significant laboratory trials were then formulated and taken to the field. Both plant materials acted as anti-feedants and repellants against Podagrica spp. It was also revealed that Z. zanthoxyloides performed significantly (p<0.05) better than the P. biglibosa. Furthermore, short interval applications (<or=3days) of these plant materials could be a good  replacement for synthetic chemicals, hence bio-pesticides that could be adopted for organic agriculture.","Effective drought management requires precise measurement, but this is challenging due to the variety of drought indices and indicators, each with unique methods and specific uses, and limited ground data availability. This study utilizes remote sensing data from 2001 to 2020 to compute drought indices categorized as meteorological, agricultural, and hydrological. A Gaussian kernel convolves these indices into a denoised, multi-band composite image. Further refinement with a Gaussian kernel enhances a single drought index from each category: Reconnaissance Drought Index (RDI), Soil Moisture Agricultural Drought Index (SMADI), and Streamflow Drought Index (SDI). The enhanced index, encompassing all bands, serves as a predictor for classification and regression tree (CART), support vector machine (SVM), and random forest (RF) machine learning models, further improving the three indices. CART demonstrated the highest accuracy and error minimization across all drought categories, with root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) values between 0 and 0.4. RF ranked second, while SVM, though less reliable, achieved values below 0.7. The results show persistent drought in the Sahel, North Africa, and southwestern Africa, with meteorological drought affecting 30% of Africa, agricultural drought affecting 22%, and hydrological drought affecting 21%.","Unfettered agricultural activities have severely degraded vast areas of grasslands over the last decade. To rehabilitate and restore the productivity in affected grasslands, rangeland management practices still institute vast nitrogen-based fertilization regimes. However, excessive fertilization can often have damaging environmental effects. Over-fertilization can lead to nitrogen saturation. Although early indicators of nitrogen saturation have been documented, research detailing the near-real-time nitrogen saturation status of grasslands is required to better facilitate management protocols and optimize biomass production within degraded grasslands. Hence, the aim of this study was to discriminate nitrogen-saturated tropical grasses grown under a diverse fertilization treatment trial, using Worldview-3 satellite imagery and decision tree techniques. To accomplish this, nitrogen-saturated plots were first identified through specific physiological-based criteria. Thereafter, Worldview-3 satellite imagery (400–1040 nm) and decision tree techniques were applied to discriminate between nitrogen-saturated and -unsaturated grassland plots. The results showed net nitrate (NO3−-N) concentrations and net pH levels to be significantly different (α = 0.05) between saturated and non-saturated plots. Moreover, the random forest model (overall accuracy of 91%) demonstrated a greater ability to classify saturated plots as opposed to the classification and regression tree method (overall accuracy of 79%). The most important variables for classifying saturated plots were identified as: the Red-Edge (705–745 nm), Coastal (400–450 nm), Near-Infrared 3 (838–950 nm), Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI) and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index 3 (NDVI3). These results provide a framework to assist rangeland managers in identifying grasslands within the initial stages of nitrogen saturation. This will enable fertilization treatments to be adjusted in near-real-time according to ecosystem demand and thereby maintain the health and longevity of Southern African grasslands.","Woody biomass production is a critical indicator in evaluation of land use management and the dynamics of the global carbon cycle (sequestration/emission) in terrestrial ecosystems. The objective of the present study was to develop, through a case study in Sudan, an operational multiscale remote-sensing-based methodology for large-scale estimation of woody biomass in tropical savannahs. Woody biomass estimation models obtained by different authors from destructive field measurements in different tropical savannah ecosystems were expressed as functions of tree canopy cover (CC). The field-measured CC data were used for developing regression equations with atmospherically corrected and reflectance-based vegetation indices derived from Landsat ETM+ (Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus) imagery. Among a set of vegetation indices, the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) provided the best correlation with CC (R2 = 0.91) and was hence selected for woodland woody biomass estimation. After validation of the CC-NDVI model and its applicability to Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data, time-series MODIS NDVI data (MOD13Q1) were used to partition the woody component from the herbaceous component for sparse woodlands, woodlands and forests defined by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations Land Cover Map. Following the weighting of the estimation models based on the dominant woody species in each vegetation community, NDVI-based woody biomass models were applied according to their weighted ratios to the decomposed summer and autumn woody NDVI images in all vegetation communities in the whole of Sudan taking the year 2007, for example. The results were found to be in good agreement with those from other authors obtained by either field measurements or other remote sensing methods using MODIS and lidar data. It is concluded that the proposed approach is operational and can be applied for a reliable large-scale assessment of woody biomass at a ground resolution of 250 m in tropical savannah woodlands of any month or season.",21.1140775422983,1,Unlabeled
