Because of these changes, Aspergillus parasiticus was isolated, for the first time, from maize grain in Serbia (Nikolic et al, 2018). The presence of black powdery mycelia on maize ears indicated occurrence of species of the genus Aspergillus section Nigri, which led to the need for detailed identification of these fungi. Disease incidence ranged from 10 and 15% in August 2013. Maize ears with black powdery symptoms were collected from field in Zemun Polje, Serbia. Symptomatic kernels were surface sterilized with 1% sodium hypochlorite solution for 3 min, rinsed three times with sterilized water, then incubated at 25°C in the dark for 7 days on potato dextrose agar (PDA). Twenty isolates were identified as genus Aspergillus section Nigri. Monospore cultures formed black cottony colonies with a yellowish border on PDA. The average colony diameter was 50 mm. In order to reliably identify, isolates were transferred to Malt Extract agar (MEA) and Czapek Yeast Autolysate agar (CYA) (Samson et al, 2014). On CYA fungal colonies consisted of a white mycelium, covered by a layer of black conidiophores. On MEA fungal colonies were dense, black, with yellowish border. The reverse side was colorless to pale yellow, with a yellow ring in the middle. The average size of conidia was 4.3 µm. The conidia were globose to sub-globose, smooth to roughened, which coincides with previous research (Silva et al, 2020). Given that the fungi Aspergillus niger and Aspergillus welwitschiae are morphologically indistinguishable (Susca et al, 2016), species level identification was completed by analysis of a partial sequence of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region (ITS1/ITS4 primers) and calmodulin gene (CMD5/CMD6 primers) (Samson et al., 2014). The sequences were compared with the sequences of A. welwitschiae strains registered in the GenBank database based on nucleotide similarity, and results showed 99,64 and 100% similarity with ITS (OL711714) and calmodulin (KX894585), respectively. The sequence was deposited in GenBank with accession numbers OQ456471 (ITS) and OQ426518 (calmodulin). We also confirmed the presence of this species with specific primers (AWEL1/AWEL2) designed by Susca et al. 2020. Pathogenicity test was performed in Zemun Polje on the same maize hybrid from which the fungal species was isolated. Using artificial inoculations by the injecting conidial suspension into the silk channel, three days after 50% of plants reached the silking stage. Twenty ears were inoculated with each isolate, in four replicates (Reid et al, 1996). Inoculum was prepared from 7-day-old colonies on PDA, and 2 ml of a conidial suspension (1×106 spores/ml) was used. Control plants were inoculated with sterile water. All inoculated ears showed symptoms, similar to those from field infections. Control ears were symptomless. The fungus was reisolated and was morphologically identical to the original isolates, thus completing Koch's postulates. Based on molecular, morphological and pathogenic properties, the isolates were identified as A. welwitschiae. This is the first report of A. welwitschiae as the causal agent of black maize ear rot not only in Serbia, but also in the other countries of the Western Balkans. Given that the fungus A. welwitschiae synthesizes both ochratoxin A (OTA) (Battilani et al, 2006) and fumonisin (FB) (Frisvad et al, 2011), further studies should be focused on assessment its aggressiveness and toxicological profile.","Potato dextrose and malt extract agar were found to be suitable for culturing different isolates of Pyricularia oryzae. Colonies of P. oryzae appeared as white on oat meal, rice polish and malt extract agar, grey on potato dextrose agar and whitish grey on rice agar. Spore induction was hastened on maize stem pieces than on rice and Panicum repens. Spore density on maize was 3420/ml of water as against 500/ml on P. repens. When spores of 11 isolates of P. oryzae were compared, conidia of the isolate from Pennisetum purpureum were significantly bigger than the other isolates. The spores of rice isolates from Erode and Gopichettipalayam were significantly smaller in length and width.Fingerprinting of 11 isolates of P. oryzae by retrotransposon - microsatellite amplified polymorphism (REMAP) showed a high level of variability and polymorphism among them. Phylogenetic analysis using REMAP markers grouped out one rice isolate from others. Two isolates of Tirunelveli region were grouped together like Erode and Gopichettipalayam isolates. Isolates causing leaf and neck blast showed 52.9% similarity. Isolates from Coimbatore and Gudalore were 32.7% similar; likewise two non-rice host isolates were grouped together with 27.6% similarity.   Key words: Variability, culture media, rice blast, Pyricularia oryzae, retrotransposon, microsatellite.","The research was conducted to investigate fungal species associated with common tropical weeds in Choba, Rivers State of Southern Nigeria. Weed samples were collected from plots previously cropped with maize, soybean, cassava, aerial yam and plantain at the University of Port Harcourt, Teaching and Research Farm, Choba, Nigeria. The samples were chopped into pieces (5 mm), sterilized in 2% of sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) solution for 2 mins, rinsed in three changes of sterile distilled water andthereafter placed on potato dextrose agar (PDA) and incubated at 28 ± 2°C in complete darkness for 5 days. Repeated sub-culturing was done to get pure cultures. These were identified microscopically and morphologically in line with standard techniques. A total of thirty-five weeds species, comprising of twenty-seven broadleaves, five grasses and three sedges were collected from the plots. Three fungal pathogens namely; Aspergillus spp, Fusarium sp, Penicillium sp known to produce toxins (aflatoxin, fumonisin and patulin, respectively), were isolated from the weed samples. Common weeds such as Cyperus esculentus, Phyllanthus amarus var niruri and Panicum maximum were all associated with the commonly isolated fungal pathogens. These weeds were well distributed across plots and therefore could serve as alternate host in the field and also pose serious risk on crop production and quality.","Eighty three local isolates of fungi were isolated from different resources (Peanuts , maize, rice, wheat, bread , domestic cheese of sheep, Milk local Cream, Iranian cream, Roquefort cheese and soil). These isolates were purified and identified, it include 14 isolates of Aspergillus flavus, 13 Aspergillus niger,8 Aspergillus terreus,3Aspergillus parasaticus,3Alternaria spp.,15Penicilliumspp.,7Fusarium spp.,5 Trichoderma spp., 11 Rhizopus spp. and 7Mucor spp. The ability of isolates for producing aflatoxin were tested, the toxic isolates(Aspergillus flavus,Aspergillus terreus ,and Aspergillus parasaticus) were removed.Aspergillus niger which was isolated from maize was choosing as the best lipoxygenase producer after Primary and secondary screening. The growth of the selected isolate colonies had the largest proportion than the Colonies of Penicillium sp. and Trichoderma sp..all so the same isolate had high enzymatic activity 801.4units/ml, while Penicillium sp. and Trichoderma sp. had (559.2 and 120) units/ml respectively. INTRODUCTION Filamentous fungi are eukaryotes that digest food extremely and absorb nutrients directly through its sell wall. Most of fungi reproduce by spores and have a body ( thallus) composed of microscopic tubular cells called hyphae. Aspergillus niger is one of the filamentous fungus with black colonies so that it usually known as black mold. It exist in all over the world in extend, although it causes the food Bas.J.Vet.Res.Vol.16, No.1, 2017.

A.niger is one of the mold using inbio-technology processing because it is safe in food , while some of A.niger strains may be distinguish itself via production of mycotoxins fungal. Lipoxy genase (LOX) (linoleate: oxygen oxido reductase; EC:1.13.11.12) discovered first time in 1928 by Haas and Bohn when they observe the loss of yellow color from wheat flour sample after adding small amount of soybean flour. Lipoxy genase is a group of oxidized enzyme including nonhemiiron atom in its effective atom as well as it is stimulates to molecular of oxygen. These enzymes are link the oxygen with unsaturated fatty acid such as arachidonic and linolenic and linoleic to produced peroxides and hydroperoxides, these free radicals are able to oxidase the sulpha hydreal groups of wheat flour proteins and form bi-sulphide bonds which strengthen the gluten, they found that the LOX extracted from soybeans for bleaching and increase the stability of wheat flour and improvement the rheological properties. LOX plays an important role in developing the flavor compounds such as the carbonate and alcohol compounds through produced of different type of peroxides isomers, which contain one of flavor compounds. LOX has special importance to produce aromatic compounds because it gives unique properties because it range of hydroperoxide isomers .LOX it exist widely in plant and animal kingdom and Micro-organisms. LOX differs in substrate so essential fatty acids exist naturally such as linoleic acid (18: 2) and acid linolenic (18: 3) and arachidonic acid works as enzymes substrate . Due to the lack of studies in LOX production from Micro-organisms in Iraq and because of the importance of this enzyme, and its role in food products, So this study aims to obtain some local fungal isolates for LOX production.

There is a great variation between various genera as to their ability to produce a specific enzyme for the production of particular enzymes varies with the particular medium and pH. Place and Duration of Study: The study was conducted at the Department of Microbiology Laboratory, Abubakar Tafawa Balewa University, ATBU, Bauchi Nigeria, from November, 2020 to October, 2021. Aim: This study was aimed to isolates fungi from disposed maize cobs and evaluates its potentials to produce amylase. Methods: Twelve samples each was collected from three different areas; market place, farmland and residential areas in Bauchi metropolis, (a total of 36 samples in all) using precise aseptic techniques. Each sample was collected using clean polythene bag, transported to the lab and aseptically blended. One gram of each sample was aseptically weighed and placed in a test tube containing sterile water; it was then allowed to stand for 30 minutes. One ml of the stock solution was serially diluted and 10ml dilution of each sample was plated on Potato Dextrose Agar (PDA) media. The plate was incubated at 25°C within a period of three, five and seven days during which they were monitored and examined, to isolate the required fungi species. The isolates were tested for amylolytic activity using 1% iodine and screen for amylase production by pre-treatment and solid state fermentation, then α-amylase activity finally determined. Results: Amylase-producing fungi were isolated from maize cobs collected from residence, market and farm areas in Bauchi metropolis. The ability of ten (10) fungal isolates recovered, (Mucor racemosus, Aspergillus niger Penicillium chrysogenum, Rhizopus oryzae, Microsporum sp, Trichoderma sp, Nocardia sp, Monilla sp, Fusarium sp and Chaetomum sp) to degrade starch was determined. Three (3) of the fungal isolates Aspergillus niger Penicillium chrysogenum, Rhizopus oryzae, had the highest frequency of (20%) each. Four (4) of the fungal isolates (Mucor racemosus, Aspergillus niger, Penicillium chrysogenum and Rhizopus oryzae) showed zone of clearance on starch agar medium, the fungi isolates were selected and subjected to various temperatures, incubation time and pH ranges for amylase production. The results showed that Penicillium chrysogenum and Rhizopus oryzae have maximum amylase activity at temperature 35°C, incubation time 96hrs (4days), pH 5.5 and temperature 30°C,incubation time 96hrs(4days) and pH 5.0 respectively. Penicillium chrysogenum produced 46.3μ/ml, and Rhizopus oryzae, produced 30.8μ/ml of amylase. Conclusion: The results of this work proved Penicillium chrysogenum to be the best producer of amylase compared to Rhizopus oryzae. Isolation of amylase producing fungi from maize cobs from residence, market and farm areas will help in the bioremediation of environment, which could have caused environmental pollution. It is recommended that Penicillium chrysogenum and Rhizopus oryzae, are suitable fungi for amylase production. While Maize cobs can be used as substrate for commercial enzymes production.","Originality-Significance statement Although the reach of large-scale comparative studies has spread exponentially over the years, the phytopathogenic Dickeya group remains overlooked. In this work, we sequence the complete genome of Dickeya aquatica type strain, a species isolated from water that was first assumed to be non-phytopathogenic. We show that the proteome of D. aquatica contains a wide number of proteins involved in Dickeya virulence, including plant cell wall degrading enzymes, suggesting that this species could be in fact pathogenic. Using experimental approaches, we confirm this prediction and uncover the particular affinity of D. aquatica for acidic fruits. In-depth phylogenomic analyses reveal that Dickeya species display a great degree of genetic plasticity in the pathogenicity determinants, explaining how this bacterial group was able to colonize a wide variety of plants growing in different climates. These observations greatly advance our understanding of how bacteria adapt to new ecological niches. Summary Dickeya is a genus of phytopathogenic enterobacterales causing soft rot in a variety of plants (e.g. potato, chicory, maize). Among the species affiliated to this genus, Dickeya aquatica, described in 2014, remained particularly mysterious because it had no known host. Furthermore, while D. aquatica was proposed to represent a deep-branching species among Dickeya genus, its precise phylogenetic position remained elusive. Here, we report the complete genome sequence of the D. aquatica type strain 174/2. We demonstrate the affinity of D. aquaticaT for acidic fruits such as tomato and cucumber, and show that exposure of this bacterium to acidic pH induces twitching motility. An in-depth phylogenomic analysis of all available Dickeya proteomes pinpoints D. aquatica as the second deepest branching lineage within this genus and reclassifies two lineages that likely correspond to new genomospecies (gs.): Dickeya gs. poaceaephila (Dickeya sp NCPPB 569) and Dickeya gs. undicola (Dickeya sp 2B12), together with a new putative genus, tentatively named Prodigiosinella. Finally, from comparative analyses of Dickeya proteomes we infer the complex evolutionary history of this genus, paving the way to study the adaptive patterns and processes of Dickeya to different environmental niches and hosts. In particular, we hypothetize that the lack of xylanases and xylose degradation pathways in D. aquatica could reflects adaptation to aquatic charophyte hosts which, in contrast to land plants, do not contain xyloglucans.","The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect on the physiological performance of maize seeds (Zea mays L.) of micro-priming with Bacillus subtilis associated with techniques of water restriction and seed-coating. The micro-priming of the seeds, without any additional techniques, was carried out using a commercial product, Rhizoliptus ® (Bacillus subtilis). Water restriction was carried out using a PDA medium (Potato - Dextrose - Agar) with mannitol (-0.7 MPa), upon which the culture was grown for 48hours. One hundred sterilized corn seeds were placed in each dish. Once root protrusion occurred in one seed, the rest were removed and kept in a laboratory environment for 48 hours. The coating was carried out by the addition of Seed Polymer Color HE (50 ml kg -1 ) to the priming mixture containing theBacillus subtilis. The seeds were kept for 48 hours in a laboratory environment. A treatment which associated seed coating and water restriction was used on the micro-primed seeds, together with a control treatment without the addition of Bacillus subtilis. The Bacillus subtilis has no effect on the health of the seeds it; does however contribute to the growth and development of the maize seedlings, being influenced by the micro- priming technique used. The use of water restriction associated with seed coating provides better results when micro-priming with Bacillus subtilis.","Abstract The key factor of powerful scientific studies is experiment. This research studied how to use cereals and waste from it to achieve value. Corn or maize is the most widely grown grain crop. It is very practical. It is used as staple food, major source of cooking oil and grown to feed for livestock. Starch from maize can be made into syrups plastics, fabrics, adhesives, and many other chemical products and also fermented and distilled to produce alcohol. This research aims to compare pigment synthetic of Neurospora sp., widely used as a model organism in genetics research, when use corn, dry corncob and potato dextrose agar as culture medium. After fully grow up, extracted mycelium pigment with 95% ethyl alcohol. Then measure the absorbance of the pigment by spectrophotometer at wavelength 450.5 nanometer. The results showed that the best growth of Neurospora cultured on dry corncob was sample which added water (for moisture) 90% w/w. While the best growth of Neurospora cultured on corn was sample which added water only 15% w/w. When compare the intensity of mycelium pigment, it was found that corncob is the best medium for pigment synthetic of Neurospor a. Absorbance of pigment extract from mycelium culture on corncob was 0.64(diluted 5X). As the absorbance of pigment extract from mycelium culture on corn and PDA were only 0.34(diluted 5X) and 0.35(diluted 2X).","Aims: It is aimed to identify the bacterial pathogen that causes water soaking, browning, softening, rotting, unpleasant odour and collapses on stalks of maize plants growing in Adana and Osmaniye provinces in 2021 and 2022.Methods and Results: Plants showing bacterial stalk rot disease symptoms were collected from maize fields in Adana and Osmaniye provinces and 29 bacterial strains were obtained in the study. Totally 22 of the obtained strains caused soft rot on potato slices in pectolytic activity tests and showed positive results in pathogenicity tests on maize seedlings. Morphological, physiological and biochemical tests, MALDI-TOF and PCR tests were used to identify the strains and the strains were compatible with Dickeya zeae. The strains showed a high match with the CFBP-2052 coded Dickeya zeae isolate found in the MALDI TOF library with 2.264; 2.332; 2.339; 2.364 and 2.365 score values. In the PCR test using the ADE1/ADE2 primer pair, all of our strains were identified as Dickeya zeae by forming bands of 420 bp.Conclusions: In the study, the stalk rot disease caused by Dickeya zeae was observed for the first time in maize fields in Adana and Osmaniye provinces. Therefore, it is necessary to take precautions with cultural measures against the disease, which has no chemical control. So, the use of healthy and certified seeds, drip irrigation instead of wild or sprinkler irrigation, removal of all diseased plant residues from the fields, and increasing the microbial activity of the soil by beneficial microorganisms are important strategies in the management of the disease.Significance and Impact of the Study: Dickeya zeae causal agent of bacterial stalk rot disease of maize has been isolated and identified from diseased plants such as symptoms of water-soak appearance, browning, softening, rotting, unpleasant odour and collapse of the stalks in Adana and Osmaniye provinces.","The present study was undertaken to assess the effect of different land uses on physical properties in a Mollisol. The study area was located at Norman E. Borlaug Crop Research Centre, G. B. Pant University of Agriculture and Technology, Pantnagar, which lies at 290 N latitude, 790 3’ E longitude and 243.84 m above the mean sea level altitude. The land use systems selected for study were S1 (rice – potato – okra), S2 (rice – pea (vegetable) – maize), S3 (sorghum multicut (fodder) – yellow sarson – black gram), S4 (rice – wheat – green gram), S5 (rice – berseem + oat + mustard (fodder) – maize + cowpea (fodder)), S6 (guava + lemon), S7 (poplar + turmeric), S8 (eucalyptus + turmeric), S9 (fallow (uncultivated land)). The soil sample collected from D1 (0-15 cm depth), D2 (15-30 cm depth), D3 (30-45 cm depth) and D4 (45-60 cm depth) for analysed soil physical properties (soil colour, soil texture, bulk density, particle density, porosity and water holding capacity). Among the different land use systems S9 treatment obtained significantly high value. The highest value of pH, EC, bulk density and water holding capacity were reported with D4 depth (7.59), with D1 depth (0.289 dSm-1), with D4 depth (1.47 g cm-3) and with D1 depth (55.47%), respectively. While the lowest value was observed with D1 depth (7.51), with D4 depth (0.244 dSm-1), with D1 depth (1.38 g cm-3) and with D4 depth (50.15%), respectively. Results indicated that soil under agroforestry based systems was found superior with respect to soil physical environment followed by field crops, horticultural crops and the uncultivated land.",14.4507131497922

Finding water-saving cropping systems without compromising food security is a more likely solution. In this study, six alternative cropping systems’ water conservation and food supply capacity were compared simultaneously. A combined water footprint method was applied to analyze the cropping systems’ water consumption. The winter wheat–summer maize system had the largest water consumption (16,585 m3/ha on average), followed by the potato/spring maize, spinach–spring maize, rye–spring maize, vetch–spring maize, pea/spring maize, soybean||spring maize and mono-spring maize cropping systems. For the groundwater, the spinach–spring maize, pea/spring maize, soybean||spring maize systems showed a higher degree of synchronization between crop growth period and rainfall, which could reduce use of groundwater by 36.8%, 54.4% and 57.6%, respectively. For food supply capacity, the values for spinach–spring maize, pea/spring maize, soybean||spring maize systems were 73.0%, 60.8% and 48.4% of winter wheat–summer maize, respectively, but they showed a better feeding efficiency than the winter wheat–summer maize system. On the whole, spinach–spring maize may be a good option to prevent further decline in groundwater level and to ensure food security in a sustainable way.","This paper describes impact analyses of various soil water flow regimes on grass, maize and potato yields in the Dutch delta, with a focus on upward soil water flows capillary rise and recirculation towards the rootzone. Flow regimes are characterised by soil composition and groundwater depth and derived from a national soil database. The intermittent occurrence of upward flow and its influence on crop growth are simulated with the combined SWAP-WOFOST model using various boundary conditions. Case studies and model experiments are used to illustrate impact of upward flow on yield and crop growth. This impact is clearly present in situations with relatively shallow groundwater levels (85 % of the Netherlands), where capillary rise is the main flow source; but also in free-draining situations the impact of upward flow is considerable. In the latter case recirculated percolation water is the flow source. To make this impact explicit we implemented a synthetic modelling option that stops upward flow from reaching the root zone, without inhibiting percolation. Such a hypothetically moisture-stressed situation compared to a natural one in the presence of shallow groundwater shows mean yield reductions for grassland, maize and potatoes of respectively 25, 4 and 15 % or respectively about 3.2, 0.5 and 1.6 ton dry matter per ha. About half of the withheld water behind these yield effects comes from recirculated percolation water as occurs in free drainage conditions and the other half comes from increased upward capillary rise. Soil water and crop growth modelling should consider both capillary rise from groundwater and recirculation of percolation water as this improves the accuracy of yield simulations. This also improves the accuracy of the simulated groundwater recharge: neglecting these processes causes overestimates of 17 % for grassland and 46 % for potatoes, or 70 and 34 mm a −1 , respectively.","Abstract. Upward soil water flow is a vital supply of water to crops. The purpose of this study is to determine if upward flow and recirculated percolation water can be quantified separately, and to determine the contribution of capillary rise and recirculated water to crop yield and groundwater recharge. Therefore, we performed impact analyses of various soil water flow regimes on grass, maize and potato yields in the Dutch delta. Flow regimes are characterized by soil composition and groundwater depth and derived from a national soil database. The intermittent occurrence of upward flow and its influence on crop growth are simulated with the combined SWAP-WOFOST model using various boundary conditions. Case studies and model experiments are used to illustrate the impact of upward flow on yield and crop growth. This impact is clearly present in situations with relatively shallow groundwater levels (85 % of the Netherlands), where capillary rise is a well-known source of upward flow; but also in free-draining situations the impact of upward flow is considerable. In the latter case recirculated percolation water is the flow source. To make this impact explicit we implemented a synthetic modelling option that stops upward flow from reaching the root zone, without inhibiting percolation. Such a hypothetically moisture-stressed situation compared to a natural one in the presence of shallow groundwater shows mean yield reductions for grassland, maize and potatoes of respectively 26, 3 and 14 % or respectively about 3.7, 0.3 and 1.5 t dry matter per hectare. About half of the withheld water behind these yield effects comes from recirculated percolation water as occurs in free-drainage conditions and the other half comes from increased upward capillary rise. Soil water and crop growth modelling should consider both capillary rise from groundwater and recirculation of percolation water as this improves the accuracy of yield simulations. This also improves the accuracy of the simulated groundwater recharge: neglecting these processes causes overestimates of 17 % for grassland and 46 % for potatoes, or 63 and 34 mm yr−1, respectively.","A field experiment was conducted during three seasons of 2019-20 at RPCAU, Pusa to evaluate the Effect of Diversification on System Productivity and Profitability under North Bihar Condition. Treatment comprised cropping systems in main plots: C1 - Rice - Wheat - Fallow, C2 - Rice - Wheat - Green Gram, C3 - Rice - Maize - Dhaincha, C4 - Rice - Maize + Potato - Dhaincha, C5 - Rice - Maize + Green Pea - Dhaincha and moisture regimes in sub plots with 3 days disappearance of ponded water in kharif season, three levels of IW/CPE ratio in rabi season I1: IW/CPE = 0.6, I2: IW/CPE = 0.8, I3: IW/CPE = 1.0 and one or two irrigation in zaid season if required. Maximum rice grain yield (5.36 t/ha) was observed at C5 cropping system which was significantly superior to C1 and at par with C2, C3 and C4 cropping system. Maximum Production Efficiency (92.13 kg/ha/day) and Profitability (1156.49 ₹/ha/day) was found at C4 cropping system which was significantly superior to   C1, C2, C3 and C5 Cropping system. In sub plots maximum Production Efficiency (56.72 kg/ha/day), and Profitability (685.88 ₹/ha/day) was found at I3 which was significantly superior to I2 and I1. Relative Production efficiency was found to be maximum in C4 (204.36 %) and I3 (13.58 %) cropping system.","Abstract. This paper describes analyses of different soil water flow regimes on growth and yields of grass, maize and potato crops in the Dutch delta, with a focus on the role of capillary rise. Different flow regimes are characterised by differences in soil composition and structure are derived from a national soil database. Capillary rise and its influence on crop growth and resulting yields is simulated using Swap-Wofost with different boundary conditions. Case studies and model experiments are used to illustrate the impact of capillary rise. This impact is clearly present in situations where a groundwater level is present (85 % of NL) but also in other situations the impact of capillary rise on crop growth and production is considerable. When one compares situations with average groundwater levels with free drainage conditions without capillary rise yield-reductions of grassland, maize and potatoes are respectively 25, 4 and 15 % or respectively about 3.2, 0.5 and 1.6 ton dry Matter per ha. Neglecting capillary rise also has impact on the downward leaching water flux, the groundwater recharge. Impact can be considerable; for grassland and potatoes the reduction is 17 and 46 % or 64 and 34 mm. Modelling of soil water flow should consider capillary rise of soil water which will results in improved yield and downward leaching simulations.","Plastic film mulching has been widely used to improve crop yield and water use efficiency, although the effects of plastic film mulching on water, heat, nitrogen dynamics, and crop growth are rarely presented comprehensively. This study investigated a large number of studies in film mulching fields from the past 10 years (mostly from 2019 to 2023) and summarized the impact of plastic film mulching, progress in modeling with film mulching, and future research directions. The effects of plastic film mulching were intricate and were influenced by film mulching methods, irrigation systems, crop types, crop growth stages, etc. Overall, plastic film mulching showed a positive effect on improving soil water, temperature, and nitrogen status, enhancing crop transpiration and photosynthetic rates, and promoting crop growth and yield, although film mulching may have negative effects, such as increasing rainfall interception, blocking water entering the soil, and reducing net radiation income. The crop yield and water use efficiency could increase by 39.9–84.7% and 45.3–106.4% under various film mulching methods. Coupled models of soil water and heat transport and crop growth under plastic film mulching conditions have been established by considering the effects of plastic film mulching on the upper boundary conditions of soil water and heat, energy budget and distribution processes, and the exchange of latent and sensible heat between soil and atmosphere. The models have good applicability in film mulched farmland of maize, rice, and potato for different regions of China. Further development is needed for soil water, heat, nitrogen migration, and crop growth models under different plastic film mulching methods, and the acquisition of soil and crop indicators under plastic film mulching conditions based on big data support. The study will provide reference for the subsequent development and innovation of plastic film mulching technology.","Exploring crop yield stability and the relationship between the water–fertilizer effect and annual precipitation type in a broomcorn millet–potato–spring corn rotation system under long-term fertilization on chestnut cinnamon soil in loess tableland can provide a scientific basis for rational fertilization in the northwest Shanxi region in years with different precipitation. This study was based on a 33-year long-term fertilizer experiment, using four fertilizer treatments: no fertilizer as control (CT), single fertilizer nitrogen (N), single organic fertilizer (M), and nitrogen fertilizer with organic fertilizer (NM). The results showed that broomcorn millet and maize had the highest yield in wet years, while potatoes had the highest yield in normal years and the yield under NM treatment was the highest. The sustainable yield index (SYI) values for potato and maize were higher than the SYI for the broomcorn millet during years with different precipitation and the SYI for the NM treatment was the highest. The water use efficiency of NM treatment was the highest. The yield of broomcorn millet and maize was affected by nitrogen fertilizer, organic fertilizer, and precipitation during the growth period, while the potato yield was mainly affected by nitrogen fertilizer and organic fertilizer. Therefore, the rotation of potato–maize and the rational allocation of organic and inorganic fertilizer (NM) is the best planting system in this region.","In the North China Plain, groundwater tables have been dropping at unsustainable rates of 1 m per year due to irrigation of a double cropping system of winter wheat and summer maize. To reverse the trend, we examined whether alternative crop rotations could save water. Moisture contents were measured weekly at 20 cm intervals in the top 180 cm of soil as part of a 12-year field experiment with four crop rotations: sweet potato→ cotton→ sweet potato→ winter wheat-summer maize (SpCSpWS, 4-year cycle); peanuts → winter wheat-summer maize (PWS, 2-year cycle); ryegrass–cotton→ peanuts→ winter wheat-summer maize (RCPWS, 3-year cycle); and winter wheat-summer maize (WS, each year). We found that, compared to WS, the SpCSpWS annual evapotranspiration was 28% lower, PWS was 19% lower and RCPWS was 14% lower. The yield per unit of water evaporated improved for wheat within any alternative rotation compared to WS, increasing up to 19%. Average soil moisture contents at the sowing date of wheat in the SpCSpWS, PWS, and RCPWS rotations were 7, 4, and 10% higher than WS, respectively. The advantage of alternative rotations was that a deep rooted crop of winter wheat reaching down to 180 cm followed shallow rooted crops (sweet potato and peanut drawing soil moisture from 0 to 120 cm). They benefited from the sequencing and vertical complementarity of soil moisture extraction. Thus, replacing the traditional crop rotation with cropping system that involves rotating with annual shallow rooted crops is promising for reducing groundwater depletion in the North China Plain.","Increasing agricultural productivity without undermining further the integrity of the Earth’s environmental systems such as soil water balance are important tasks to ensure food security for an increasing global population in rainfed agriculture. The impact of intercropping maize (Zea mays L.) with potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) on yield, land equivalent ratios (LER), water equivalent ratio (WER), water use, energy output, and net economic return were examined under seven planting systems: potato grown solely or intercropped on the flat field without mulching, maize grown solely or intercropped with potato on ridges or flat field with or without plastic film mulched. The three intercropping systems had 3–13% less water use than the monocropping. Among the intercropped systems, flat field caused more depletion of soil water than ridged field for both years. Compared to monocultures, intercropping with plastic film mulching and ridging significantly increased LER and WER. Meanwhile, intercropping with mulching and ridging significantly increased net economic return and energy output by 8% and 24%, respectively, when compared to monocropping. These results suggest that maize under plastic film mulched ridge-furrow plot intercropped with potato under flat plot without mulching increased energy output, net economic return, and water use efficiency without increasing soil water depletion, which could be an optimal intercropping system for the semiarid farmland on the western Loess Plateau.","A field experiment was conducted during three seasons of 2018-19 at RPCAU, Pusa to evaluate the Effect of Residue Management and Cropping Systems on direct seeded rice and System productivity. Treatments comprised cropping systems in main plots: C1 Rice Wheat Fallow, C2 Rice Wheat Green Gram, C3 Rice Maize Dhaincha, C4 Rice Maize + Potato Dhaincha, C5 Rice Maize + Green Pea Dhaincha and moisture regimes in sub plots with 3 days disappearance of ponded water in kharif season, three levels of IW/CPE ratio in rabi season I1 IW/CPE = 0.6, I2 IW/CPE = 0.8, I3 IW/CPE = 1.0. Maximum number of tillers (273.55/m ), dry matter production (1464.91g/m 2 ), number of panicles/m 2 (267.80 m 2 ), grain yield (52.21q/ha) of rice was observed in C5 cropping system and panicle length (23.99 cm cm), number of grains /panicle (160.05), straw yield (69.58 q/ha) in C4 which was significantly superior than C1 cropping system. Plant height and 1000 grain weight, harvest index and Land Use Efficiency (LUE) were non significantly affected by different cropping systems.

Undernutrition is the more common form of malnutrition in developing countries, and results from insufficient intake of protein and/or energy, and may sometimes result from poor breastfeeding and/or complementary feeding practices. WHO recommends exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months of the baby’s life, followed by gradual introduction of complementary foods, with continuous breastfeeding till baby is at least two years. Most babies are not exclusively breastfed for six months, and even more not breastfed till 24 months. Most complementary foods in developing countries are homemade, with plant-based ingredients, using improper processing techniques, making them low in nutrient content. Aims: This work aimed at formulating Complementary foods from ten different proportions of local staples; yellow maize, rice, potatoes, egg whites, soybeans, pawpaw, watermelon, pineapple and oranges, using standard processing techniques. Methodology: The blends (A to J) were formulated and were evaluated for colour, taste, flavor and consistency using nine scaled hedonic point, and the preferred five were evaluated for proximate composition, some vitamins and minerals, functional properties, and for microbes using standard Association of Analytical Chemists (AOAC) methods. The results were statistically analysed using Microsoft excel, SPSS and Graphpad Instat softwares. Results: Results from sensory analysis showed that the preferred formulas were B, H, A, C, G, respectively. Moisture contents ranged from 4.6 - 10.5%, ash content ranged from 2.65 - 3.70%, fibre content ranged from 6.43 - 9.27%, protein content ranged from 17.72 - 37.72%, fat content ranged from 9.5 - 14%, carbohydrate content ranged from 38.74 - 63.58%, and energy content ranged from 394.9Kcal - 433.2Kcal. Micronutrient analysis revealed that all the formulas had no vitamin C, while they had vitamin A contents ranging from 95.85 - 2340IU. Calcium content ranged from 378 - 632mg/100g, iron content ranged from 4.73 - 8.59mg/100g, phosphorous ranged from 109.04 - 136.49mg/100g, and Zinc content ranged from 1.47 - 2.35mg/100g. Magnesium content ranged from 53.32 - 85.19mg/100g, sodium ranged from 2.42 - 189.41mg/100g, while potassium ranged from 319.2 - 728.82mg/100g. For functional properties, water absorption and oil absorption capacities ranged from 1.5 - 4.4 and 1.5 - 1.95 respectively, Loose and packaged bulk densities ranged from 0.51 - 0.54 and 0.78 - 0.92 respectively. The swelling index ranged from 1.03 - 1.11, foaming capacity and foam stability ranged from 2.0 - 18.0 and 0.0 - 0.7 respectively, while the dispersibilities ranged from 52.5 - 92.5%. Microbial analysis revealed that none of the formulas contained yeast, C had no coliform while formula B had highest coliform (620 CFUs), while C had highest TBC (31000CFUs). Conclusion: Formula C, with sweet potatoes as main starch source, looked most promising as a complementary food.","Starch-rich foods, such as cereal sources (rice, maize, and barley), are commonly used raw materials for extrusion cooking due to their excellent expansion characteristics. Other nonconventional starch sources like green banana, water chestnut, and potato can also be employed for extrusion cooking. The main aim of the study was to evaluate the extrusion behavior and sensory acceptability of nonconventional starch-rich food sources like rice, maize, barley, wheat, water chestnut, potato, and green banana. Maize, rice, wheat, potato, water chestnuts, barley, and green banana flour samples were evaluated for various physicochemical, pasting, and morphological properties, and were subjected to extrusion cooking at the moisture content of 15%, screw speed of 300 rpm, and barrel temperature of 125°C. The developed extruded snacks from selected crops were also evaluated for various physicochemical, pasting, and morphological properties. Potato flour and green banana flour recorded the highest starch content of 78.27 and 76.61%, respectively. The highest peak viscosity (6025 cp), trough viscosity (2968 cp), breakdown viscosity (3057 cp), pasting temperature (92°C), and minimum peak time (4.67 min) were recorded in the case of green banana flour. The structural assessment of all the flour samples was done through scanning electron microscopy. The highest expansion ratio (5.06), as well as overall acceptability (4.28), was recorded in the case of corn-based snacks. The highest bulk density and hardness were recorded in the case of barley-based snacks. The highest values of water absorption index and water solubility index were recorded in the case of green banana flour–based snacks.","Porridge is an important complementary food in many developing countries and it is mainly prepared from different blended flour. It is however, relatively cheap or inexpensive, being made from local available crop. In line with this, research was initiated to produce porridge from formulated with germinated maize, soybean and sweet potato flour to investigate the possibilities of improving the proximate composition, functional and sensory properties of complementary porridge. Nine -formulations of the composite flour were prepared using mixture design using Minitab software of version 16with a range of Germinated maize 30-70%, soybean20-40% and sweet potato 10-30%. Results showed significance difference (p<0.05) in bulk density of the composite flour. High blending ratio of soybean increased Moisture content, ash content and the sensory property like appearance taste and over all acceptability, whereas sweet potato increased the water absorption capacity of blended flour, oil absorption capacity blended flour and also increase aroma, taste of sensory property of porridge .The overall optimum point of all parameters are (moisture content4.4-5.06%, ash content1.8-5.4%, water absorption capacity200-131%, oil absorption capacity170.3-109 %, bulk density 0.4-0.2g/ml, and overall acceptance received hedonic ratings 4-4.75 were found in a range of germinated maize 30-70%, soybean 20-40% and sweet potato 10-20%. Therefore the study will be beneficial to most of the society who use porridge as important complementary food for his children.","BackgroundSweet potato, cocoyam, water yam, maize, millet, sorghum, and rice are major staple foods in Ghana. Flour from these roots and tubers and cereals are relatively cheaper, easy to produce and can be used in the manufacturing of wide range of products, including bread, cookies, meat pies, cake, chips and doughnut. However, due to the processing techniques used these flours may be contaminated with trace metals and aflatoxins. It was therefore necessary to determine the concentration of trace metal: As, Cu, Fe, Hg, Pb, Zn, and aflatoxin B1, B2, G1, and G2 in maize, sorghum, millet, rice, cocoyam, water yam and sweet potato flour samples used as composite flour for making bread and other pastries.ResultsThe trace metal concentration of essential metals: Cu, Fe and Zn in all the seven flour samples analyzed ranged from 0.03 ± 0.01 to 6.63 ± 0.02, 10.97 ± 0.01 to 201.40 ± 0.14, and 6.04 ± 0.03 to 34.36 ± 0.06 mg/Kg, respectively. The maximum concentrations of toxic metals: As, Hg and Pb determined in all the seven flour samples were < 0.01, < 0.01, and 0.05 ± 0.01 mg/Kg, respectively. Aflatoxin B1, B2, G1, and G2 were not detected in any of the samples.ConclusionThe concentrations of As, Cu, Hg, Pb and Zn determined in all seven flour samples were below the WHO set limits and therefore pose no health threat whiles Fe concentration in some flour samples was above the WHO set limit. Aflatoxin B1, B2, G1, and G2 were not detected in all flour samples and hence pose no health threat.","Abstract Malnutrition and food insecurity are major public health problems in developing countries including Ethiopia. Because of an economic issue and information gap, developing countries' survival depends on foods rich in carbohydrates but deficient in protein and micronutrients. However, it is paramount to mix ingredients that complement different nutritional profiles to alleviate the problem of malnutrition. Hence, in this research, maize, orange‐fleshed sweet potato, sweet lupine, and moringa leaf powder composites were used to develop nutritious instant porridge flour through extrusion cooking. Formulations containing powdered maize, orange‐fleshed sweet potato, sweet lupine, and moringa leaf were developed in the following ratios: 100:0:0:0, 50:35:10:5, 45:30:15:10, and 40:25:20:15, respectively. A completely randomized design was used to determine the blending effect on the functional properties, proximate composition, minerals, and beta‐carotene content of formulated instant porridge flour. Whereas, a randomized complete block design was used for the organoleptic characteristics data. Accordingly, the addition of orange‐fleshed sweet potato, sweet lupine, and moringa leaf powder to maize‐based porridge showed a significant (p < .05) increase in bulk density (0.70 ± 0.02 to 0.74 ± 0.03), water solubility index (10.09 ± 0.08 to 14.16 ± 0.23), protein (9.00 ± 0.00 to 21.10 ± 0.02), ash (1.43 ± 0.07 to 3.36 ± 0.08), fiber (1.55 ± 0.05 to 3.21 ± 0.01), fat (3.37 ± 0.02 to 5.37 ± 0.07), energy (370.89 ± 0.70 to 400.53 ± 0.65), vitamin A (0.00 to 41.00 ± 1.55), iron (3.49 ± 0.02 to 9.58 ± 0.29), zinc (2.89 ± 0.01 to 3.62 ± 0.06), and calcium (40.49 ± 0.42 to 113.34 ± 0.52) contents. However, water absorption index (4.76 ± 0.01 to 3.84 ± 0.01), moisture (8.50 ± 0.08 to 5.60 ± 0.04), and carbohydrate (76.11 ± 0.22 to 66.94 ± 0.02) content were decreased as a result of blending proportion compared to maize porridge (control). Formulated instant maize‐based porridge prepared from 50% maize, 35% orange‐fleshed sweet potato, 10% sweet lupine, and 5% moringa leaf powder scored the highest (above 4 out of 5 in a 5‐point hedonic scale) in all sensory attributes. In conclusion, the addition of orange‐fleshed sweet potato, sweet lupine flour, and moringa leaf powder has improved both macro‐ and micronutrients. Therefore, the development of nutritious maize‐based instant porridge formulated from readily available and underutilized crops can be achieved by extrusion cooking that helps to reduce the prevalence of malnutrition and food insecurity.","Starch films can be used as materials for food packaging purposes. The goal of this study is to compare how the starch origin influence the selected starch film properties. The films were made from various starches such as that from maize, potato, oat, rice, and tapioca using 50%w of glycerine as a plasticizer. The obtained starch-based films were made using the well-known casting method from a starch solution in water. The properties of the films that were evaluated were tensile strength, water vapour transition rate, moisture content, wettability, and their surface free energy. Surface free energy (SFE) and its polar and dispersive components were calculated using the Owens-Wendt-Rabel-Kaelbe approach. The values of SFE in the range of 51.64 to 70.81 mJ∙m−2 for the oat starch-based film and the maize starch-based film. The films revealed worse mechanical properties than those of conventional plastics for packaging purposes. The results indicated that the poorest tensile strength was exhibited by the starch-based films made from oat (0.36 MPa) and tapioca (0.78 MPa) and the greatest tensile strength (1.49 MPa) from potato.","Starch is a naturally occurring material showing high potential for use in food packaging because of its low cost, natural abundance and high biodegradability. Over the years, different starch-based packaging films have been developed, but the impact of botanical sources on film performance has rarely been exploited. Efforts devoted to exploiting the role played by the clusteroluminescence of starch in food packaging are also lacking. This study fills these gaps by comparing the properties of edible starch films generated from different botanical sources (including water chestnuts, maize and potatoes) in food packaging. Such films are produced by solution casting. They are highly homogeneous, with a thickness of 55–65 μm. Variations in the botanical sources of starch have no significant impact on the color parameters (including L*, a* and b*) and morphological features of the films but affect the water vapor permeability, maximum tensile strength and elongation at break. Starch films from water chestnut show the highest percentage of transmittance, whereas those from potatoes are the opaquest. No observable change in the intensity of clusteroluminescence occurs when a packaging bag generated from starch is used to package fresh or frozen chicken breast meat; however, a remarkable decline in the intensity of luminescence is noted when the frozen meat is thawed inside the bag. Our results reveal the impact of starch sources on the performance of starch films in food packaging and demonstrate the possibility of using the clusteroluminescence of starch as an indicator to reveal the state of packaged frozen food.","Most Non-alcoholic beverages (NABs) are produced from fruits, dairy, cocoa etc., but seldom from roots and tubers. This study aimed at producing NAB from cassava and sweet potato roots. Four different formulations were prepared; cassava roots : sweet potato roots - 100:0%, 90:10%, 70:30%, 50:50%. The clean, peeled, grated roots were weighed in percentages, blended and the juice extracted. The juice was allowed to stand, decanted, filtered and heated with maize malt, sugar, ginger and water and finally packaged hot. Consumer preference was done with 49 pane lists and pH, total solids, total soluble solids (TSS), titratable acidity (TA) and Vitamin C were determined on all formulations. Titratable acidity ranged from 0.51 to 0.77% with the 50:50 formulation being the highest. Total solids, varied significantly and ranged from 8.96 - 12.00% and the 90:10 formulation had the highest value. Vitamin C content was low with a range from 2.43-3.99mg/100g for 100:0 and 50:50% respectively. TSS of the beverages were within 8.50 and 10.50 with the 100% having the least value. Generally, as sweet potato percentage increased, the vitamin C content, TA, TSS increased but the pH decreased. The sensory results showed that there were no significant differences (p < 0.05) among the three different formulations that contained sweet potato but rather significant differences in overall acceptability and taste between the control (100% cassava) and the other samples. Generally the beverage had good consumer preference with the most preferred being the 50:50% formulation. The quality parameters of all formulations were within the acceptable quality range specified by Ghana Standards Authority for beverages. The potential to use liquid extract from cassava and sweet potato during processing for beverages is high. This could expand utilization base of the crops while reducing potential hazards of untreated water from root and tubers.","Starch-based pH-sensing films with bacterial nanocellulose (BNC) and red cabbage anthocyanins (RCA) as active components were investigated in this research. Their structural, physical, surface and colorimetric properties were analyzed, mainly as a function of BNC concentration. The aim of the research was to relate the changes in the intermolecular interactions between the components of the films (starch, anthocyanins and BNC) to the physical, surface and colorimetric properties that are important for the primary intended application of the produced films as pH indicators in smart packaging. The results showed that maize starch (MS) was more suitable as a matrix for the stabilization of anthocyanins compared to potato starch (PS). PS-based films showed a lower value of water contact angle than MS-based films, indicating stronger hydrophilicity. The swelling behavior results indicate that the concentrations of BNC in MS-based films (cca 10%) and the concentration of about 50% BNC in PS-based films are required if satisfactory properties of the indicator in terms of stability in a wet environment are to be achieved. The surface free energy results of PS-based films with BNC were between 62 and 68 mJ/m2 and with BNC and RCA between 64 and 68 mJ/m2; for MS-based films, the value was about 65 mJ/m2 for all samples with BNC and about 68 mJ/m2 for all samples with BNC and RCA. The visual color changes after immersion in different buffer solutions (pH 2.0–10.5) showed a gradual transition from red/pink to purple, blue and green for the observed samples. Films immersed in different buffers showed lower values of 2 to 10 lightness points (CIE L*) for PS-based films and 10 to 30 lightness points for MS-based films after the addition of BNC. The results of this research can make an important contribution to defining the influence of intermolecular interactions and structural changes on the physical, surface and colorimetric properties of bio-based pH indicators used in smart packaging applications.","Starches and flours used commonly in Asia (tapioca, sweet potato, sago, water chestnut, and high amylose maize starch, red rice and kithul flour) were characterized in terms of their chemical composition, morphological, functional, pasting, thermal, gelling and in vitro digestibility properties. It was observed that the differences in their chemical composition and structure influenced their properties. High amylose maize was the most stable, thus it required the highest gelatinization temperature which was observed in both the differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and pasting profiles. Kithul flour had a significantly lower rate of digestion (p < 0.05) than the other samples (except for high amylose maize starch). Unlike high amylose maize starch, it had a gelatinization temperature that could be achieved during cooking, and had good gelling properties.",19.9241353452884

Egypt is the largest and most dependent country on Nile water, with almost no rainfall. Groundwater is not renewable. Thus, the Nile water accounts for about 97% of Egypt's water resources and the share of the Egyptians is 55.5 billion m3, this quantity of water is insufficient to the needs of the population, and in order to maintain Egypt's per capita water, it needs about 80 billion m3, which means a deficit of 25 billion m3 and stability of Egypt's share of the Nile water under current local, regional and global conditions, and development of the appropriate strategy to alleviate the conflict with the basin countries Nile River so the study aimed to compare production efficiency and the economics of the irrigation systems used in the province of the lake through the study of water user associations in agriculture under the different irrigation patterns within water users association and outside association to rationalize the use of water and raising awareness to increase productivity. The results of the estimation indicated that the economic efficiency indicators of the maize and potato crop farmers in the sample of the field study show the preference of the use of the production function in the logarithmic formula to the different variables affecting the productivity of the crops according to the irrigation systems within the water user associations The results showed that the total production elasticity of maize crop was about 0.720, 0.530, 0.348 for sprinkler & drop, developed irrigation, and padded flooding systems, while the value of (R2) was about 0.76 , 0.60, 0.63  for irrigation systems respectively, The results showed that the total productivity of the potato crop was 1.127, 1.16, 1.318, for sprinkler & drop, developed irrigation, and padded flooding systems respectively, while the value of (R2) was about 0.76, 0.62, 0.70 for irrigation systems respectively. The relationship between the total costs and quantity produced of maize, which showed that the quadratic formula is the best formulas for the data, and the equations show that there is a statistically significant positive relationship between the total costs and production of maize in Behera Governorate. In the estimation of the optimal production volume, which reduces the costs is estimated at about 18.7, 22.1, 23.9 ardab/feddan, for sprinkler & drop, developed irrigation, and padded flooding systems respectively. In the estimation of the production volume which maximizes profit, the results showed that this volume was not reached, 29.1, 36.1, 31.9 ardab/feddan, for sprinkler & drop, developed irrigation, and padded flooding systems respectively. Calculating cost elasticity, it reached about 1.19, 0.804, 0.719, for sprinkler & drop, developed irrigation, and padded flooding systems respectively. In order to determine the optimal production volume of the potato crop, which reduces the costs, so make average cost equal marginal costs, estimated  at 12.539, 11.377, 11.064 tons/fed, for sprinkler & drop, developed irrigation, and padded flooding systems respectively. The size of production of potato that maximizes profit was about 42,500, 33.350, 25.600 tons/fed, for sprinkler & drop, developed irrigation, and padded flooding systems respectively.

The second scenario aims beside minimizing the water needs of cropping pattern, increasing export crop areas such as onions, peanuts, potatoes, tomatoes and other vegetables as much as possible, assuming situation stability of foreign trade.  The results of the analysis of the statistical models in the second scenario showed that the total quantity of irrigation water available for the cropping pattern was about 41.483 billion m3, while 38,471, 38.912, 38.803 billion m3 were used for the statistical models respectively, indicating that the required water quantities decreased by 3.013, 2.572, 2.681 billion m3, with a change rate of about 7.26, 6.20, 6.46%, for statistical models, respectively. The net return of the water unit for the actual cropping pattern was about 1.634 LE/m3, while it reached about 1.773, 1.830, 1.833 LE/m3 for the statistical models respectively, which shows the increase in the net return of water unit by 0.139, 0.197, 0.199 LE/m3, with a change rate of about 8.53, 12.04, 12.21%, for statistical models respectively.  Crop rotations can be applied to the new lands using water savings including (wheat and maize), with an area ranging from 2048 to 2399 thousand feddans, and including (wheat and summer and nili vegetables), with an area ranging from 2941 to 3444 thousand acres, also including (maize, winter and nili vegetables), with an area ranging from 3432 to 4021 thousand feddans. With regard to the impact of reducing the area of water crops to water gap which reached about 20.9 billion m3, it decreased by about 2.879, 2.758, 2.800 billion m3, which make water gap decreased to about 18.02, 18.14, 18.10 billion m3, with change rate of about 3.77, 3.61, 3.66%, for statistical models respectively, while the results of the second scenario show decreased of about 3.013, 2.572, 2.681 billion m3, which make water gap decreased to about 17.89, 18.33, 18.22 billion m3, with change rate of about 3.94, 3.37 and 3.51% for statistical models respectively. The research recommends the following points: 1. Reduce the areas of rice, sugar cane and alfalfa to save a quantity of water ranging between 2.572 - 3.013 billion m3 of land within the valley. 2. Using of water savings resulting from reducing the areas of water crops to expand the cultivation of new land with strategic and monetary crops. 3. Sugar beet area can be expanded at least to the extent that it covers the shortage of sugar production caused by reducing the sugar cane area, then taking into account and study the effects resulting from that. 4. Modification of cropping patern structure to be in accordance with the local, regional, environmental situations that may affect current and future water availability.","The research aimed to study the effect of reducing water voracious crop areas, such as (rice, sugar cane, bananas, alfalfa) on the available water quantity in the agricultural sector, where the data analysis showed that the most of the voracious crops especially rice and sugar cane are concentrated at the old lands within the valley as it explained in the research later, therefore, the research focused on inventory and analysis of the old land data within the valley to determine the best alternatives of the cropping pattern which achieves the state's goal of saving water and maximizing the return of the water unit, and is compatible with the current local, regional and environmental water conditions and the future developments that may occur in the future, that by using linear programming, through three models that have been formulated: the first is minimizing water requirement, the second model maximizes the net of acre return, while the third model maximizes the return of the water unit, using available data published and unpublished issued by the concerned authorities. The research focused mainly on the possibility of reducing the water needs of cropping pattern as a main objective, in addition to increasing the selfsufficiency ratios of strategic crops through the first scenario, and increasing the areas of export crops to increase the export proceeds through the second scenario, as far as possible within the available water and land area in the study area, using different statistical models. The results of the analysis of the statistical models in the first scenario showed that the total quantity of irrigation water available for the cropping pattern of the study crops reached 41.483 billion m3, while 38,604, 38.726, 38.683 billion m3 were used for the statistical models respectively, this indicates that the required water quantities decreased by 2.879, 2.758, 2.800 billion m3, with a change rate of about 6.94, 6.65, 6.75% for the statistical models, respectively. The net return of the water unit for the actual cropping pattern reached about 1.634 LE/m3, while it reached about 1.755, 1.767, 1.765 LE/m3 for the statistical models respectively, which shows the increase in net return of water unit by 0.122, 0.133, 0.131 LE/m3, with a change rate of about 7.46, 8.17, 8.05%, for statistical models respectively.

The current study examines how climate change may impact future irrigation requirements in Egypt's Upper Region using the medium greenhouse emission RCP 4.5 and high emission RCP 8.5 scenarios. Based on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and the Fifth Assessment Report, the climatic projections for RCPs 4.5 and 8.5 for the years 2023–2080 and 2081–2100 were used to determine the patterns of temperature and rainfall in the upper Egypt territory. The CROPWAT model was employed to estimate reference evapotranspiration (ETo) and net irrigation water requirement (NIWR) for the upper Egypt territory key crops sugar cane, potatoes, berseem clover (alfalfa), dry bean, wheat, cotton, maize, and tomato based on the predicted meteorological conditions. Five different scenarios for the key crops' future irrigation needs were calculated. The results reveal that under RCP 4.5 greenhouse emission for the periods 2023–2080 and 2081–2100, respectively, the overall NIWR for all examined crops increases by 5.1 and 5.9% in comparison to the current (2022) total NIWR for all crops. The total NIWR for all crops analyzed increases by 7.7 and 9.7% under the RCP 8.5 greenhouse emission scenario for the periods 2023–2080 and 2081–2100, respectively, in contrast to the current total NIWR for all crops. It is important to consider changes in water resource management in the MENA region, such as applying modern irrigation systems, using crop pattern rotation strategies with minimal water demands, and changing crop calendars or the times and locations of cropping activities.","Reducing agricultural water use is an inevitable choice to alleviate water shortage in arid and semi-arid regions, and high-efficiency irrigation technologies provide conditions for water conservation. However, without unified water resources management policy to redistribute the saved agricultural water, farmers’ behavior will lead to water rebound and large-scale expansion of cultivated areas, especially on the edge of oasis regions. To solve these issues and promote the sustainable development of water resources, it makes sense to explore the impact of unified water resources management policy from the perspective of farmers’ behavior. This study takes the typical irrigation zone in the Heihe River Basin as a case to discuss the response of farmers’ economic behavior to transferring irrigation water and restricting land reclamation, i.e., the unified water resources management policy with the technical efficiency of crop irrigation improved based on the bio-economic model. The results show that in the case of loosening land constraints, farmers will reuse all the saved water for agricultural production by reclaiming unused land or increasing the area of water-intensive crops (vegetables). Although the policy of restricting land reclamation can restrict land expansion, it cannot avoid water rebound caused by adjusting the crop-planting structure. Farmers’ land-expansion behavior can be largely restricted by transferring the saved irrigation water to non-agricultural sectors in irrigation zones with inadequate water, but to contain land-expansion behavior in irrigation zones with surplus water, the policy of restricting land reclamation must be implemented simultaneously. The study also reveals that farmers will choose to grow more cash crops (seed maize, vegetables, tomato, seed watermelon, potato, and rapeseed) and fewer food crops (wheat, maize) to increase the profit per unit of water in the scenario of loosening land constraints or transferring agricultural water. Furthermore, the study indicates that farmers’ economic income can be decreased or at least not increased with the transfer of agricultural water. Both benefit compensation from non-agricultural sectors and increased non-agricultural income can compensate farmers’ economic loss. Therefore, it is necessary to improve water rights trading systems and increase employment opportunities for surplus agricultural labor to promote economic development in rural areas.","A rapid development in economic sectors has induced the water depletion in most of the developing country, particularly for Malaysia. This study estimates the consumptive water use of cultivating 5 cash crops, i.e. cassava, maize, rice, sugarcane and sweet potato in Peninsular Malaysia. The consumptive water uses for cultivating these 5 crops was determined based on the CROPWAT 8.0 and Penman Monteith model. CROPWAT 8.0 model was used to compute the evapotranspiration and crop water requirement (effective rainfall and irrigation requirement) of the cash crops grown in Peninsular Malaysia from 2005-2013 (9 years). It was found that the green water uses for cultivating cassava, maize, paddy, sugarcane and sweet potato for Peninsular Malaysia is higher than the blue water use. In conclusion, water use for cultivating agricultural crops will accelerate the competition on the consumption of clean water with the other sectors. However, the availability of water resource in Peninsular Malaysia is sufficient to fulfil the demands for water at the present time.","In recent years, inequality in the distribution of tube wells and non-availability or non-accessibility of canal water during the rabi season leads to a lack of economic value fixation of irrigation water to crops. The main objective of this paper is to calculate the economic value of irrigation water for major crops in the Paliganj distributary of the Sone canal system and the Nalanda corridor site of tube well irrigation, Bihar, India using the Residual Value Method (RVM). Results revealed that the average irrigation water economic value on the basis of applied irrigation through the canal and tube well in the Paliganj distributary for rice, kharif maize, wheat, lentil, khesari, gram, rabi maize, potato, onion, and green gram crops was assessed as 3.73, 22.60, 11.67, 21.50, 27.42, 23.27, 14.75, 98.06, 84.92, and 27.17 Rs./m3, respectively. In the Nalanda corridor, the average irrigation water economic value of rice, kharif maize, wheat, lentil, gram, pea, mustard, potato, rabi maize, and green gram crops was assessed as 12.54, 24.61, 18.71, 44.15, 39.53, 37.85, 32.35, 96.93, 15.44, and 30.25 Rs./m3, respectively.","Irrigation monitoring is of great importance in agricultural water management to guarantee better water use efficiency, especially under changing climatic conditions and water scarcity. This study presents a detailed assessment of the potential of the Sentinel-1 (S1) Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data to detect irrigation events at the plot scale. The potential of the S1 data to detect the irrigation events was carried out using the Irrigation Event Detection Model (IEDM) over semi-arid and temperate oceanic climates in five study sites in south Europe and the Middle East. The IEDM is a decision tree model initially developed to detect irrigation events using the change detection algorithm applied to the S1 time series data. For each study site and at each agricultural plot, all available S1 images during the period of irrigation were used to construct an S1 time series and apply the IEDM. Different types of major summer irrigated crops were analyzed in this study, including Maize, Soybean, Sorghum and Potato, mainly with the sprinkler irrigation technique. The irrigation detection accuracy was evaluated using S1 images and the IEDM against the climatic condition of the studied area, the vegetation development (by means of the normalized difference vegetation index, NDVI) and the revisit time of the S1 sensor. The main results showed generally good overall accuracy for irrigation detection using the S1 data, reaching 67% for all studied sites together. This accuracy varied according to the climatic conditions of the studied area, with the highest accuracy for semi-arid areas and lowest for temperate areas. The analysis of the irrigation detection as a function of the crop type showed that the accuracy of irrigation detection decreases as the vegetation becomes well developed. The main findings demonstrated that the density of the available S1 images in the S1 time series over a given area affects the irrigation detection accuracy, especially for temperate areas. In temperate areas the irrigation detection accuracy decreased from 70% when 15 to 20 S1 images were available per month to reach less than 56% when less than 10 S1 images per month were available over the study sites.","This study was done to examine agricultural water and irrigation schedules for key crops grown in Kohima area of Nagaland, India, which has a humid subtropical climate. Climatic data over 16 years (2006–2021) were used to estimate crop water requirements using CROPWAT 8.0 model. Rice, maize, soybean, potato, cabbage, dry bean, ginger, and naga chili are the most common crops. ET0 was calculated using the FAO Penman–Monteith method and ranged from 1.41 to 3.65 mm/day. The USDA SCS approach calculated effective rainfall. The average annual ETC for rice, maize, ginger, soybean, bean (dry), potato, cabbage, and naga chili were 537.1, 305.7, 342.7, 292.2, 288.1, 364.3, 190.6, and 141 mm, respectively. Rice, maize, ginger, soybean, bean (dry), potato, cabbage, and naga chili require an average of 251.7, 54.9, 26, 73.1, 21.3, 21.9, 121.9, and 14.5 mm of irrigation each year, respectively. The crop irrigation schedules were created with 70% efficiency. The study emphasizes that irrigation must be adjusted to each crop's individual needs, whether through strategic scheduling or modifying net and gross irrigation volumes, to enhance water management and maximize crop production in the region.","Nowadays, nearly 90% of global water consumption is caused by irrigation activities, and more than 40% of the crops are produced under irrigated conditions. This study is an endeavour to estimate the irrigation water requirement (IWR) and crop water requirement (CWR) for some selected crops (Pepper, Eggplant, Potato, Soybean, Maize, Wheat Melon, Lettuce, Sunflower, Broadbean, Citrus, Cherry, Olive tree, Sugarbeet, Artichoke, Wine Grapes, Carrot...etc.) in Sothern Italy. The selected districts (Sant’ Arcangelo) have been taken as a case study area. Demanded meteorologically (rainfall, temperature, humidity, wind speed, sunshine hours) and crop data (crop coefficient and crop calendar) have been collected for 30 years period from 1981 to 2011. FAO CROPWATv8.0 software has been applied for requisite calculation of CWR and IWR along with the developing of cropping patterns. The FAO Penman-Monteith equation is used for estimating the reference evapotranspiration (ET0) by using meteorological data in the framework of CROPWAT model as it regarded as a good evaluator for a wide variety of climatic conditions. The analysis indicates that FAO Penman-Monteith suits very well for the study area and can be successfully used for the estimation of reference evapotranspiration. The important results in this study indicate that the IWR is very low from November to April (wintertime) due to higher rainfall intensity in these months and from month May to October a considerable amount of water is required for irrigation.","This provides insight into the current and future water situation in the East Nile Delta in Egypt. Additionally, the study aimed to identify gaps in knowledge that require further research and to illustrate the different types of models used to optimize water resources management and maintain food security.The study analyzed the status of water resources availability, water demand, and other influencing factors in the East Nile Delta. To address water scarcity, the study employed optimization models, specifically using linear optimization programming. This model was applied to the Eastern Delta area, focusing on the region supplied by the Ismailia Canal. The model aimed to balance the limited supply of freshwater with the increasing demand by proposing changes in cropping patterns.The study found that the best way to secure water supply and minimize water scarcity is by using optimization models. In the Eastern Delta, the area supplied by the Ismailia Canal had a water deficit of about 789.81 MCM. By changing the cropping patterns, the water deficit could be reduced. The results indicated a decrease in the cultivation of non-strategic crops such as onions, garlic, fruit trees, peanuts, sesame, and soybeans. Conversely, there was an increase in the cultivation of strategic crops such as wheat, cotton, maize, and corn, as well as crops with high net yields like tomatoes and potatoes. These changes would help balance water demand and supply, ensuring a more sustainable water management strategy for the future.",31.2191364789544

However, higher value to the extent of 2.44 mg kg -1 has also been reported by Wang Lixia (1979). The Cd concentration also increased with time. Mean Cd concentrations in soil increased form 1.13 mg kg -1 in 1979 to 1.94 mg kg -1 in 1987. Cadmium in agricultural soil is likewise relatively immobile under normal conditions, but could become more mobile under certain conditions such as increased soil acidity and its cadmium level may be enhanced by the usage of phosphate fertilizers manure or sewage sludge (Table 1). Nickel concentration in soil Contributions of nickel to soil arise from both natural and man-made sources. Among the farmer are parent bedrocks deposits enriched in nickel, micrometeorites and cosmic dust. The last two are of relatively little importance. Man-made source of nickel include smelting of nickel ferrous areas, metal refining, burning of coal, burning of petroleum products, disposal of waste sewage and sludge and fertilizer applications. The effects of manmade sources on the nickel contents of soil in generally local, although in certain cases industrial and other man made plumes of pollution combined with unusual climate condition may, disperse nickel over large regions of the earth. International Journal of Current Microbiology and Applied Sciences ISSN: 2319-7706 Volume 7 Number 10 (2018) Journal homepage: http://www.ijcmas.com Heavy metals like cadmium, nickel, lead, chromium, mercury etc are important environmental pollutants in areas with anthropogenic pressure. Their presence in the atmosphere, soil and water, even in traces can cause serious problems to all organisms. Heavy metal accumulation in soils is of great concern in agricultural production due to the adverse effects on food quality, crop growth (Ma et al., 1994) and environmental health. Heavy metal bioaccumulation in the food chain can be especially highly dangerous to human health. K e y w o r d s Toxicity, Cadmium and Nickel, Soil and Vegetables Accepted: 18 September 2018 Available Online: 10 October 2018 Article Info Int.J.Curr.Microbiol.App.Sci (2018) 7(10): 2341-2352 2342 The average nickel content of soil as given by Vinogradov (1959) is 40 mg kg -1 . Swaine (1955) given a wide range from 5 to 500 mg kg -1 Ni, our estimate of the average nickel content of soil calculated from a large number of analyses done in the Geological survey of Canada and those in the available world literature is 35 mg kg 1 . According to Page (1974), heavy metal constitutes only 0.1% of the sludge solids but, its content in soil may be significantly raised through long term land application of sludge Mahdy et al., (2007) reported that application of biosolids increases DTPA-extractable nickel. The levels of extractable Ni reach to 25.12 mg kg -1 in clay soil at the highest application rate where as in sandy soil the levels of extractable Ni was 17.18 mg kg -1 , while in calcareous soil it reached to 22.08 mg kg -1 at the highest application rate. Cadmium concentration and uptake in different vegetables Cadmium is taken up from soil by the plant roots. The plants grown on soils that are very sandy, acidic and are low in organic matter more easily absorb cadmium in soil attaches to clay particles & sandy soils with low clay content and organic matter induces higher uptake of cadmium. Lagarwerff (1971) studied Cd, Pb, and Zn uptake by radish grown on soil near a busy highway and observed a decrease in yield and metal content with increasing pH. An increase in Cd uptake by eight food crops due to the application of CdCl2 has been reported by John (1973). The result was supported by Jone et al., (1973) who showed that Cd either in salt form or sludge borne was readily available to soybean but never observed seed. Cd levels more than 1 mg kg 1 with addition of 87.1 mt ha -1 of digested sludge containing 129 mg kg -1 Cd. Satyaprakash (1992) reported that all crop species accumulated higher amount of Cd in their roots. Considering the average value, the Cd accumulation in different crop species was found in the order: Potato> Toria> Cauliflower> Faba bean> Cabbage> Amaranthus. Guttormsen et al., (1995) were conducted field trails over three year period with Chinese cabbage and carrots grown in a sandy soil. The NPK fertilizers containing 1, 30, 90 and 400 mg Cd kg -1 P were applied at the rate of 0.07, 2.1, 6.3 and 28 g Cd ha -1 yr -1 . The amounts of Cd added through phosphate rock also ranged between 0.1 and 28 g ha -1 yr -1 . The increased Cd application rates through NPK fertilizers increased the Cd concentration in both vegetables. The Cd uptake by both crops was significantly higher. Chinese cabbage exhibited lower Cd concentration than carrots. Carrot leaves contained higher Cd than its roots. Cadmium removals by Chinese cabbage and carrot were about 0.7 and 1.3 g ha -1 yr -1 , respectively. At pH 5.5, Cd concentrations in the two crops, based on a three year average, were 23 and 46% higher than at pH 6.5. Cadmium uptake by Chinese cabbage from different sources of phosphate rock was affected to a very limited extent. Cadmium concentration generally increased over the years. Cadmium concentration in shoots and roots varied both with different cadmium levels and type of vegetables. Generally cadmium accumulations in various plant parts in vegetables crops increased with the increasing cadmium concentration in the growth medium. Root cadmium increased more sharply than shoot cadmium. Celery contained higher Cd in the edible parts than other vegetable species (Ni et al., 2002). The cadmium concentration in each of the three parts varied with the level of cadmium and highest being in treatment receiving 100 mg kg -1 Cd. In this treatment, the level of cadmium accumulation in the stem, leaf and root was 3.36, 2.60 and 1.78 mg kg -1 dry weight, respectively. The results also show that Cd accumulation was the least in the root and most in the stem of all species (Table 2 and 3). Int.J.Curr.Microbiol.App.Sci (2018) 7(10): 2341-2352 2343 Nickel concentration and uptake in different vegetables Banin et al., (1981) reported higher content of Ni in plant with sewage water application than irrigation water and explained that the uptake of a given element appeared to be largely determined by its solubility in the soil solution and can be generally predicted by its ionic strength. Sailed and Kardos (1977) suggested that crop tolerance to Ni application varied with plant species and metal species. The Ni content of most species of vegetables usually didn’t exceed 10μg g -1 except for taxa growing on nickel rich soils where 10-100 μg g -1 Ni level was common. Use of Ni up to 125 mg kg -1 increased Ni content in alfalfa but did not exert pronounced influence on yield depression. 250 mg kg -1 ppm Ni treatment significantly increased Ni content and depressive effect on alfalfa yields (Taylor and Allinson, 1981). The Ni content in alfalfa varied from 0.5 to 9.4 mg kg -1 however, 300 mg kg -1 Ni in plants was recorded with the addition of 200 mg kg -1 Ni in soil. The linear relationship between Ni uptake by plants and the amount of applied Ni was reported (Valdares et. al., 1983). The maximum concentration of metal was found in spinach leaves followed by berseem, cauliflower and maize leaves, while the cauliflower heads had the lowest concentration (Kansal and Singh, 1983). The highest Ni contents was found in roots. Plant grown in pots absorbed more Ni than from the same soils in the field. The uptake of Ni in the shoots of all the crops increased significantly with increasing levels of Ni application. The nickel uptake in spinach increased from 19.4  g pot in control to 37.0.2  g pot with 80 mg kg soil but at higher levels of Ni application, there was decrease in Ni uptake. Similarly Ni uptake in fenugreek and coriander increased upto 60 and 120 mg kg -1 soil application and showed decreasing trend there after (AR MNS, Ludhiana 2004-05). Kumar (2005) reported that the Ni-concentration in different vegetable crops depended on the distance of the cropped site with respect to discharge point of sewage-sludge. Higher Ni concentration in different crop species grown on sewage irrigated soils were obtained as compared to those grown on the ground water irrigated soils. Different plant species varied in their Ni concentration in the sequence; Potato> Toria> Cauliflower> Amaranthus> Cabbage. The Nickel uptake by corn plants was significantly increased at all application rates in all soil studies and the corn plants grown in the clay soil had a higher assimilative capacity for uptake of Ni than other soils. The uptake values of heavy metals followed the following order; clay > calcareous > sandy soils. The Ni concentrations in all plant parts were higher in the biosolids treatment than in the control for all soils. Nickel concentration accumulated in parts of corn plants in the following order: roots> shoots. In general, application of biosolids significantly increased Ni concentration in shoots and roots of corn plants grown in all studies soils. The increase in Ni concentration peaked at the high level of biosolids application rate (3%) (Mahdy et al., 2007) (Table 4–7). Response of cadmium application Bingham et al., (1976) reported that soybean is most Sensitive crop where 25% reduction in yield by the soil application of as low as 5 to 15 ppm Cd. An increase in Cd content in soybean seed has also been reported by Ham and Dowdy (1978) due to sludge application. They observed that Cd addition through inorganic salt did not affect soybean yield but increased its concentration in soybean seed. Addition of cadmium to the soil lowered the dry matter yield of ryegrass and also reduced the yield of oat grain as reported by Allison and Dzialo (1980).

'Yungay'. Plants started from tissue culture-produced prenuclear minitubers of 'Yun- gay' were subjected to seven treatments, which included noncolonized (non-AMF) plants fertilized with Long Ashton nutrient solution modifi ed to supply P at 11 and 44 µg·mL -1 . All AMF plants received low P (11 µg·mL -1 ) and were inoculated with either a sierra-maize mixed isolate, sierra-papa mixed isolate, pure isolate of G. intraradices, sierra-maize mixed isolate + formononetin, or a sierra-papa mixed isolate + formononetin. Plants were grown in 3-L containers under shade house conditions in Lima, Peru. Non-AMF plants at low P had the poorest growth, while high P plants had the greatest overall growth. All AMF plants had greater growth, including a higher root to shoot ratio, higher phosphorus use effi ciency ((g tuber)/(g P/kg tissue)), and a lower leaf to tuber ratio (indicating greater leaf effi ciency in producing tuber dry matter), compared to non-AMF plants at low P. The mycorrhizal inoculation effect (MIE) ranged from +44% to +57%, indicating that 'Yungay' was mod- erately to highly mycorrhizal dependent. Plants colonized with the sierra-papa isolate + formononetin had the same tuber development and leaf to tuber ratio, compared to high P, non-AMF plants. Formononetin increased extraradical hyphae formation. Mycorrhizal enhancement was in part due to greater P, Fe, and Mg uptake, a higher phosphorus-use effi ciency and greater extraradical hyphae formation. vegetable crops, i.e., its N, P, and K require- ments are respectively 100%, 100%, and 33% greater than that required for tomato or pepper plant production (Maynard and Hochmuth, 1997). Normal fertilizer applications are around 1000 kg·ha -1 of 10-30-10 (10N-12.9P-8.3K). Subsistence growers may not have access or be able to afford suitable organic or inorganic fertil- izers. Modern sustainable agriculture systems are increasingly using reduced fertility inputs. Hence, there are excellent opportunities to in- corporate arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) as biofertilizers to enhance crop productivity and reduce fertilizer inputs. AMF increase nutrient and water uptake, alleviate cultural and environmental stresses and enhance disease resistance and plant health (Bethlenfalvay and Linderman, 1992; Davies, et al., 1993, 1996; Pfl eger and Linderman, 1994). AMF can enhance productivity of potatoes (Gra- ham et al., 1976; Niemira et al., 1995). In part this may be due to enhanced nutrient uptake of potato plants, particularly P (Black and Tinker, 1977; McArther and Knowles, 1993), as well as enhanced disease resistance (Niemira et al., 1996). In Columbia, experiments show that a considerable amount of P fertilizer can be saved when potatoes are inoculated with effective AMF (Sieverding, 1991). The highlands of Peru and Bolivia are the center of origin and diversity of the cultivated potato. Potato is the main staple crop in the highlands and accounts for 63% gross value of all crop production (Devaux et al., 1997). Average potato yields are very low (from 5 to 8 t·ha -1","To understand and explain soil moisture dynamics, the role of the vegetation is crucial. Hydrological processes in agricultural soils are strongly affected by rooting depth and root distribution. We present a new approach to monitor and model root dynamics and its influence on soil moisture using minirhizotrons combined with phenological observations. Field setups consist of a portable root scanner and acrylic glass tubes installed in the soil at the start of the growing season. 360° scans of soil and roots are taken regularly at different depths in the tubes. Root traits are identified automatically for each soil layer and complemented by observations of aboveground plant phenology. Results from minirhizotron data collected at an agrometeorological observatory in Germany show for both cereal and rapeseed (Brassica napus L.) crops a higher root density in deeper soil layers and a lower density near the soil surface when compared to literature data. An opposite picture emerged for maize (Zea mays L.) and potato (Solanum tuberosum L.), whereas vertical root distribution in sugar beet (Beta vulgaris subsp. vulgaris) had a different seasonal course than expected from literature. Applying the new root distribution data in calculations of the soil water balance resulted in differences of more than 3% in absolute volumetric soil water content. A comparison with in situ measurements of volumetric soil moisture at 20‐ and 50‐cm depth revealed a significant improvement of the model results due to the new parameterization. Thus, we argue that minirhizotrons constitute a useful supplement to hydrological observatories and can help understand and predict soil moisture dynamics in the critical zone.","Under drought stress, plants have developed various mechanisms to survive in the reduced water supply, of which the regulation of stress-related gene expression is responsible for several transcription factors. The basic leucine zippers (bZIPs) are one of the largest and most diverse transcription factor families in plants. Among the 10 Arabidopsis bZIP groups, group A bZIP transcription factors function as a positive or negative regulator in ABA signal transduction and drought stress response. These bZIP transcription factors, which are involved in the drought response, have also been isolated in various plant species such as rice, pepper, potato, and maize. Recent studies have provided substantial evidence that many bZIP transcription factors undergo the post-translational modifications, through which the regulation of their activity or stability affects plant responses to various intracellular or extracellular stimuli. This review aims to address the modulation of the bZIP proteins in ABA signaling and drought responses through phosphorylation, ubiquitination and sumoylation.","The root is an important plant organ, which uptakes nutrients and water from the soil, and provides anchorage for the plant. Abiotic stresses like heat, drought, nutrients, salinity, and cold are the major problems of potato cultivation. Substantial research advances have been achieved in cereals and model plants on root system architecture (RSA), and so root ideotype (e.g., maize) have been developed for efficient nutrient capture to enhance nutrient use efficiency along with genes regulating root architecture in plants. However, limited work is available on potatoes, with a few illustrations on root morphology in drought and nitrogen stress. The role of root architecture in potatoes has been investigated to some extent under heat, drought, and nitrogen stresses. Hence, this mini-review aims to update knowledge and prospects of strengthening RSA research by applying multi-disciplinary physiological, biochemical, and molecular approaches to abiotic stress tolerance to potatoes with lessons learned from model plants, cereals, and other plants.","To explore soil nutrients and moisture changes in different karst mountain agroforestry, in the plateau mountains of Southern China Karst, we used secondary tree and irrigation forest (C) as a reference for our study and selected four mixed agroforestry species (walnut + maize + potato (HYM), walnut + maize (HTY), poplar + ryegrass (YSH), and maize + ryegrass (YMH)) for comparison. First, soil moisture change characteristics were monitored in situ in the field. Second, for soil samples, soil bulk density, porosity, and permeability were analyzed, soil nutrient (K, Na, Ca, and Mg) characteristics were tested and analyzed. Then, we explored the relationship between agroforestry and soil moisture, soil moisture and soil nutrients, soil moisture and precipitation, and agroforestry and soil nutrients. It is shown (1) during the monitored period, variation trends in soil nutrients in four types of agroforestry was small, but it increased/decreased significantly compared with the secondary forest, which the variation range was more than 5%; (2) the changes of soil water content were significantly affected by precipitation, soil porosity and permeability, the moisture content changes of HYM, HTY, YSH, and YMH agroforestry were significantly correlated with precipitation, soil porosity, and permeability; (3) under the same precipitation conditions, different types had different lags on soil water regulation, with the average HYM 0.8 h, HTY 0.6 h, YSH 0.3 h, and YMH 0.4 h, each type soil responded at 2–3 h after rain, and the soil moisture content returned to the normal level; and (4) the variation of soil moisture content fluctuated seasonally, and the most obvious was HYM and HTY agroforestry, their Cv value between winter and summer exceeded 21%. The results provide basic theoretical support for further exploring the relationship among agroforestry, soil, moisture, and nutrients and enrich the content of the development of agroforestry in karst areas. They are of importance to promote ecological restoration and agroforestry development in karst areas.","Organic amendments can improve soil quality which has knock-on environmental and agronomic benefits. However, the use of new and emerging organic amendments such as biochar and brown coal waste (BCW) in soil systems requires continuous holistic assessments for robust consensus building in their environmental and agricultural applications. To examine the application of BCW and woodchip biochar (BIO) in agroecosystems, secondary data from literature on environmental (soil, air and water) aspects were compiled with primary agronomic data from a 3-year multicropping field trial and collated with supplementary data on economic factors (e.g. cost and availability). For the field trial, replicated plots were amended with FYM (for comparative reasons), BCW and BIO at 30, 24.2 and 12.8 for t ha–1, respectively, with and without NPK and cultivated in a cropping sequence of maize, potato and barley. At the end of each season, soils were characterised for pH, cation exchange capacity (CEC) and fertility (macronutrient contents) in addition to nutrient uptake, nutritional quality and yield of crops. Compared with FYM, biochar and BCW were found to be associated with greater improvements in soil quality (e.g. building of soil structure and C sequestration) and knock-on water and air quality benefits mainly facilitated via increased cation retention and humic-linked sorption which abated gaseous emission and mitigated nutrient and heavy metal leaching. These along with variable improvements in soil chemistry, fertility and nutrient uptake in the agronomic field trial accounted for increased mean crop yield across treatments (higher with NPK): FYM (32.7 and 71.7%), BCW (33.5 and 60.1%) and BIO (21.8 and 48.2%). Additionally, biochar and BCW have lower pollutant (e.g. heavy metals) contents and were found to provide additional sustainability and net abatement cost-benefits. While the agronomic benefits of biochar and BCW were slightly lower compared with that of FYM, their lower environmental footprints and associated sustainability benefits are clear advantages for their adoption in environmental and agricultural applications.","Potato is the fourth most important food crop after rice, wheat and maize in the North-East plains of India. India is the second largest potato producing country in the world after China, with annual production of 42.48 million tonnes from area of 1.93 million hectare, while in Uttar Pradesh area, production and productivity of potato is 0.55 m ha, 13.57 m tonnes and 24.67 tonnes ha -1 , respectively (Anonymous, 2013). Being a heavy feeder of nutrients, potato required high amount of nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium. Chemical fertilizer is the main source of nutrients use for potato cropping. However, continuous dependence of chemical fertilizer causes nutritional balance and adverse effects on physic-chemicals and biological properties of soil. Integrated nutrient management is a bitter approach for supplying nutrient or food to the crop by including organic and inorganic source of nutrient (Arora, 2008). Further imbalance and indiscriminate use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides resulted several harmful effects on soil, water and air causing International Journal of Current Microbiology and Applied Sciences ISSN: 2319-7706 Volume 6 Number 3 (2017) pp. 1429-1436 Journal homepage: http://www.ijcmas.com","The aim of this study was to estimate bentazone’s potential to leach to groundwater in the Arenosols developed from sand, Luvisols developed from loamy sand or sandy loam, and Luvisols or Cambisols developed from loess, and to identify the major factors influencing bentazone’s fate in the soils. Potato and maize cultivations were simulated using the FOCUS PELMO 5.5.3 pesticide leaching model. The amount of bentazone reaching groundwater was highly sensitive to degradation parameters, water-holding capacity, evapotranspiration, organic carbon content, and pH. The highest bentazone concentrations in percolate were noted in Arenosols. The risk of bentazone concentration exceeding 0.1 μg/L was low only in Arenosols with high organic carbon content (3.0% for topsoil or higher). In Luvisols developed from loamy sand or sandy loam, the estimated bentazone concentrations in percolate were highly dependent on the climate. In Luvisols or Cambisols developed from loess, concentrations of >0.1 μg/L were the least likely due to the high water-holding capacity and high organic carbon content of these soils. The study also revealed that the FOCUS Hamburg scenario, representing the coarsest soils in the European Union with relatively low organic carbon content, does not reflect the leaching potential of Arenosols and Luvisols.","The water status in plant leaves is a good indicator for the water status in the whole plant revealing stress if the water supply is reduced. The analysis of dynamic aspects of water availability in plant tissues provides useful information for the understanding of the mechanistic basis of drought stress tolerance, which may lead to improved plant breeding and management practices. The determination of the water content in plant tissues during plant development has been a challenge and is currently feasible based on destructive analysis only. We present here the application of a non-invasive quantitative method to determine the volumetric water content of leaves and the ionic conductivity of the leaf juice from non-invasive microwave measurements at two different frequencies by one sensor device. A semi-open microwave cavity loaded with a ceramic dielectric resonator and a metallic lumped-element capacitor- and inductor structure was employed for non-invasive microwave measurements at 150 MHz and 2.4 Gigahertz on potato, maize, canola and wheat leaves. Three leaves detached from each plant were chosen, representing three developmental stages being representative for tissue of various age. Clear correlations between the leaf- induced resonance frequency shifts and changes of the inverse resonator quality factor at 2.4 GHz to the gravimetrically determined drying status of the leaves were found. Moreover, the ionic conductivity of Maize leaves, as determined from the ratio of the inverse quality factor and frequency shift at 150 MHz by use of cavity perturbation theory, was found to be in good agreement with direct measurements on plant juice. In conjunction with a compact battery- powered circuit board- microwave electronic module and a user-friendly software interface, this method enables rapid in-vivo water amount assessment of plants by a handheld device for potential use in the field.",17.6663290706185
