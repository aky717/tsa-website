This study utilizes remote sensing data from 2001 to 2020 to compute drought indices categorized as meteorological, agricultural, and hydrological. A Gaussian kernel convolves these indices into a denoised, multi-band composite image. Further refinement with a Gaussian kernel enhances a single drought index from each category: Reconnaissance Drought Index (RDI), Soil Moisture Agricultural Drought Index (SMADI), and Streamflow Drought Index (SDI). The enhanced index, encompassing all bands, serves as a predictor for classification and regression tree (CART), support vector machine (SVM), and random forest (RF) machine learning models, further improving the three indices. CART demonstrated the highest accuracy and error minimization across all drought categories, with root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) values between 0 and 0.4. RF ranked second, while SVM, though less reliable, achieved values below 0.7. The results show persistent drought in the Sahel, North Africa, and southwestern Africa, with meteorological drought affecting 30% of Africa, agricultural drought affecting 22%, and hydrological drought affecting 21%.","Soil moisture (SM) is a fundamental constituent of the terrestrial environment and the hydrological cycle. Owing to its significant influence on catchment hydrological responses, it can be utilized as an indicator of floods and droughts to aid early warning systems. This study aimed to develop a field‐scale method to estimate SM using parametric and machine learning‐based methods to compare whether advanced artificial intelligence methods can give similar results as traditional methods. Considering this, monthly observed SM data (from the top 10 cm), environmental covariates, and remotely sensed data from March 2019 to July 2021 for the Cathedral Peak Research Catchments VI and IX in South Africa were obtained. From the 241 observations obtained across 12 sites, 160 (∼66%) were used for model training, while the remaining 81 (∼34%) were used for model testing. Employing 10‐fold cross‐validation, the individual machine learning models (viz., support vector machine [SVM], random forest (RF), k‐nearest neighbor, classification and regression trees [Rpart], and generalized linear model) displayed a satisfactory performance (R2 = 0.52–0.79; root mean square error = 3.79–5.80). In the validation phase, the RF model displayed a superior performance, followed by the SVM. Subsequent SM estimation using the hybrid model produced satisfactory results in training (R2 = 0.90) and testing (R2 = 0.45). The results obtained from this study can aid in predicting SM variations in catchments with limited monitoring. Furthermore, this model can be applied in drought monitoring, forecasting, and informing agricultural management practices.","Fruit-tree crops generate food and income for local households and contribute to South Africa’s gross domestic product. Timely and accurate phenotyping of fruit-tree crops is essential for innovating and achieving precision agriculture in the horticulture industry. Traditional methods for fruit-tree crop classification are time-consuming, costly, and often impossible to use for mapping heterogeneous horticulture systems. The application of remote sensing in smallholder agricultural landscapes is more promising. However, intercropping systems coupled with the presence of dispersed small agricultural fields that are characterized by common and uncommon crop types result in imbalanced samples, which may limit conventionally applied classification methods for phenotyping. This study assessed the influence of balanced and imbalanced multi-class distribution and data-sampling techniques on fruit-tree crop detection accuracy. Seven data samples were used as input to adaptive boosting (AdaBoost), gradient boosting (GB), random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and eXtreme gradient boost (XGBoost) machine learning algorithms. A pixel-based approach was applied using Sentinel-2 (S2). The SVM algorithm produced the highest classification accuracy of 71%, compared with AdaBoost (67%), RF (65%), XGBoost (63%), and GB (62%), respectively. Individually, the majority of the crop types were classified with an F1 score of between 60% and 100%. In addition, the study assessed the effect of size and ratio of class imbalance in the training datasets on algorithms’ sensitiveness and stability. The results show that the highest classification accuracy of 71% could be achieved from an imbalanced training dataset containing only 60% of the original dataset. The results also showed that S2 data could be successfully used to map fruit-tree crops and provide valuable information for subtropical crop management and precision agriculture in heterogeneous horticultural landscapes.","Abstract. Conversion of natural forest (NF) to other land uses could lead to significant changes in catchment hydrology, but the nature of these changes has been insufficiently investigated in tropical montane catchments, especially in Africa. To address this knowledge gap, we aimed to identify stream water (RV) sources and flow paths in three tropical montane sub-catchments (27–36 km2) with different land use (natural forest, NF; smallholder agriculture, SHA; and commercial tea and tree plantations, TTP) within a 1021 km2 catchment in the Mau Forest complex, Kenya. Weekly samples were collected from stream water, precipitation (PC) and mobile soil water for 75 weeks and analysed for stable isotopes of water (δ2H and δ18O) for mean transit time (MTT) estimation with two lumped parameter models (gamma model, GM; and exponential piston flow model, EPM) and for the calculation of the young water fraction. Weekly samples from stream water and potential endmembers were collected over a period of 55 weeks and analysed for Li, Na, Mg, K, Rb, Sr and Ba for endmember mixing analysis (EMMA). Solute concentrations in precipitation were lower than in stream water in all catchments (p < 0.05), whereas concentrations in springs, shallow wells and wetlands were generally more similar to stream water. The stream water isotope signal was considerably damped compared to the isotope signal in precipitation. Mean transit time analysis suggested long transit times for stream water (up to 4 years) in the three sub-catchments, but model efficiencies were very low. The young water fraction ranged from 13 % in the smallholder agriculture sub-catchment to 15 % in the tea plantation sub-catchment. Mean transit times of mobile soil water ranged from 3.2–3.3 weeks in forest soils and 4.5–7.9 weeks in pasture soils at 15 cm depth to 10.4–10.8 weeks in pasture soils at 50 cm depth. The contribution of springs and wetlands to stream discharge increased from a median of 16.5 (95 % confidence interval: 11.3–22.9), 2.1 (−3.0–24.2) and 50.2 (30.5–65.5) % during low flow to 20.7 (15.2–34.7), 53.0 (23.0–91.3) and 69.4 (43.0–123.9) % during high flow in the natural forest, smallholder agriculture and tea plantation sub-catchments, respectively. Our results indicate that groundwater is an important component of stream water, irrespective of land use. The results further suggest that the selected transit time models and tracers might not be appropriate in tropical catchments with highly damped stream water isotope signatures. A more in-depth investigation of the discharge dependence of the young water fraction and transit time estimation using other tracers, such as tritium, could therefore shed more light on potential land use effects on the hydrological behaviour of tropical montane catchments.","Land use change is known to affect suspended sediment fluxes in headwater catchments. There is however limited empirical evidence of the magnitude of these effects for montane catchments in East Africa. We collected a unique 4‐year high‐frequency data set and assessed seasonal sediment variation, water pathways, and sediment response to hydrology in three catchments under contrasting land use in the Mau Forest Complex, Kenya's largest tropical montane forest. Annual suspended sediment yield was significantly higher in a smallholder agriculture‐dominated catchment (131.5 ± 90.6 t km−2 yr−1) than in a tea‐tree plantation catchment (42.0 ± 21.0 t km−2 yr−1) and a natural forest catchment (21.5 ± 11.1 t km−2 yr−1) (p < 0.05). Transfer function models showed that in the natural forest and the tea‐tree plantations subsurface flow pathways delivered water to the stream, while in the smallholder agriculture shallow subsurface and surface runoff were dominant. There was a delayed sediment response to rainfall for the smallholder agriculture and the tea‐tree plantations. A slow depletion in sediment supply suggests that the wider catchment area supplies sediment, especially in the catchment dominated by smallholder farming. In contrast, a fast sediment response and depletion in sediment supply in the natural forest suggests a dominance of temporarily stored and nearby sediment sources. This study shows that the vegetation cover of a forest ecosystem is very effective in conserving soil, whereas catchments with more bare soil and poor soil conservation practices generated six times more suspended sediment yield. Catchment connectivity through unpaved tracks is thought to be the main explanation for the difference in sediment yield.","Abstract. Agricultural catchments in the tropics often generate high concentrations of suspended sediments following the conversion of natural ecosystems. The eroded fine particles are generally enriched with carbon (TC) and nutrients (TN and TP) originating from the topsoil of agricultural land. Sediment-associated TC, TN and TP are an important loss to the terrestrial ecosystem and tightly connected to an increase in riverine particulate TC and nutrient export. Soil nutrient depletion can limit crop growth and yields, whereas an excess of nutrients in streams can cause eutrophication in freshwater systems. Streams in East Africa, with widespread land conversion from forests to agriculture, are expected to receive high loads of sediment-associated TC, TN and TP. In this study, we assess the effect of land use on particulate TC, TN and TP concentrations. Suspended sediments (time-integrated, manual-event-based and automatic-event-based sediment samples) were analysed for TC, TN and TP concentrations collected at the outlet of a natural montane forest (35.9), a tea-tree plantation (33.3) and a smallholder agriculture (27.2 km2) catchment in western Kenya during a wet sampling period in 2018 and a drier sampling period in 2019. Particulate TC, TN and TP concentrations were up to 3-fold higher (p<0.05) in the natural forest catchment compared to fertilized agricultural catchments. However, because of higher sediment loads from the smallholder agriculture catchment, the total sediment-associated loads of TC, TN and TP were higher compared to the natural forest and tea-tree plantation catchment. The higher C:N ratios in the natural forest suggest that the particulate nutrients are of organic origin due to tighter nutrient cycles, whereas lower ratios in both agricultural catchments suggest a mixture of mineral and organic sediment sources. The findings of this study imply that with the loss of natural forest, the inherent soil fertility is progressively lost under the current low fertilization rates and soil management strategies.","Crop area extent estimates and crop type maps provide crucial information for agricultural monitoring and management. Remote sensing imagery in general and, more specifically, high temporal and high spatial resolution data as the ones which will be available with upcoming systems, such as Sentinel-2, constitute a major asset for this kind of application. The goal of this paper is to assess to what extent state-of-the-art supervised classification methods can be applied to high resolution multi-temporal optical imagery to produce accurate crop type maps at the global scale. Five concurrent strategies for automatic crop type map production have been selected and benchmarked using SPOT4 (Take5) and Landsat 8 data over 12 test sites spread all over the globe (four in Europe, four in Africa, two in America and two in Asia). This variety of tests sites allows one to draw conclusions applicable to a wide variety of landscapes and crop systems. The results show that a random forest classifier operating on linearly temporally gap-filled images can achieve overall accuracies above 80% for most sites. Only two sites showed low performances: Madagascar due to the presence of fields smaller than the pixel size and Burkina Faso due to a mix of trees and crops in the fields. The approach is based on supervised machine learning techniques, which need in situ data collection for the training step, but the map production is fully automatic.","Peat swamp forests are the second rarest forest type found in South Africa while dune forests have been un- der severe threat through mining and agriculture. Both forest types exist in the conservation area, and World Heritage site, known as the iSimangaliso Wetland Park on the East coast of South Africa. The area is prone to severe droughts (Taylor et al., 2006) and recent attempts to understand the local wa- ter balance revealed that there was insufficient information on the water use of the indigenous forests of the area. The peat swamp forest and dune forest sites studied in this re- search were located within close proximity to each other, yet, are characterised by different landscape positions in terms of water availability. The coastal dune forest soil profile was generally dry and sandy and the tree roots did not have ac- cess to the water table. In contrast the peat swamp forest is located in an interdunal wetland where the trees have perma- nent access to water. The climate at both sites is subtropical with a mean annual precipitation of 1200 mm yr 1 . However, over 20 months of measurement, the first summer (October 2009 to March 2010) was drier (424 versus 735 mm) than the second summer (October 2010 to March 2011) emphasising the variability of the rainfall in the area and providing a wide range of conditions measured. The sap flow of an evergreen, overstory Syzygium cor- datum and a semi-deciduous, understory Shirakiopsis ellip- tica were measured in the peat swamp forest using the heat ratio method. The Syzygium cordatum water use was not highly seasonal and the daily maximum water use ranged from approximately 30 L d 1 in winter to 45 L d 1 in sum- mer whereas the Shirakiopsis elliptica water use was more seasonal at 2 L d 1 in winter and 12 L d 1 in summer. The water use of the Syzygium cordatum was not influenced by seasonal rainfall variations and was actually higher in the drier summer (October 2009 to March 2010). Three trees of different heights were monitored in the same way in the dune forest and the water use found to be highly seasonal. Over the entire measurement period, the water use was highest for an emergent Mimusops caffra (5 to 45 L d 1 ), whereas the wa- ter use of the Eugenia natalitia (2 to 28 L d 1 ) and Drypetes natalensis (1 to 4 L d 1 ) was lower. At the dune forest, the water use was highest in the wetter summer due to the re- liance of the trees on rainfall to recharge the soil water. A split-line regression showed that on average, soil water lim- ited tree water use 64 % of the time over the measurement period at the dune forest. For modelling tree water use at the dune forest, it was concluded that a two-stage model, tak- ing soil water content into account (from multiple sampling points), would be necessary.","South Africa has a long history of recurrent droughts that have adversely affected its economic performance. The recent 2015 drought has been declared the most serious in 26 years and impaired key agricultural sectors including the forestry sector. Research on the forests’ responses to drought is therefore essential for management planning and monitoring. The effects of the latest drought on the forests in South Africa have not been studied and are uncertain. The study reported here addresses this gap by using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)-derived normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and precipitation data retrieved and processed using the JavaScript code editor in the Google Earth Engine (GEE) and the corresponding normalized difference infrared index (NDII), Palmer drought severity index (PDSI), and El Niño time series data for KwaMbonambi, northern Zululand, between 2002 and 2016. The NDVI and NDII time series were decomposed using the Breaks for Additive Seasonal and Trend (BFAST) method to establish the trend and seasonal variation. Multiple linear regression and Mann–Kendall tests were applied to determine the association of the NDVI and NDII with the climate variables. Plantation trees displayed high NDVI values (0.74–0.78) from 2002 to 2013; then, they decreased sharply to 0.64 in 2015. The Mann–Kendall trend test confirmed a negative significant (p = 0.000353) trend between 2014 and 2015. This pattern was associated with a precipitation deficit and low NDII values during a strong El Niño phase. The PDSI (−2.6) values indicated severe drought conditions. The greening decreased in 2015, with some forest remnants showing resistance, implying that the tree species had varying sensitivity to drought. We found that the plantation trees suffered drought stress during 2015, although it seems that the trees began to recover, as the NDVI signals rose in 2016. Overall, these results demonstrated the effective use of the NDVI- and NDII-derived MODIS data coupled with climatic variables to provide insights into the influence of drought on plantation trees in the study area.","Rain-fed farming is the primary livelihood of semi-arid west Africa. Changes in land cover have the potential to affect precipitation, the critical resource for production. Turbulent flux measurements from two eddy-covariance towers and additional observations from a dense network of small, wireless meteorological stations combine to relate land cover (savanna forest and agriculture) to evaporation in a small (3.5km2) catchment in Burkina Faso, west Africa. We observe larger sensible and latent heat fluxes over the savanna forest in the headwater area relative to the agricultural section of the watershed all year. Higher fluxes above the savanna forest are attributed to the greater number of exposed rocks and trees and the higher productivity of the forest compared to rain-fed, hand-farmed agricultural fields. Vegetation cover and soil moisture are found to be primary controls of the evaporative fraction. Satellite-derived vegetation index (NDVI) and soil moisture are determined to be good predictors of evaporative fraction, as indicators of the physical basis of evaporation. Our measurements provide an estimator that can be used to derive evaporative fraction when only NDVI is available. Such large-scale estimates of evaporative fraction from remotely sensed data are valuable where ground-based measurements are lacking, which is the case across the African continent and many other semi-arid areas. Evaporative fraction estimates can be combined, for example, with sensible heat from measurements of temperature variance, to provide an estimate of evaporation when only minimal meteorological measurements are available in remote regions of the world. These findings reinforce local cultural beliefs of the importance of forest fragments for climate regulation and may provide support to local decision makers and rural farmers in the maintenance of the forest areas.",17.1860326430765,2,"water, veget, soil"

The tested SSR markers showed a high level of polymorphism. A total of 188 alleles were detected at the 22 loci ranging from three to 21 with an average of 8.54 alleles per locus. The average of heterozygosity for all cultivars was 0.503; genetic distance among cultivars varied from 0.171 to 0.938 indicating diverse relationships. The cultivar Ghanami Akhder was highly divergent from ‘Ghnami Ahmer’, whereas ‘Jamal Al-Dean’ was very closely related to ‘Qitaz’. Unweighted pair group method arithmetic average ordered date palm cultivars into two main clusters. Principal coordinate analysis exhibited the similar clusters of cultivars as in the dendrogram. Date palm (2n = 2x = 36) is considered of great socioeconomic importance in the Arabian region. The tree has been, and is still, at the center of comprehensive agricultural development. It is believed to have originated from Mesopotamia (Wrigley, 1995). The numbers of known date palm cultivars that are distributed all over the world are 5000 of which 600 are found in Iraq. Iraq is one of the largest date-producing countries in the world. Before 1991, Iraq was the largest producer of dates in the world (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, 2008) and had the largest date forest in the world (MacFarquhar, 2003). However, during the Gulf and Iran–Iraq wars, large numbers of date palm trees were destroyed. Wars and sanctions imposed on Iraq have negatively affected both the production and natural genetic diversity of the crop in Iraq and inhibited the much-needed impetus to rebuild the date palm industry. Development of suitable DNA molecular markers for this crop may allow researchers to estimate genetic diversity, which will ultimately lead to the genetic conservation of date palm. The success of particular genetic conservation or breeding programs is dependent on understanding the amount and distribution of the genetic variation already present in the genetic pool (Jubrael et al., 2005). Morphological traits have been used to describe such genetic variation in date palm cultivars (Barreveld, 1993), which are mainly related to the fruit and influenced by the environment (Askari and Al-Khalifah, 2003; Sedra et al., 1993, 1998). In addition, biochemical studies, including isozyme and activity analyses of peroxidases, have been used to characterize date palms in Morocco and Tunisia (Baaziz, 1988; Baaziz and Saaidi, 1988; Bendiab et al., 1998; Majourhat et al., 2002; Ould Salem Mohamed et al., 2001). As such, analysis does not reflect precisely that polymorphisms occurred (Al-Jibouri and Adham, 1990). DNA marker analysis in date palm is recently in the development stage. Askari and Al-Khalifah (2003) analyzed the genetic diversity among 13 different cultivars using random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) markers. Similar reports are published for North African cultivars (Hussein et al., 2002; Sedra et al., 1998). Amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) markers (Vos et al., 1995) were also been used for genetic fingerprinting and mapping for this crop. Jubrael et al., (2005) and Khierallah et al. (2011) used AFLP fingerprinting to characterize a number of Iraqi date palm cultivars. Microsatellites, also known as SSR, are ideal DNA markers for population studies and genetic mapping as a result of their abundance, high level of polymorphism, dispersion throughout diverse genomes, ease to assay by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and ease to disseminate among laboratories (Udupa and Baum, 2001). Microsatellite markers were used for investigation of genetic diversity in date palm (Billotte et al., 2004). Zehdi et al. (2004) applied these markers to characterize Tunisian cultivars, whereas Al-Ruqaishi et al. (2008) used these primers to screen and analyze the genetic diversity among clonal genotypes of Omani cultivars. Recently, many researchers in date palm-producing countries have used SSR markers to genotype cultivars. Elshibli and Korpelainen (2008) investigated genetic diversity in Sudan germplasm representing 37 female and 23 male accessions using 16 SSR primers. In Qatar, Ahmed and Al-Qaradawi (2009) used 10 primers to analyze genetic Received for publication 27 Jan. 2011. Accepted for publication 24 June 2011.

(2010) developed 1000 SSR markers in date palm, mining genome sequencing data for this vital crop. The aim of this study is intended to characterize the genotype for 30 Iraqi important date palm cultivars using SSR markers. Materials and Methods PLANT MATERIALS. Leaves were collected from 30 welldefined reference Iraqi date palm cultivars grown in date palm stations belong to the Ministry of Agriculture (Table 1). Twenty-two female cultivar samples were collected from AlMahaweel Date Palm Station, Hilla Governorate, 80 km south of Baghdad. The remaining eight cultivar samples were collected from Al-Za’afarania Date Palm Station, Baghdad (Fig. 1). Total genomic DNA was extracted from young and healthy leaves according to the procedure mentioned by Benito et al. (1993) with minor modifications. After purification, the resultant DNA was quantified on 1% agarose gel electrophoresis as described by Sambrook et al. (1989). MICROSATELLITE AMPLIFICATION. A total of 33 date palmspecific primer pairs were tested; 16 of them were developed by Billotte et al. (2004) and 17 were developed by Akkak et al. (2009) as indicated in Table 2. PCR was performed in a total mixture of 20 mL containing: 13.9 mL H2O, 50 ng of total cellular DNA (2 mL) as template, 1 mL/PCR buffer (Roche, Mannheim, Germany), 1 mL of 0.2 mM of dNTP PCR mix (Roche), 0.1 mL (0.625 U) of Taq DNA polymerase (Roche) and1 mL of 0.2 mM of each primer using forward primer end labeled (6FAM, NED, or TET). Amplifications were performed in a thermocycler (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA) under the following conditions: a denaturation step of 5 min at 95 C followed by 35 cycles of 30 s at 95 C, 1 min at 52 C and 1 min at 72 C, and a final extension step at 72 C for 7 min. At the testing stage, amplification products were separated by electrophoresis according to their molecular weight in 1.4% agarose gels and then detected by staining with ethidium bromide as described by Sambrook et al. (1989). The DNA profiles were visualized on an ultraviolet transilluminator and documented by using a gel documentation system (Alpha Innotech Imaging Station; Cell Biosciences, Santa Clara, CA). For final analyses, 2 mL of amplified DNA (diluted to 1/10) and 8 mL of (Rox) DNA standard size (Applied Biosystems) were loaded into 96-well plates. Genotyping was carried out using an automatic DNA analyzer (Model 3100; Applied Biosystems). Amplifications were performed at least twice and only reproducible products were taken into account for further data analysis. SIMPLE SEQUENCE REPEAT GENOTYPING. Electropherogram data were analyzed by using Foundation Data Collection software (Genetic Analyser Data Collection Version 2.0; Applied Biosystems). Allele size scoring was performed by Gene Mapper software (Version 3.7; Applied Biosystems). The Jaccard similarity matrix (Jaccard, 1908) was used for cluster analysis using the unweighted pair group method arithmetic average to study the genetic relationships among the cultivars. Jaccard similarity index, major allele frequency, heterozygosity, gene diversity, and polymorphism information content estimation were done using a software package (PowerMarker Version 1.31; Liu and Muse 2005). The phylogenetic diagram was drawn by PAST software [Version 1.91 (Hammer et al., 2001)] on the basis of Hamming similarity index with 100 bootstrap. Principal coordinate analysis (PCA) was performed according to Euclidean similarity index using the PAST software.","Monanthotaxis bali is the only known, solely montane (occurring solely above 2000 m alt.) species of the genus. It joins Monanthotaxis orophila (Rwanda) and M. discolor (Tanzania), two other species that can also occur above 2000 m alt. Monanthotaxis bali is an addition to the small number (28) of the tree species of the surviving montane forests of the Cameroon Highlands of which only eight other species are endemic. Due to its supra-axillary inflorescences, and petals arranged in one whorl but with the outer petals overlapping the inner petals distally, and rounded flower buds, the new species is placed in Hoekstra’s clade B of Monanthotaxis. The new species is unusual in being a treelet in a predominantly lianescent genus, and in lacking the glaucous underside of the leaf-blades that usually characterises the genus. Monanthotaxis bali takes the number of continental African species of the genus to 80, and makes Cameroon, with 30 species, the most species-diverse country for the genus. Monanthotaxis bali is known only from the Bali Ngemba Forest Reserve, a forest remnant under pressure of degradation and clearance in the Bamenda Highlands of Cameroon. It may already be extinct due to logging and agricultural activities. Here it is described, illustrated, mapped and assessed as Critically Endangered (Possibly Extinct) using the IUCN 2012 criteria.","Auger beetles (Coleoptera: Bostrichidae), also known as false powderpost beetles, are serious pests of trees, forest products, agricultural crops, and stored vegetable products in most regions of the world (Fisher 1950; Lawrence 2010). There are approximately 570 species in 89 genera worldwide (Lawrence 2010), including approximately 73 native species found in North America (Ivie 2002). Most woodboring bostrichids obtain nutrition from starch, enabling many species to utilize almost any dry wood material from an enormous host range (Ivie 2002). The frequency of non-native bostrichid interceptions at ports of entry and storage facilities around the world has increased during the last decade (Teixeira et al. 2002; Ratti 2004; Filho et al. 2006; Aukema et al. 2011; EPPO 2011; Price et al. 2011). Bostrichids, along with many other woodboring insects, are often accidentally introduced inside solid wood packing material in containerized cargo (Haack 2006). The bostrichid genus Sinoxylon Duftschmid contains 52 species, all of which are native to Asia, Africa, and Southern Europe (Borowski & Wegrzynowicz 2007) and are typically not considered primary pests. Sinoxylon species utilize a wide variety of hosts, including numerous trees, shrubs, herbaceous plants, and bamboos (Filho et al. 2006). Sinoxylon damage is typically caused by the boring of adults and larvae in the stems, branches, or twigs of dead, damaged, or stressed hosts (Nair 2007). One species has even been known to damage lead cables (Filho et al. 2006). Species of Sinoxylon are frequently intercepted in the U.S.A., representing 32% of bostrichid interceptions between 1985 and 2000 (Haack 2006; Price et al. 2011). There have been 289 Sinoxylon interceptions in the U.S.A. between 2007 and 2012 (Brian Saunders, USDA-APHIS-PPQ, Cape Canaveral, Florida, personal communication). In the continental U.S.A., there are 2 established non-native species of Sinoxylon. Sinoxylon anale Lesne and S. conigerum Gerstacker are both established in southern Florida (Peck & Thomas 1998). Another species, S. ceratoniae (L.), may be established in California (Ivie 2002). Sinoxylon anale Lesne is the most economically important and most commonly intercepted species of Sinoxylon, typically arriving in solid wood packing materials (Fisher 1950; Argaman 1987; Teixeira et al. 2002; Sittachaya et al. 2009; Beaver et al. 2011). Sinoxylon anale is native to the Indomalaya and Palearctic ecozones, where it attacks more than 70 species of plants. In the United States, Price et al. (2011) reported 2 interceptions of S. anale in Georgia in 2004 and 2010, both arriving from India in solid wood packing materials. Borowski and Wegrzynowicz (2007) list 3 other species, S. japonicum Lesne, S. sexdentatum (Olivier) (as S. muricatum (L.)), and S. ruficorne Fahaeus, as introduced into the United States, but these records are apparently based on the interceptions reported by Fisher (1950) that do not represent established populations. On 29 Aug 2011 in West Point, Mississippi, United States (N 33°36’25” W 88°39’01”), a substantial infestation of larval and adult Sinoxylon indicum Lesne (Fig. 1A) and S. sudanicum Lesne (Fig. 1B) was discovered in wooden crates and pallets that originated from Pakistan. It is not known if the wood used to construct the crates originated in Pakistan, or whether the wood was treated according to IPPC international standards","Root feeding bark beetles in the genus Hylastes Hylastes breeding in loblolly pine across 3 crown (Coleoptera: Curculionidae: Scolytinae) commoncondition classes (healthy, dying, dead).

We formally characterise and name this species as Deinbollia onanae (Sapindaceae-Litchi clade) and we discuss it in the context of the assemblage of montane tree species in the Cameroon Highlands of West-Central Africa. The new species is a shade-bearing, non-pioneer understorey forest tree species reaching 15 m high and a trunk diameter that can attain over 40 cm at 1.3 m above the ground. Seed dispersal has been recorded by chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes ellioti) and by putty-nose monkeys (Cercopithecus nictitans) and the species is used by chimpanzees for nesting. Cameroon has the highest species-diversity and species endemism known in this African-Western Indian Ocean genus of 42, mainly lowland species. Deinbollia onanae is an infrequent tree species known from six locations in surviving islands of montane (sometimes also upper submontane) forest along the line of the Cameroon Highlands, including one at Ngel Nyaki in Mambilla, Nigeria. Deinbollia onanae is here assessed as Endangered according to the IUCN 2012 standard, threatened by severe fragmentation of its mountain forest habitat due to extensive and ongoing clearance for agriculture. The majority of the 28 tree species of montane forest (above 2000 m alt.) in the Cameroon Highlands are also widespread in East African mountains (i.e. are Afromontane wide). Deinbollia onanae is one of only seven species known to be endemic (globally restricted to) these highlands. It is postulated that this new species is morphologically closest to Deinbollia oreophila, a frequent species at a lower (submontane) altitudinal band of the same range. Detailed ecological data on Deinbollia onanae from the Nigerian location, Ngel Nyaki, where it has been known under the name Deinbollia “pinnata”, is reviewed.","Deinbollia onanae (Sapindaceae-Litchi clade) is here formally named and characterised as a new species to science, previously known as Deinbollia sp. 2. Cameroon has the highest species-diversity and species endemism known in this African-Western Indian Ocean genus of 42 species. Deinbollia onanae is an infrequent tree species known from five locations in surviving islands of montane (or upper submontane) forest along the line of the Cameroon Highlands. It is here assessed as Endangered according to the IUCN 2012 standard, threatened mainly by clearance of forest for agriculture. The majority of tree species characteristic of montane forest (above 2000 m alt.) in the Cameroon Highlands are also widespread in East African mountains (i.e. are Afromontane). Deinbollia onanae is one of only a very small number of species that are endemic (globally restricted to) the mountain range. It is postulated that this new species is in a sister relationship with Deinbollia oreophila, which is a frequent species of a lower (submontane) altitudinal band of the same range. It is further postulated that seed dispersal is or was by frugivorous birds, potentially turacos, alternatively by primates such as Preuss s monkey.","Four subsets of apple (Malus Mill.) germplasm representing modern and old cultivars from the repository and apple genetics population of the Horticulture and Food Research Institute of New Zealand Limited were used in this study. A total of 155 genotypes randomly chosen from the four subsets were analyzed for random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) variation. Nine decamer primers generated a total of 43 fragments, 42 of which were polymorphic across the 155 genotypes. Pairwise distances were calculated between germplasm subsets using the distance metric algorithm in S-PLUS, and used to examine intra-and inter-subset variance components by analysis of molecular variation (AMOVAR). A phenogram based on unweighted pair group method with arithmetic average (UPGMA) cluster analysis was constructed from the pairwise distances and a scatter plot was generated from principal coordinate analysis. The AMOVAR showed that most of the variation in the germplasm (94.6%) was found within subsets, suggesting that there is significant variation among the germplasm. The grouping of genotypes based on the phenogram and scatter plot generally did not reflect the pedigree or provenance of the genotypes. It is possible that more RAPD markers are needed for determining genetic relationships in apple germplasm. Nevertheless, the variation observed in the study suggests that the current practice of sublining populations in the first generation to control inbreeding may not be necessary in subsequent generations. If these results are confirmed by fully informative molecular markers, germplasm managers should reassess the structure of their genetics populations. There may be a need to combine sublines in order to capture the maximum genetic diversity available and to streamline breeding efforts. genetic resources in germplasm collections and successive stages of development in breeding programs. More specifically, knowledge of genetic diversity and relationships among sets of germplasm and the potential merit of the genetic diversity is critical to plant improvement (Lee, 1995). In 1990, the Horticulture and Food Research Institute of New Zealand Limited (HortResearch), established a population improvement program to broaden the genetic base and, at the same time study the genetics of horticulturally important traits in apples. An apple genetics population was developed from imported seed and pollen from apple cultivars and varieties from clonal repositories in major apple producing regions in Europe, North America, Australia, Asia and South Africa (Noiton and Shelbourne, 1992). Seeds of accessions of Malus sieversii (Lebed.) were also obtained from Kazakhstan—the presumed center of origin of the cultivated apples (Hokanson et al., 1997). These seedlings have been planted in research orchards in a recurrent selection breeding strategy and maintained at multiple sites to allow for evaluation of general and regionally important horticultural traits and biotic and abiotic resistances. We as germplasm managers now need to assess the level of diversity within this collection to help make informed decisions on management procedures as well as on the choice of breeding strategies to use in combining horticulturally important traits in our breeding program. Historically, assessments of genetic composition of germplasm collections have been carried out at several levels including inferences based on reproductive biology, ecogeographic data, morphology, pigmentation, ontogeny, social history, pedigree records, breeding behavior, in situ and ex situ evaluation of traits, chromosome structure and behavior, protein markers, and molecular markers such as restricted fragment length polymorReceived for publication 10 July 2000.

The consequences of loss of genetic diversity have been experienced sporadically throughout history, often with significant human and economic costs, which has been a common problem with many of the world’s important food crops (Way et al., 1990). The genus Malus (apples), is characterized by large diversity, but thus far this has not been translated in the cultivated (Malus sylvestris (L) Mill. var. domestica (Borkh.) Mansf.) varieties (Way et al., 1990). Modern commercial apple orchards are dominated by only a few cultivars and many breeding programs utilize only a few well known cultivars in crosses for commercial apple production (Noiton and Shelbourne, 1992; Way et al., 1990). As a result, levels of inbreeding and coancestry in modern apples have been projected to increase (Noiton and Alspach, 1996). Awareness of genetic diversity and management of crop genetic resources have been important components of plant improvement programs. The foundation of crop-based agriculture rests largely on the availability and knowledge of extant plant phisms (RLFPs). The emergence of new polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based molecular markers, such as randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) markers, simple sequence repeats (SSRs), and amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs), has created opportunities to characterize germplasm collections at the molecular level, with markers that are presumably selectively neutral and not affected in their expression by environmental effects. The increased levels of variation detectable with these molecular markers have allowed germplasm managers, plant breeders, and geneticists to pursue with new vigor important questions relating to crops and their genetic resources (Bretting and Widrlechner, 1995). RAPD analyses have various scientific, operational, and budgetary advantages for genome mapping (Welsh and McClelland, 1990, 1991; Williams et al., 1990) and are used with a high degree of success as tools for harnessing genes from germplasm resources in our own apple genome mapping program (Gardiner et al., 1996a, 1999). These same advantages also appear valid for characterization of genetic variation for effective germplasm conservation and use, hence research in population genetics has shown the most growth with respect to the use of RAPD technology (Hedrick, 1992). RAPD markers have been used to create DNA fingerprints for the study of individual identity and taxonomic relationships in both eucaryotic and procaryotic organisms (Caetano-Anolles et al., 1991; Hu and Quiros, 1991; Kresovich et al., 1992); in apples, to differentiate cultivars (Koller et al., 1993), for paternity analysis (Harada et al., 1993), for determining genetic relationships in Malus sylvestris var. domestica cultivars and wild species (Dunemann et al., 1994), along with RFLPs and isozymes for tracing the parentage of ‘Braeburn’ (Gardiner et al., 1996b), and for phylogenetic studies (Zhou and Li, 2000). The following research was conducted to examine the distribution of genetic diversity in the HortResearch apple germplasm collection using RAPD markers. The objectives of the investigation were to 1) assess the level of diversity between and within different subsets of apple germplasm, 2) determine the similarity of the selections/cultivars within the collections and 3) determine if the gene pool of apples had been effectively enlarged with the germplasm obtained from other countries and continents. Materials and Methods PLANT MATERIAL. The HortResearch apple germplasm was divided into four subsets. Subset 1 consisted of old cultivars and breeding lines that are maintained in the repository and the National Cultivar Center (NCC), and subsets 2, 3 and 4 consisted sublines in the apple genetics population. The apple genetics population comprised open-pollinated (op) families as well as families derived from controlled crosses from primitive cultivars, cider apples, and wild species (Noiton et al., 1999), including wild accessions of Malus sieversii (Lebed.) and M. kirghisorum (Al.) Ponom. from Kazakhstan. The families were divided into four sublines and planted at the third leaf stage in randomized incomplete blocks of 20 single tree plots at three different sites over a period of 4 years as follows: 1991: 224 families (10,232 trees); 1992: 149 families (12,800 trees); 72 families (4,862 trees); and 1994: 86 families (3,665 trees). Sublining was used to control inbreeding and maximize, as far as possible, genetic variability and heterozygosity within the population (Noiton and Shelbourne, 1992). We crossed within sublines per generation since inbreeding is unlikely to be a serious problem for many generations. Nevertheless, we had planned to introduce new unrelated material after a few generations to circumvent inbreeding. Ideally, the families should have been grouped into sublines based on region of origin so that individuals from the same region will be confined to one subline. For example, families from countries in Western Europe should be in a different subline than families from countries in North America or Eastern Europe. But this never really happened in our own case, due in part to the fact that seeds were","Abstract: Vepris bali is the first known species of Vepris in WC Africa with opposite, trifoliolate leaves and is further unusual for its long petiolules. Known only from Bali Ngemba Forest Reserve, a remnant of submontane forest under great pressure of degradation in the Bamenda Highlands of Cameroon, it may already be extinct due to tree cutting and agricultural incursions. Here, V. bali is compared with other endemic cloud forest Vepris of the Cameroon Highlands and is described, illustrated, mapped and assessed as Critically Endangered (Possibly Extinct) using IUCN 2012 criteria.

The prevalence of these species might result from ancient slash-and-burn agricultural activities that created large openings, while a decline of these activities since the colonial period could explain their deficit of regeneration. To verify this hypothesis, we compared soil charcoal abundance, used as a proxy for past slash-and-burn agriculture, and tree species composition assessed on 208 rainforest 0.2 ha plots located in three areas from Southern Cameroon. Species were classified in regeneration guilds (pioneer, non-pioneer light-demanding, shade-bearer) and characterized by their wood-specific gravity, assumed to reflect light requirement. We tested the correlation between soil charcoal abundance and: (i) the relative abundance of each guild, (ii) each species and family abundance and (iii) mean wood-specific gravity. Charcoal was found in 83% of the plots, indicating frequent past forest fires. Radiocarbon dating revealed two periods of fires: “recent” charcoal were on average 300 years old (up to 860 BP, n = 16) and occurred in the uppermost 20 cm soil layer, while “ancient” charcoal were on average 1900 years old (range: 1500 to 2800 BP, n = 43, excluding one sample dated 9400 BP), and found in all soil layers. While we expected a positive correlation between the relative abundance of light-demanding species and charcoal abundance in the upper soil layer, overall there was no evidence that the current heterogeneity in tree species composition can be explained by charcoal abundance in any soil layer. The absence of signal supporting our hypothesis might result from (i) a relatively uniform impact of past slash-and-burn activities, (ii) pedoturbation processes bringing ancient charcoal to the upper soil layer, blurring the signal of centuries-old Human disturbances, or (iii) the prevalence of other environmental factors on species composition.","Ceratocystis . Ceratocxstiopsis and  Ophiostoma are important pathogens of trees and some agricultural crops and have recently been found on proteas and forest trees in South Africa.

This rev iew summarises current knowledge of ascospore shape and development of the centrum obtained from light and electron microscope studies of Cemtocystis sensu lato . Important questions requiring further investigations are outlined.

This study aims at providing quantitative information on floristic composition and structure of the Lama secondary forests (Benin), so as to contribute to their restoration, and fill part of knowledge gaps on West African secondary forests. Data of 77 permanent plots each of 0.5 ha were used to analyze the floristic composition, the trajectory of the recovery and the recovery of stocking in these forests, compared to nearby old-growth forests. The results showed that the forests were less diversified with few species very common in the forest stands; the most dominant were Lonchocarpus sericeus and Anogeissus leiocarpa in the secondary forests, and Dialium guineense , Diospyros mespiliformis and Afzelia africana in the old-growth forests. The secondary forests hold more species than the mature ones. Their compositions will recover that of the original forest because species of the original forest were actively regenerating in the secondary forests. About 28 years after recovery, large trees were insufficient and basal area was about 60% of those of the mature forests. Further studies are needed to elucidate barriers to tree regeneration and dynamics of tree population. © 2016 International Formulae Group. All rights reserved.

These have conservation value if they provide habitat for threatened wildlife and maintain connectivity between larger habitats. Riverine forests have particular ‘corridor’ potential due to their linear shape, but are under-studied in many regions. We surveyed trees in riverine fragments in Bulindi, an anthropogenic landscape 25 km south of the Budongo Forest in western Uganda, to determine their condition and assess their value for wildlife, particularly endangered chimpanzees Pan troglodytes. We assessed tree composition, structure and diversity and compared results with a previous survey made in Budongo, the nearest main forest block. Riverine fragments were considerably less species-dense and species-rich than Budongo. Community composition differed markedly between sites and there was virtually no overlap in common species. Common trees in fragments were characteristic of East African swamp and groundwater forests (e.g. the palm Phoenix reclinata) and the dominant tree family was the Moraceae, members of which produce fleshy fruits attractive to frugivores (e.g. figs). Important fruit foods for chimpanzees differed between habitats. While basal area of important fruit trees was comparable, overall density was greater in fragments. Our data suggest the riverine fragments offer a relatively food-dense habitat for chimpanzees and other frugivores. Small riverine forests have little or no protection regionally and are being extensively logged and cleared for agriculture. Species logged for timber in Bulindi included important chimpanzee fruit trees. Unless conservation projects successfully reverse current trends, the value of the riverine corridors for maintaining connectivity between main forest blocks is limited.","Abstract Weekly Prostephanus truncatus (Horn) flight activity, measured as the density of captured beetles in pheromone baited traps, was monitored for 76 consecutive weeks at 16 sites inside the Lama forest in southern Benin and at four sites in maize farmland just outside the forest. Prostephanus truncatus flight activity was consistently higher and the flight activity pattern significantly different near maize stores than at sites inside the forest. Although P. truncatus is known to infest girdled branches of Lannea nigritana (Sc. Elliot) Keay, the P. truncatus flight activity was comparatively low at forest sites where this tree species dominated. The main peak in P. truncatus flight activity occurred earlier in the eastern part of the forest compared with other forest parts. Ordination analysis showed that comparatively higher flight activity in the eastern part of the forest was positively associated with the presence of teak plantations (Tectona grandis L. F.) at trap sites. The spatial distribution of weekly P. truncatus trap catches were found to be significantly aggregated during a 21-wk period, which largely coincided with the early increase in P. truncatus flight activity in the eastern part of the forest. Based on this evidence, it was suggested that P. truncatus individuals disperse from the eastern part of the forest to other forest parts and to nearby agricultural areas, rather than, as has been previously suggested, from maize stores to the forest environment.","In South Africa, much of the forest biome is vulnerable to human-induced disturbance. The forest-dwelling butterfly Charaxes xiphares occidentalis is naturally confined to a small forest region in the south-western Cape, South Africa. Most of the remaining habitat of this species is within a fragmented agricultural matrix. Furthermore, this geographical area is also heavily invaded by alien plants, especially Acacia mearnsii . We investigated how C. x. occidentalis behaviourally responds to different habitat conditions in the landscape. We were particularly interested in touring, patrolling and settling behaviour as a conservation proxy for preference of a certain habitat configuration in this agricultural matrix. Remnant forest patches in the agricultural matrix showed fewer behavioural incidents than in a reference protected area. Moreover, dense stands of A. mearnsii negatively influenced the incidence and settling pattern of this butterfly across the landscape, with fewer tree settlings associated with more heavily invaded forest patches. This settling pattern was predominantly seen in female butterflies. We also identified specific trees that were settled upon for longer periods by C. x. occidentalis . Distance to a neighbouring patch and patch size influenced behavioural incidences, suggesting that further patch degradation and isolation could be detrimental to this butterfly. Conservation implications: We highlight the importance of clearing invasive tree species from vulnerable forest ecosystems and identify key tree species to consider in habitat conservation and rehabilitation programmes for this butterfly. We also suggest retaining as much intact natural forest as possible. This information should be integrated in local biodiversity management plans.","The East African coastal forests are subject of haphazard modification following anthropogenic pressures including tree cutting and clearing for agriculture. These activities, which are leading cause of habitat disturbance and species loss, are the major challenge in the management of sensitive wildlife species such as forest understory birds. This study investigated species composition of understory birds in the coastal forests of northeastern Tanzania to generate information for the management of the landscape and biodiversity in the area. Using mist nets, birds were trapped from core and edge habitats of representative forest patches. Trapped birds were classified to species level and categorized into bird guilds based on their levels of forest dependence. It was found out that species richness was influenced by forest patch size rather than level of habitat disturbance. Edge habitat was also found to be important in hosting higher number of forest understory birds, especially generalists—but this should be treated with caution because following habitat destruction that is ongoing in the study area, there is a danger of generalist wiping out specialist species due to competitive exclusion. Strict control measures to stop illegal tree cutting and agricultural activities near the forests were recommended for sustainable conservation of the understory birds in the forests.","In sub-Saharan Africa, anthropogenic activities such as cocoa (Theobroma cacao) farming have replaced the natural forest vegetation, making agricultural environments more readily available to some species of bats. To augment bat conservation in such highly modified agro-environments, we evaluated the foraging decisions of the widely distributed Noack’s round-leaf bat (Hipposideros aff. ruber) in a Ghanaian agro-environment for two factors: (a) foraging durations and (b) habitat selection from radio telemetry data collected from 13 bats. We hypothesized that it opportunistically selects foraging habitats in proportion to its availability. Our compositional analysis revealed, however, a nonrandom use of habitats. A ranking matrix indicated Hipposideros aff. ruber uses all available habitats but strongly preferred seminatural habitats dominated by fallow lands. Cocoa farms were predominantly used as flight paths for commuting between roosts and other nearby habitats during foraging. We observed a mean foraging duration of 109 min (SD = 62 min) per night for the species. In conclusion, our data suggest that (a) they are flexible in selecting all habitat types in the agro-environment but strongly preferred fallow matrices, (b) the provision of canopy trees within the agro-environment serves as flight paths for commuting from roost to habitats offering higher prey densities, and (3) the maintenance of fallow matrices as conservation units in sub-Saharan agro-environments helps augment conservation efforts of the species.","“Secondary” forests are very different to “primary”, “noble” forests with their tall trees. Their exuberant, inextricable vegetation, with more lianas and small shrubs than trees, grows on formerly forested lands cleared for agriculture. In inhabited regions, they generally sur¬round villages and grow along roadsides, pushing the primary forest back to rocky hillsides and swamps. In Equatorial Af¬rica, “secondary” forests account today for 50 to 75% of all forested areas. These forests form in three stages: (i) seedlings appear of fast-growing sun-loving species (Musanga sp., Vernonia sp., Anthocleista sp.), which are not the same as primary forest species and which disperse their seeds over long distances; (ii) formation of an understorey, made up of the same shrub species as in “primary” forests but mixed in this case with a second group of banal sun-loving species characteristic of “secondary” forests, which quickly grow as high as the first group and sometimes higher; (iii) gradual reconstitution of “pri¬mary” forest with abundant Sapotaceae, Guttiferae and hard-wooded legu-minous species that are capable of regenerating in the undergrowth and through which some very tall trees eventually grow through the canopy. Okoume (Aucoumea klaineana), a valuable species typical of “secondary” forests, is common in the so-called “primary” forests of Gabon, which in fact are on formerly cleared forest land. Today, the high potential of these “sec¬ondary” forests must not be allowed to “go up in smoke”. Quite the reverse: we must learn to guide their development to hasten the establishment of commercially valuable species. Abstract adapted by the editorial team.

My main aim was to explore community response to the influence of land use change. By comparing the structure and community attributes of the beetles between 35-year-old secondary forests and primary forests, I expected to give indications on the conservation value of the old secondary forests for beetle conservation. Community structure significantly differed among land-use types. Species richness, abundance and biomass were significantly higher in forest habitats than in meadows. The cover of ground vegetation, soil clay content and tree diameter are important factors structuring Coprini communities in karst ecosystems of Pu Luong. The secondary forests, after 35 years of regrowth showed similarities in species richness, abundance and biomass to primary forests. This gives hope for the recovery of Coprini communities during forest succession. Keywords: Coprini, dung beetles, karst ecosystems, land use change, Pu Luong. References: [1] I. Hanski, Y.

Conservation research for migratory birds in the tropics has focused overwhelmingly on shade coffee plantations and adjacent forest, but both cover types are now in decline, creating an urgent need to evaluate conservation opportunities in other agricultural systems. Here we compare how a community of 42 Neotropical migratory bird species and a subset of five conservation-priority species differ in usage and habitat associations among a secondary forest baseline and four expanding commercial plantation systems in Guatemala: African oil palm, teak, rubber, and mixed-native hardwoods. We found that mixed-native hardwood plantations supported the highest richness and diversity of all migrants and that the three hardwood plantation types generally outperformed oil palm in richness and diversity metrics. Despite this, oil palm supported high abundance of several common and widespread species also experiencing range-wide population declines and may therefore play an important role in conserving common species. Mature secondary forest hosted low abundance and diversity of the full migratory community, but high abundance and richness of conservation priority migrants along with native hardwood and teak plantations. Likewise, the percentage of forest cover on the landscape was positively associated with priority migrant abundance and richness but negatively associated with the abundance of migrants in general, highlighting how individual species within the broad group of Neotropical migratory landbirds respond differently to anthropogenic changes in land use. Across all cover types, the retention of tall overstory trees increased the abundance, richness, and diversity of all migrants, which indicates that vertical structural diversity and remnant trees are important habitat features for birds in agricultural landscapes. Our findings show that conservation opportunities exist in hardwood and oil palm plantations, though the species likely to benefit from conservation action will vary among plantation types. For the subset of conservation priority migrants, our results suggest that conservation efforts should combine strategies that retain and restore secondary forest, promote the adoption of native hardwood and teak plantations, and promote the retention of tall, remnant trees in agricultural landscapes.","Mangroves (stretch of intertidal tropical and subtropical forests between inland coastal forests and the sea) are being exploited at a rate that is unprecedented, there is loss of biodiversity because of conflicting and unsuitable uses. This study was aimed at promoting the protection of mangrove and associated coastal forests within Tiko and Limbe III municipalities in south western Cameroon, Central Africa via the contribution of buffer zone agroforestry. Representative traditionally dominant agricultural land use sites were surveyed for the identification and analysis of farming practices using participatory rapid appraisal (PRA). Data collected (qualitative and quantitative) were subjected to descriptive and inferential statistics. Out of twelve (12) agroforestry practices currently carried out by farmers under three widely dominant classic agroforestry systems (agri-silvicultural – plantation and non-plantation, silvo-pastoral and agri-silvo-pastoral systems), 5 of them under plantation and non-plantation systems (palms on crops lands, cocoa-based, rubber on crop lands, scattered trees on farmland and home gardens) were considered climate smart agroforestry practices. The maximum diameter, density, height and crown diameter of trees were dominant in the cocoa-based except for the mango-based which had the maximum tree height. The tree size class for poles (≥10cm to <30cm) was dominant in the 5 practices. For a more inclusive green economy and climate smart agriculture, some improvements on tree density, shade management and choice of multi-purpose trees species (Cedrela sepium, Moringa oleifera, Leucaena leucocephala and fruit trees) for vital functions such as firewood, soil improvement, medicine, food and construction are advocated to enhance sustainable exploitation of adjacent coastal forests thus protecting mangrove. Moreover, on account of resultant stable tree species, structural and use diversity of adjacent coastal forests, further make buffer agroforestry to hold promise for the conservation of fragile and vulnerable mangroves. There is therefore also need to expand the present study in other mangrove areas especially the mangroves of Cameroon Estuary which is the major deforestation hotspot in Cameroon.",23.9366782010881,4,"tropic, habitat, field"

However, deforestation activities for various purposes, among them, agriculture and settlement, have continued to remove unknown quantities of biomass and carbon stocks across tropical forests of Africa. This study was conducted to estimate aboveground tree biomass (AGB), carbon stocks (AGCS) and carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2 e) among three vegetation cover types (wooded land, bushland and grassland) found in Mapfungautsi forest and to quantify the long-term estimated total AGB, AGCS and CO2 e lost due to deforestation activities in the forest (between the year 2000 and 2020). Data collection was conducted using remote sensing imagery, field measurements and an allometric equation. A total of 22 plots, each measuring 50m x50m were established across the three vegetation cover types where tree height, diameter at breast height, number of stems/ha and regeneration were measured. The collected data was analysed using EViews Version 10 software. Wooded land generally had the highest values across all the four tree growth variables followed by bushland and grassland. The average estimated AGB stored were 50.78t/ha, 14.7t/ha and 8.2 t/ha for wooded land, bushland and grassland respectively. From the 10632ha cleared over 20 years, losses amounting to an estimated mean total AGB, AGCS and CO2 e of 387669.53t, 182205.09t and 668692.69t respectively were observed. We conclude that quantifying and raising awareness about the lost AGB, AGCS and CO2 e among stakeholders will lead to the implementation of remedial action to replenish the lost biomass and carbon stocks.","To contribute to the development of methods for the sustainable management of forest ecosystems in Central Africa, the following research question was addressed: can analyses of land cover change help to understand and document the spatial organization and mechanisms of forest degradation? To answer this question in the Democratic Republic of Congo, the Makala project mapped the tree and forest resources of Kinshasa's wood-fuel supply basin and attempted to predict how they would evolve in the future. Maps were made for four periods (1984, 2001, 2006 and 2012) using a mosaic of four LANDSAT images. The above-ground biomass was estimated in 2012 using forest inventories in 317 plots distributed across the four types of plant cover found on the Bateke plateau (4,337 trees and 44 species were recorded). This inventory data combined with the satellite data allowed us to make the first comprehensive assessment of above-ground biomass in the study area. Between 2000 and 2012, the average volume of wood-fuel fell by more than 50%. Over the entire period studied (1984 to 2012), carbon stocks fell by 75%. In the wood-fuel supply area for Kinshasa, the drastic loss of forest cover, shortened fallow periods, savannah encroachment and the decline of biomass and carbon stocks are clear signals of degradation. However, these initial estimations were derived from a small sample that was extrapolated to the entire supply area. It would be very useful to increase sampling in order to obtain more accurate and realistic figures. The experience of the Makala project clearly shows that the analysis of land cover change helps to understand and document the spatial organization and mechanisms of forest degradation. However, only with a sound wood-fuel resource policy and sustainable community land management, combined with very dynamic tree reintroduction on agricultural land, will it be possible to initiate a sustainable process of restoration. (Resume d'auteur)","A multitemporal dataset of medium-resolution imagery was used to document a tree cover loss process in three forest reserves of Zambia. This degradation process was attributed to charcoal production with a high degree of certainty, as evidence of kiln scars was found in more than 85% of sites sampled with high-resolution imagery across the study areas. The spatial and temporal pattern of mapped kiln scars exposed an intense and fast-paced degradation process, with kiln densities reaching 2.3 kiln/ha, removal of about 79.3% of the aboveground biomass and reductions of 74.2% of tree cover. The analysis revealed that this forest degradation process progressively moves further away from urban centers. In the year 2010, charcoal production took place around 190 km away from Lusaka, whereas extraction areas in 2020 were located around 350 km from this city. These results underline the negative impact of charcoal production on forest resources and question its characterization as localized and periurban. The post-disturbance LCLUC trajectories of degraded woodlands in forest reserves revealed a partial conversion to agricultural land over time, with less than 25% of these woodlands cultivated seven years after charcoal production. The disaggregation of the supply sources of charcoal for the city of Lusaka based on consumption figures and remote sensing deforestation records showed that the charcoal generated as a byproduct of agricultural expansion is not enough to meet the annual charcoal demand of Lusaka. On the contrary, the majority (65%) of this charcoal is the result of a forest degradation process that alters 197.4 km2 of miombo woodlands annually. These findings highlight the role of charcoal production as a direct driver of forest degradation and suggest that forest degradation resulting from charcoal production has surpassed deforestation due to agricultural expansion as the main tree cover loss process in Zambia. These results provide data-driven evidence to improve the characterization of forest degradation resulting from charcoal production across the woodlands of southern Africa and aid the REDD + monitoring, reporting and verification systems in compliance with international reporting commitments.","To contribute to the development of meth- ods for the sustainable management of forest ecosystems in Central Africa, the fol- lowing research question was addressed: can analyses of land cover change help to understand and document the spatial or- ganization and mechanisms of forest degra- dation?

The study was carried out using Remote Sensing and Geographic Information System (GIS), focusing on analysis of Landsat 5 ETM and Landsat 8 ORI/TIRS satellite images. The classification was conducted for the following distinct classes; closed forest, open forest, shrubland, savanna grassland, agriculture fields, and water. The analysis revealed that closed forest diminished from 19% in 1997 to 10% in 2007 to 6% in 2017. Open forest reduced from 30% to 21% from 1997 to 2007 but increased to 22% in 2017. Agriculture area almost doubled from 37% in 1997 to 64% in 2017. The actual area from 1997 to 2017, shows that closed forest has reduced from 7,000 ha to 3,000 ha while open forest from 12,900 ha to 7800 ha. Savanna grassland has doubled from 5,900 ha to 13,000 ha. However, future studies should use modern satellites such as Sentinel and Landsat 9 for improved quantification of changes. The findings show that even the protected forest reserve (previously dominated by closed forest) is not fully protected from deforestation by local communities. Government and other stakeholders should devise measures to meet the needs of the surrounding communities and the ecological/biophysical needs of the reserves. Based on this study, issues of re-demarcation of the forest reserve and the accessed area should also be explored. This study serves as a reference for the management of Thuma Forest Reserve as a refuge for natural tree species, rivers that harbour endemic fish species (Opsaridium microlepis and Opsaridium microcephalis) and the sustainable management of endangered elephants in the reserve.","Reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation, and enhancing carbon stocks (REDD+) is a crucial component of global climate change mitigation. Remote sensing can provide continuous and spatially explicit above-ground biomass (AGB) estimates, which can be valuable for the quantification of carbon stocks and emission factors (EFs). Unfortunately, there is little information on the fate of the land following tropical deforestation and of the associated carbon stock. This study quantified post-deforestation land use across the tropics for the period 1990–2000. This dataset was then combined with a pan-tropical AGB map at 30 m resolution to refine EFs from forest conversion by matching deforestation areas with their carbon stock before and after clearing and to assess spatial dynamics of EFs by follow-up land use. In Latin America, pasture was the most common follow-up land use (72%), with large-scale cropland (11%) a distant second. In Africa deforestation was often followed by small-scale cropping (61%) with a smaller role for pasture (15%). In Asia, small-scale cropland was the dominant agricultural follow-up land use (35%), closely followed by tree crops (28%). Deforestation often occurred in forests with lower than average carbon stocks. EFs showed high spatial variation within eco-zones and countries. While our EFs are only representative for the studied time period, our results show that EFs are mainly determined by the initial forest carbon stock. The estimates of the fraction of carbon lost were less dependent on initial forest biomass, which offers opportunities for REDD+ countries to use these fractions in combination with recent good quality national forest biomass maps or inventory data to quantify emissions from specific forest conversions. Our study highlights that the co-location of data on forest loss, biomass and fate of the land provides more insight into the spatial dynamics of land-use change and can help in attributing carbon emissions to human activities.","This study is focused on land use and land cover dynamics observed in Central River Region. It aims to determine the direction and rate of change in land use as a means of assessing the impact of climate change in Central River Region (CRR) of The Gambia. Decadal satellite images were used to measure changes in land use and land cover from 1984 to 2017 using supervised classification. Eight land use and land cover types were identified and mapped in this study namely: Crop lands, Gambia River, Halophytic vegetation, Irrigated crops, Mangrove, Settlement, Shrub/Wood savanna and Wooded savanna. The areas of crop lands, halophytic vegetation and settlement expanded between 1984 and 2017. River Gambia, irrigated crops, mangrove, shrub/wood savanna and wooded savanna areas decreased during the same period. Transition to less savanna was higher than transition to more settlement. In addition, physicochemical parameters were analyzed during the rainy and dry seasons for correlation with climate data. Socioeconomic surveys based on structured questionnaires were also conducted with 70 households in 6 villages in CRR. Land clearing for agriculture, tree cutting for firewood and charcoal, settlement and livestock grazing were mainly cited by the respondents as the main culprit inducing land cover change in CRR. This study shows that deforestation and forest degradation are still in progress despite the implementation of a management plan for a full rotation. We therefore proposed best management practices in order to control the agricultural clearing of land in the region such as agricultural intensification and soil fertility improvement.","Spatial time-series measurements of forest degradation rates are important for estimating national greenhouse gas emissions but have been challenging for open forests and woodlands. This lack of quantitative data on forest degradation rates, location and biomass is an important constraint to developing national REDD+ policy. In Malawi, and in most countries in Africa, most assessments of forest cover change for carbon emissions monitoring tend to report only deforestation in the public forest estate managed by the government, even when important forest degradation also occurs in agricultural areas, such as customary forests and other tree-based systems. This study has resulted in: (a) a new robust forest map for Malawi, (b) spatial and quantitative measurements of both forest degradation and deforestation, and (c) a demonstration of the approach through the introduction of a tool that maps across the broad landscape of forests and trees outside of forests. The results can be used to support REDD+ National Forest Monitoring Systems. This analysis produces new estimates of landscape-wide deforestation rates between 2000–2009 (22,410 ha yr−1) and 2009–2015 (38,937 ha yr−1). We further produce new estimates of the rate of forest degradation between 2000–2009 (42,961 ha yr−1) and 2009–2015 (71,878 ha yr−1). The contribution of these new tools and estimates to capacities for calculating carbon emissions are important, increasing prospects for full REDD+ readiness across semi-arid Africa.","Deforestation contributes to global greenhouse gas emissions and must be reduced if the 1.5°C limit to global warming is to be realized. Protected areas represent one intervention for decreasing forest loss and aiding conservation efforts, yet there is intense human pressure on at least one-third of protected areas globally. There have been numerous studies addressing the extent and identifying drivers of deforestation at the local, regional, and global level. Yet few have focused on drivers of deforestation in protected areas in high thematic detail. Here we use a new crowdsourced data set on drivers of tropical forest loss for the period 2008–2019, which has been collected using the Geo-Wiki crowdsourcing application for visual interpretation of very high-resolution imagery by volunteers. Extending on the published data on tree cover and forest loss from the Global Forest Change initiative, we investigate the dominant drivers of deforestation in tropical protected areas situated within 30° north and south of the equator. We find the deforestation rate in protected areas to be lower than the continental average for the Latin Americas (3.4% in protected areas compared to 5.4%) and Africa (3.3% compared to 3.9%), but it exceeds that of unprotected land in Asia (8.5% compared to 8.1%). Consistent with findings from foregoing studies, we also find that pastures and other subsistence agriculture are the dominant deforestation driver in the Latin Americas, while forest management, oil palm, shifting cultivation and other subsistence agriculture dominate in Asia, and shifting cultivation and other subsistence agriculture is the main driver in Africa. However, we find contrasting results in relation to the degree of protection, which indicate that the rate of deforestation in Latin America and Africa in strictly protected areas might even exceed that of areas with no strict protection. This crucial finding highlights the need for further studies based on a bottom up crowdsourced, data collection approach, to investigate drivers of deforestation both inside and outside protected areas.","This paper examined the dynamics of land use changes on the livelihood of the local communities in Baringo County. Land is a principal factor of production, a source of life and livelihoods. It provides a means of living and a variety of uses such as agricultural, human settlement, environmental conservation, urban and industrial development purposes among others. These uses compete for space in a fixed area, hence the rising land use conflicts and degradation. The situation has threatened lives and livelihoods, making it difficult to plan for the livelihood activities in the County. This is happening against the backdrop of land use policy changes including; sessional paper no 3 of 2009 on the National Land Policy, the Constitution of Kenya 2010, the Land Act, 2012, the Land Registration Act, 2012, the Community Land Act, 2016 and sessional paper no 1 of 2017 on National Land Use Policy that were intended to alleviate the situation. This situation is now a major threat to the livelihood of the local communities in Baringo County. This study, therefore, sought to examined the dynamics of land use changes on the livelihood of the local communities in Baringo county with specific objective to establish the drivers of the changes. A comprehensive desk review of existing literature was done, and land use changes were descriptively analyzed. The review spanned from pre-colonial (before 1895), colonial (1895 to 1963), independence (1963 to 2010) including the subsequent years of land reforms following the promulgation of the Constitution of Kenya 2010 onwards to 2020. The study found that the key drivers of land use changes originate from the change of land use policies from customary to European-like systems during the colonial era (1895 to 1963). These drivers revolve around the conflicts in the application of land use policies and laws, dual production system (different land use for registered private land in arable areas and the unregistered community land in non-arable areas within the county) occasioning wide productivity gap and economic disparity. Further the knowledge gaps associated with colonial perceptions, ideologies, and attitudinal International Journal of Academic Research in Business and Social Sciences Vol. 1 1 , No. 9, 2021, E-ISSN: 2222-6990 © 2021 HRMARS 562 practices, which led to misconception and wrong policies aggravated the situation. The consequences disorganize the local community land use and social system, broke down the traditional grazing and cropping patterns, depleted soils fertility & degraded the environment. In addition, the study found out that in the unregistered community land, land use conflicts were rampant, and characterized by invaded and claim interest as well as unscrupulous legal manipulation of land ownership records leading to dispossession. These two salient features are the main drivers of land use changes that led to continuous and frequent fatal inter-ethnic land use conflicts among the local communities; causing displacement and destruction of property among other atrocities working against politically weak local community. This scenario destabilized livelihood possibilities making it difficult for local communities to engage in basic livelihood activities and create uncertainty for future development. The study concluded that the security of land tenure perpetrates land use conflicts particularly in the unregistered community land. The government, therefore, need to register the community land to enhance land tenure security in the county. Background of the Study The background of the study covers introduction, problem statement, objectives Introduction Globally, land resource is the basis of human livelihood, since it provides basic needs such as food, water, energy, clothing and shelter. It allows for a variety of uses including agricultural production, human settlement and environmental conservation to preserve it for posterity, and can satisfy a diverse range of local communities’ livelihood objectives. All these uses of land resource compete for space in a fixed land area within an ever-changing environment. In addition, it is a finite resource and increasingly becoming scarce over time. The ensuing competition and growing forces at work necessitates government intervention through land use policy in order to harmonize the various uses. Moreover, in practice, it is difficult to arrive to an equilibrium between the various uses without an external force. Therefore, the unfolding scenario leads to land use changes problems, which calls for government intervention through land use policies. Land use policy is intended to balance users demands, facilitate production and sustain livelihood for the local communities and at same time guarantee political stability. In this study, dynamics of land use changes is defined as policy changes and the resultant consequences. In Africa, dynamics of land use changes evolved through various transformations associated with government policies adopted by different political regimes. The changes were traced from the precolonial, colonial and post-colonial eras. Each of these eras introduced changes in land use policies that shape up different social, economic and political realities on the livelihood of the local communities. Livelihood is defined as comprising the capabilities, assets (including both material and social resources) and activities required for a means of living by the local communities (Scones, 2008). Livelihood is sustainable when it can cope with the policy changes, and recover from, stresses and shocks arising from it, maintain or enhance local communities’ capabilities, assets and activities, while not undermining the natural resources base. In this case, land resource represents the natural resource base, and the capacity of the local communities to use it to generate and maintain their means of living, enhance their well-being and preserve it for future generations is dependent on policy changes. These changes influence greatly the livelihood outcomes of the local communities. International Journal of Academic Research in Business and Social Sciences Vol. 1 1 , No. 9, 2021, E-ISSN: 2222-6990 © 2021 HRMARS 563 In this respect, local communities are indigenous populations who reside and derive their livelihood from land resource. They consider land resource as the principal factor of production and the source of livelihood because it provides basic needs such as food, water, energy, clothing and shelter. Land resource also allows for a variety of uses including agricultural, human settlement and environmental conservation that satisfy a diverse range of livelihood objectives for local communities. In Kenya, dynamics of land use changes emanates largely from colonial regime actions and policies, which continued in slightly modified manner after independence (Thuo, 2013). Before the colonial era (before 1895), land use was managed through African local communities’ customary laws. Land use and management practices were guided and controlled by established regulations and procedures among various local communities (Thuo, 2013). Land use was organized into specific areas of agricultural (crops and livestock), human settlement, environmental conservation uses and heritage sites, among others. Most of the land resource was owned by the entire community while individual community members had only user rights (Thuo, 2013). The land use was communal, small-scale subsistence in nature, stable and sustainable in terms of provision for local communities’ livelihood and environmental conservation needs. The period depicts a close economy without government intervention in terms of land use policy changes. Local communities enjoy territorial niches with boundaries defined by specific geographical and physical features such as rivers, mountains, trees, and valleys. The ethnic community chiefs, assisted by the Council of elders, had the power to make land use decisions. Land use was assumed to operate in a dynamic equilibrium checked by raids and natural disasters such as war, disease outbreaks, earthquakes and famines. Soil fertility was maintained through shift cultivation with adequate fallow periods of three (3) years or more required to restore soil structure and fertility. Much of the uncultivated land was used as pastoral communities grazing areas. Forested areas were used for hunting, trapping and honey gathering. Periodic droughts checked Land use and inter communities’ raids to maintain the dynamic equilibrium. During colonial era(1895 to 1963), the colonial government took over the control of land use from the local communities through violence, trickery, and mutual agreements (Thuo, 2013). It dismantled the ethnic community territorial niches and nationalized land use. All land in Kenya became Crown Land. All local communities were dispossessed, and customary land use laws by the local communities were rendered redundant. All existing land use rights by the local communities were at the mercy of the colonial power (Okoth-Ogendo, 1995). Therefore, the genesis of land use problems in Kenya. Fundamentally, the land use policy changes were biased and oriented to benefit European settlers with scant attention to local communities. The land use policies created a dual land use system where the European colonists occupy the high rainfall and fertile areas, employing modern land use practices based on individuals’ decisions. At the same time, the local communities were restricted to native reserves in the drier regions, where local communities were allowed to continue with collective land use decisions. These land use changes promoted economic disparity between European settler and local communities during colonial era. Land use policies promoted high productivity land use practices for European white farmers, while encouraging low productivity traditional land use practices for local communities.

The results indicate that the availability of water, fuel-wood and fodder decreased, agricultural production declined and livelihood opportunities were reduced mainly due to depletion of natural resources. Consequently, the male out-migration increased by 15% during 1981–2011. This increased workload of women by 25%, more than 40% women are under severe threat of a variety of health risks generated mainly due to excess work-load, under-nourishment and lack of hygiene and sanitation. Key-words: Primary resource developers, ecosystem services, climate change, food and livelihood security, sanitation and health, sustainable development, India, Himalayas. 78 P. C. Tiwari • B. Joshi members of the family (Maithani 1996). On the other hand, there is severe shortage of adult male labour to work in agriculture and other sectors of rural economy which further acts as a drag on agricultural productivity and retards the process of socio-economic development in the mountains. The cumulative impact of all these physical, socio-economic and cultural constraints in the mountains is leading to grinding poverty, hardship, constant fear of insecurity, a feeling of helplessness, and complete dependence on the outside help. The environment thus created is not conducive to attaining the goals of sustainable mountain development (Maithani 1996; Joshi and Tiwari 2013). During the recent past a variety of changes has emerged in traditional resource utilization pattern mainly in response to the population growth and resultant increased demand of natural resources, and to the global change, particularly economic globalisation, urbanization and climate change in the Himalayas (IOM 2008; Jain and Nagarwalla 2004; Tiwari and Joshi 2012a). Women experience these changes differently and disproportionately and respond to them in a varying manner because of socially constructed gender relations and environmental sensitivity of mountain ecosystems. They make use of their critical traditional knowledge of and experience with natural resource management and adapting agricultural and food systems to multiple drivers of environmental change, including climate change, globalisation and economic processes, out-migration, and land-use changes in mountain environments, which helped women to become an important agent of sustainable mountain development (ICIMOD 2011). However, these changes have exerted sharply accentuated pressures on local economy through depletion of land, water, biodiversity and forests resources, collapsing conventional production system and increasing community vulnerability to livelihood and food insecurity and increased risks of natural disasters (World Bank 2009; Lonergan 1998). This has augmented male out-migration, and consequently increased hardships of rural women and deteriorated their quality of life (Mamgain 2003; Tiwari and Joshi 2012b). Conceptual Background Mountains have long been marginalized from the view point of sustainable development of their resources and inhabitants. However, during the recent years our understanding about the problems of mountain regions and approach to their development has undergone drastic changes (ICIMOD 2010). This is reflected by a deepening anxiety over the depletion of natural resources and disruption of mountain ecosystem services. As a result, the significance of mountain social-ecological systems was acknowledged for the first time on a global scale in Agenda 21 of the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED), held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in 1992 (UN 2012). Mountains include some of the most fragile ecosystems on the planet (ICIMOD 2010) as they are highly sensitive to changes caused by natural as well as anthropogenic factors (Sonesson and Messerli 2002). The drivers of changes range from a variety on natural hazards and disasters to a series of human-induced processes such as population growth, depletion of natural resources, urbanization, economic globalisation and resultant intensification of land use (Tiwari 2000; ICIMOD 2011). Moreover, changing climatic conditions have put pressure on the mountain environments through higher mean annual temperatures and melting of glaciers and snow, altered precipitation patterns, and more frequent and extreme weather events 79 Environmental Changes, Rural Out-migration and Social Dynamics in Himalayas which are likely to intensify the impacts of other natural as well as socio-economic drivers of change (IPCC 2007; UNEP-WCMC 2002; CIDA 2002; Brody et al. 2008; Daley 2011). Subsistence agriculture, livestock raising and income generation through small scale trade, and wage and casual labour constitute the main source of livelihood of mountain communities (Leduc and Shrestha 2008). The Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) of the United Nations has identified more than 75% of the land surface of the world’s mountain as unsuitable or marginally suitable for agriculture (Huddleston and Ataman 2003; Messerli and Ives 1997; IFAD 2001). It has been observed that the proportion of poor and vulnerable people increases with elevation (Huddleston and Ataman 2003). There are indications that poverty inequality between mountain people and those living in other areas is currently increasing (ICIMOD 2010). Approximately, 271 million people, which accounts for nearly 40% of the mountain population in developing and transition countries, have been estimated to be highly vulnerable to food insecurity, specifically in Asia and Latin America (Huddleston and Ataman 2003; FAO 2008). High dependency on natural resources and increasing marginalisation are some of important factors for prevailing poverty, food and livelihood insecurity and poor community health, in mountains of developing countries which are further increasing their vulnerability to long-term impacts of global environmental changes (Huddleston and Ataman 2003). The globalizing economy has both positive as well as negative impacts on the mountain livelihoods and economy. The fast growing tourism industry in India, China and Nepal has opened new opportunities for the growth of mountain economy. Furthermore, China and India are the fastest growing economies in Asia, yet, they have the highest poverty ratios. Moreover, the economic globalisation have further increased the vulnerability of the mountain communities to the environmental risks through exploitation of natural resources even in remote and inaccessible areas, particularly in the developing countries. This seems to have further deepened poverty imbalances between highlands and lowlands (Hassan et al. 2005; Huddleston and Ataman 2003). However, for millennia the mountain communities were developing distinctive mechanisms to adapt to these typical conditions through evolving a range of adaptive measures (UNEP 2004; ICIMOD 2010). Migration of male youth is one the important adaptive measures to constraints of subsistence economy and changing environmental conditions and associated natural and socio-economic risks across all the mountain regions of the world (Sherpa 2007). On one hand, labour migration improves economic conditions and ensures food security in terms of remittance (Kollmair et al. 2006); on the other hand, it has inadvertently created a vacuum in the mountain societies, putting extra responsibilities on women (Sherpa 2007). During 1991–2000, the level of adult male out-migration in the mountainous regions of South Asia exceeded 40% (Rasmussen and Parvez 2002). Draining away of productive human resource from mountains has serious implications not only for the economic development, but also for the enrichment of socio-cultural life in the region (Maithani 1996). Women, being natural resource developers, possess undocumented indigenous knowledge, and their contribution towards preserving the mountain cultures and natural resources is highly significant (ICIMOD 1999). However, the depletion of natural resource base has affected women adversely by increasing their workload and marginality (UNDP 2010). As a result, women play crucial role in mountain societies as major work force in food production system and as key players in the conservation and management of natural re80 P. C. Tiwari • B. Joshi sources and environments (FAO 2010, 2011). Globally, women share is nearly 43% of the work force in agricultural sector, and mountain regions of Asia, Africa, and Latin America it is above 50% (Sherpa 2007). The combined hardship and adversity of mountain living conditions trained the women to respond radically to the forces that were exploiting their natural resources and undermining their livelihoods. Rural women’s active participation in the conservation and management of their natural resources laid the foundation for the well known environmental movements in the seventies (Verma 2001). The famous 'Chipko Movement' (hugging the trees movement) of Uttarakhand – a distinctly non-violent grassroots movement – was organized and lead by illiterate rural women against the exploitative state forestry policy in 1970s. However, women in the Himalayas are particularly vulnerable to the impacts of environmental changes due to skewed power relations and inequitable cultural and social norms, as a result, they are often disadvantaged in terms of power relations and accessing resources, and exposed to increased risks associated with environmental changes (ICIMOD 2010). These risks include further marginalization, exclusion from decision-making and dislocation from access to resources for survival. Women generally have far less access to and control over the resources they manage and conserve (Sherpa 2007). The women of the Hindu Kush Himalayas of Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, China","Climate change will challenge the resilience of both agriculture-based livelihoods and natural resource management regimes in East Africa in myriad ways. A major challenge is to reduce the vulnerability of people and climate-sensitive sectors, including water, agriculture, and energy, to today?s climate variability and to ensure that future development activities are appropriate to future climate contexts. Through an Ecosystem-based Adaptation (EbA) research approach this project will help to inform rural stakeholders and national policy makers in East Africa regarding the sustainability of different local and national adaptation strategies. The research approaches will integrate a review of the climate change adaptation policy contexts with local level analyses of stakeholder vulnerability, and roles of forest and tree-based ecosystem services in promoting resilience of agriculture production. Based on these research outputs a participatory approach will be used to develop effective adaptation strategies targeted at different local and national stakeholder groups. This research project will target select communities on the Kenyan and Ugandan slopes of Mt. Elgon, known as one of the five water towers of Kenya. This project will be led by the Center for International Forestry Research (CIFOR). The research team conducting this project comprises two international centers of scientific excellence focussed specifically on forestry and agroforestry-science (CIFOR and the World Agroforestry Center), with one institution in Uganda (Makerere University) and one in Kenya (KEFRI) and that have led the development of long-term studies on forest based governance and livelihoods in their respective countries. Together, this group of institutions assembles leading scientists in their respective fields, providing this project with expertise in climate and ecosystem modelling, analysis of vulnerability and governance institutions, understandings of national and sub-national policy debates around climate change adaptation, and both the knowledge of research contexts and stakeholder rapport at sub-/national levels needed to ensure successful research and policy maker engagement. This project represents a continuation of the Rockefeller Foundation?s commitment to facilitating the development of East African excellence in research around climate change issues. This collaboration between CIFOR and the World Agroforestry Center is also consistent with the new realignment of Consultative Group for International Agricultural Research (CGIAR) research efforts, specifically through the development of the CGIAR Research Program 6 (CRP6) entitled: Forests, Trees and Agroforestry: Livelihoods, Landscapes and Governance.","A relação entre água, energia e alimento é um tema que tem recebido atenção no meio acadêmico. Diante da escassez dos recursos naturais, da degradação que tem ocorrido não somente no Brasil, mas no mundo todo, os recursos naturais têm sérios riscos de esgotarem. E há que se pensar em uma gestão que possibilite a recuperação do meio ambiente de forma eficiente e sustentável. Compreendendo que o debate de nexo envolve um conjunto de inter-relações entre os recursos naturais utilizados como insumo para os serviços básicos da vida humana, neste sentido, a presente pesquisa objetivou analisar se há possibilidade de integrar a floresta ao nexo água-energia-alimentos, com vistas a não comprometer as demandas futuras e como isso pode contribuir para alcançar os Objetivos de Desenvolvimento Sustentável (ODS). Os objetivos específicos são identificar a interligação entre água, energia, alimento e floresta; apontar a necessidade de integrar a floresta ao nexo tradicional visando alcançar um desenvolvimento mais sustentável e controlar, prevenir as consequências dos impactos ambientais. A metodologia da revisão literária ocorreu com o levantamento por termos previamente identificados nas bases de dados Scopus, Web of Science e Periódico Capes, sendo a pesquisa classificada com abordagem qualitativa e método dedutivo. Os resultados apontaram que a floresta possui relação direta com os elementos água-energia-alimentos, sendo possível contribuir com as seguranças hídrica, energética e alimentar. Concluiu-se que vincular as florestas ao nexo existente, proporcionará uma maior preocupação para garantir a sustentabilidade e o equilíbrio ambiental.   Referências ALROY, John.

Relação entre a disponibilidade hídri","The article examines the perspectives of summit diplomacy in relations between Russia and the countries of the African region. Summit diplomacy in the context of this article can be considered as an integral part of multi-vector network diplomacy, which is an effective addition, and sometimes an alternative to traditional diplomacy, despite the fact that officials also take part in the summits. The authors note that in studies on the diplomacy of summits, insufficient attention is paid to the substantive aspects of the relations between their participants. Thus, the summits imply consideration of a wide range of tasks, including those of a domestic political nature. At the same time, as an instrument of foreign policy, the effectiveness of summit diplomacy depends not only on the structural characteristics of relations, but also on the dynamics of interaction between the participants. The countries of the African region have rich mineral deposits, vast areas that could potentially be suitable for highly productive agriculture; forests, including the most valuable species of trees, as well as a huge population, which can become the basis for one of the world's largest markets for goods and services. It is African countries that occupy the first places in terms of GDP growth prospects and the rapidly growing economy as a whole. Transnational corporations have long been fighting for control over resources, access to cheap labor and the population's money, increasing their presence on the continent. In this regard, Africa has become the object of special attention of leading international players, including Russia. Thus, at present, a certain return of Russia's real interest in Africa is being ascertained. In the first part of the article, the authors analyze the economic opportunities of Russia and its main interests in relations with the countries of the African region. The second part deals with the development of Africa and the negotiating agenda of African states. The third part deals with new points of growth and promising areas of interaction between Russia and Africa.","This article sets out to unravel aspects of environmental changes in the Upper Tana during the second millennium AD. This aspect has not been adequately addressed in the Upper Tana. This makes it clear that a lacuna exists in the study of communities of the Upper Tana and the way they interact with their environment in the past and present times. The objective of this article is to evaluate the relationship between human activities and environmental change in the Upper Tana from AD 1000 to 1950. It is hypothesized that the advent of iron technology and its attendant economic activities led to the depletion of indigenous forests and the general environmental degradation. The article has employed archaeological, ethnographic, oral and historical methodologies to gather data on vegetation change in the Upper Tana and other related regions.  The article, argues that livestock grazing, iron smelting, slush and burn agriculture, and the clearing of forests for housing are key contributors to vegetation change in the Upper Tana.  Results from oral reconstruction of the past vegetation of the area, and using the plant succession theory, shows that the lowland area of the Upper Tana is actually savanna with scattered trees probably inhabited by grazers. It is posited that the above factors, together with persistent droughts have altered the vegetation cover of the area.  What we have today is colonization of less desirable stunted growth. The theory advanced here is that the vegetation change has been a result of human activities.  Overwhelmingly, results the study that the researcher carried out, showed that the causes of these changes have been socio-economically associated with the expansion of agricultural communities into the area; rather than through climatic factors. Colonisation and other forces of modernistion have also contributed to the underlying problem. The article concludes that anthropogenetic factors have greatly contributed to environmental change in the upper Tana. Certainly, environmental change is a global phenomenon that has elicited research interests due to its negative impacts on human population. It is recommended that knowledge of environmental change in the past should be used to extrapolate modern environmental challenges affecting African ecosystems.","Coffee is a very important agricultural commodity, produced in around 80 countries tropics, with an estimated 125 million people depending on it for their livelihoods in Latin America, Africa and Asia, with an annual production of around nine million tons of mung beans. Consisting of at least 125 species, the coffee genus (Rubiaceae, Ixoroideae, Coffeeae) is distributed in Africa, Madagascar, the Comoros Islands, the Mascarene Islands (La Réunion and Mauritius), tropical Asia, and Australia. Two species are economically important for the production of beverage coffee. arabica. (Arabica coffee) and. canephora. Froehner (robusta coffee). Higher quality of the drink is associated with arabica. Arabica coffee is a self-fertile tetraploid, which results in very low genetic diversity of this important crop. Coffee's genetic resources are rapidly disappearing due to various threats, such as human population pressure, leading to land conversion to agriculture, deforestation, and land degradation; low coffee prices, leading to the abandonment of coffee trees in forests and gardens in favor of other, more profitable crops; and climate change, which is causing increased pest and disease infestations, increased droughts, and unpredictable rainfall patterns. All of these factors threaten livelihoods in many coffee-producing countries. Interests in cocoa and coffee development may differ in their understanding of sustainable cocoa and coffee, their interests and their actions in advancing sustainable cocoa. This article analyzes the sustainability of cocoa and coffee at a large scale and analyzes the extent to which sustainability standards, policies, and development projects address sustainability issues and contribute to ecosystem services. This analysis is based on a literature review. Producers in the three countries and share concerns about price volatility, weak farmer organization and dependence on a few buyers. Producers in Sulawesi and the Central Region are compensating for low yields of cocoa and coffee production by diversifying cocoa and coffee systems. Public and private development actors are concerned about the low volume of production. Research so far has focused on biodiversity loss, which differs depending on the age of a country's cocoa and coffee sector. Development policies and programs in all countries have focused on expanding the cocoa and coffee sectors and increasing productivity, despite the need for smallholders for economically viable farming systems and existing market structures that yield little bargaining power for farmers. Sustainability standards have been spread unevenly and have converged on compliance criteria over time, although they differed in focus initially. Recently added business criteria and the development of sustainability standards have the potential to address smallholder concerns. Keywords: Cocoa and Coffee Beans, Sustainability Standards, Sustainable coffee and cocoa production.","Currently, ~65% of extant primate species (ca 512 species) distributed in 91 countries in the Neotropics, mainland Africa, Madagascar, South Asia and Southeast Asia are threatened with extinction and 75% have declining populations as a result of deforestation and habitat loss resulting from increasing global market demands, and land conversion for industrial agriculture, cattle production and natural resource extraction. Other pressures that negatively impact primates are unsustainable bushmeat hunting, the illegal trade of primates as pets and as body parts, expanding road networks in previously isolated areas, zoonotic disease transmission and climate change. Here we examine current and future trends in several socio-economic factors directly or indirectly affecting primates to further our understanding of the interdependent relationship between human well-being, sustainable development, and primate population persistence. We found that between 2001 and 2018 ca 191 Mha of tropical forest (30% canopy cover) were lost as a result of human activities in the five primate range regions. Forty-six percent of this loss was in the Neotropics (Mexico, Central and South America), 30% in Southeast Asia, 21% in mainland Africa, 2% in Madagascar and 1% in South Asia. Countries with the greatest losses (ca 57% of total tree cover loss) were Brazil, Indonesia, DRC, China, and Malaysia. Together these countries harbor almost 50% of all extant primate species. In 2018, the world human population was estimated at ca 8bn people, ca 60% of which were found in primate range countries. Projections to 2050 and to 2100 indicate continued rapid growth of the human populations in these five primate range regions, with Africa surpassing all the other regions and totaling ca 4bn people by the year 2100. Socioeconomic indicators show that, compared to developed nations, most primate range countries are characterized by high levels of poverty and income inequality, low human development, low food security, high levels of corruption and weak governance. Models of Shared Socioeconomic Pathway scenarios (SSPs) projected to 2050 and 2100 showed that whereas practices of increasing inequality (SSP4) or unconstrained growth in economic output and energy use (SSP5) are projected to have dire consequences for human well-being and primate survivorship, practices of sustainability-focused growth and equality (SSP1) are expected to have a positive effect on maintaining biodiversity, protecting environments, and improving the human condition. These results stress that improving the well-being, health, and security of the current and future human populations in primate range countries are of paramount importance if we are to move forward with effective policies to protect the world’s primate species and promote biodiversity conservation.","Genetic modification has gotten a hostile reception from activists who claim to be protecting the planet. But the most powerful underlying emotion for their unreasoned fear—rapid human population growth—is rapidly becoming irrelevant. Will biotechnology overcrowd the planet by saving more sick people while producing more food to fuel more population growth? In a word, no. The opposition of the eco-activists is ironic, at least. Without the Green Revolution's high-yield farming, the world would already have had to clear most or all of its 16 million square miles of forests to produce today's food supply. Plant breeding, chemical fertilizers, irrigation pumps, and pesticides have been the key technologies to date in “growing more food per acre to leave more room for nature.” But each of these advances in farming has been pilloried by activist groups who claim to fear insect-protected cotton (that helps prevent devastation of the textile-dependent economies in China and India), vitamin-A-enriched “golden” rice (to prevent blindness in poor Asian children), and blight-resistant potatoes (that could prevent a re-enactment of the Irish potato famine in potato-dependent Bangladesh). Why are these people not joyful about the conservation benefits of high-yield farming? Apparently because they fear growing more food will mean even larger human populations. Fearing overpopulation was understandable in the 1960s, when the Green Revolution was suddenly tripling Asian crop yields and DDT began preventing millions of malaria deaths. Today, however, the world is 40 years into the first era when bigger harvests mean better nutrition for children instead of more people. The world's population surge is losing its steam, even though the number of people added each year is still near all-time highs. In a completely unexpected development, world birth rates per women have plummeted as radically as death rates in the era of modern medicine. Third world birth rates have come three-fourths of the way to stability, having dropped from 6.2 births per women in 1960 to 3.1 today. (Stability is 2.1.) This trend in birth rates is massive and unprecedented. The UN Population Division has just—again—lowered its estimate of the peak human population, this time to between 8 and 9 billions. (We are at 6.3 billions now.) Poor farmers almost always have big families, but affluent urban couples almost always have two children or less. The entire world (except Africa) is now on the path to urban affluence. Africa, eventually, will find its way along the same path. The eco-activists seem equally unaware that the UN Environmental Program's new Atlas of Biodiversity notes the world lost only half as many species (a combined 20 birds, mammals, and fish) to extinction in the last third of the 20th century as in the last third of the 19th century. Why the dramatic improvement? In the 19th century, man was clearing lots of forest to plant more low-yield crops. Today, we are raising yields and planting high-yield tree plantations for our lumber needs. Meanwhile, the World Conservation Union (IUCN) worries most about the one billion poor people living in the world's biodiversity hot spots, and trying to feed their families by hunting bushmeat and slash-and-burn farming. Only biotechnology is likely to provide new answers to the needs of these third world peasant farmers. But won't more (and more affluent) people inevitably take more resources away from nature? Again, no. Stone-age hunters had to exploit natural resources. That is why they eradicated dozens of mammal and bird species in North America, including our horses, camels, and ground sloths. Today, biotechnology can create new resources. Bacillus thuringiensis varieties are producing 80 percent more cotton per acre in India and 80 percent more corn per acre in the Philippines because they deal more effectively with the potentially ruinous tropical pests. That effectively creates more cropland. Biotechnology tomatoes can grow in far saltier water, which effectively creates new water supplies. The eco-activists propose to “solve” the food problem by subtracting resources, most notably the 80 million tons of natural nitrogen that conventional farmers take from the air each year to make “chemical” fertilizer for their crops. Organic farming, ardently promoted by the environmentalists, bans “synthetic” nitrogen. The world would need the manure from another 7 to 8 billion cattle (and 3 to 30 acres of forage per beast) to supply all-organic nitrogen today, and far more by 2050. The organic “solution” would immediately force us to clear virtually all the world's wildlands to grow clover—or doom one-third of the world's human population. Apparently, the eco-activists would like to solve the competition for land between people and wildlife by eliminating people. But in the 21st century, with rising farm productivity and rapidly declining birth rates, setting the needs of people and wildlife needlessly against each other is both inhumane and environmentally irresponsible. Genetic engineering, both in medicine and agriculture, is good for people and the planet.","The object of this research is Cattle Ranches. Cattle Ranches is the practice of raising herds of cattle on large landscape including the structures and crops of legumes, grasses or forages, devoted to the raising, and grazing of the herds. Organized animal productions have been successfully practiced for decades in developed countries, but have been of minor Agricultural consideration in arid regions and Sub-Saharan Africa. Most African herders relied on natural pasture in the tropics which are either forested with high incidences of disease and parasites detrimental to profitable animal production, or dry zone which calls for tremendous physical exertion on the animal in order to obtain feed and water. Feed shortage and low quality of available feeds are constraints for livestock production and has been a major constraint for animal production during dry periods. Therefore, farmers use different coping mechanisms ranging from purchasing of feeds from the market and destocking unproductive animals as drastic measures. The negative trend results into many pastoralists resorting to grazing in crops farm lands. The pressure from increasing population and diminishing availability of land for pastoral range practice causes farmers- herders’ clashes which results into loss of lives. Rise in the toll of farmers-herdsmen crisis and clashes across many African countries in recent years, became worst. This brings to fore, the need to set up Cattle Ranches as an alternative to nomadic agriculture. The viability of setting up ranches for Cattles using improved irrigation systems to make up for the dry zone/season condition is practicable and profitable as practiced in developed countries. Ranches provide feed from grown forage legumes and fodder trees species through irrigation, combined with appropriate postharvest handling practices. Feeds availability mitigate the constraints of food scarcity and improves livestock productivity. The study consisted of outlining design procedure for the establishment of an irrigation scheme for an improved fodder crop production as food for ranch cattle.","Agroforestry is one of the most conspicuous land use systems across landscapes and agro ecological zones in Africa. Some of the components of Agroforestry systems are; home garden agroforestry, alley cropping, forest farming, wind break, river banks, park land, crop land trees and buffer zones agroforestry practices. Climate change impacts by complex weather-related phenomena have threatened agricultural and forest ecosystems and the livelihood of agricultural and local communities. Agroforestry has an important role in climate change adaptation through diversified land-use practices, sustainable livelihoods, sources of income, enhanced forest and agricultural productivity and reduced weather-related production losses, which enhance resilience against climate impacts. Like few other land use options, agroforestry has real potential to contribute to food security, climate change mitigation and adaptation, while preserving and strengthening the environmental resource base of Africa’s rural landscapes. It has a key role to play in landscape-scale mitigation schemes under the REDD+or AFOLU (Agriculture, Forestry and other land uses) concepts. Home garden agroforestry system indicates that adaptation and mitigation to climate change will largely depend on the increased resilience of both agroforestry systems and of local management capacity. Despite less attention has been given to tree based land use option, agroforestry has played a major role in reducing household vulnerability to shocking. Smallholder farmers have already started mainstreaming tree based land use system as resilience to social needs because the poor are more exposed to change; Agroforestry is one of best risk aversion option to make them move out of food insecurity. Generally, agroforestry systems readily bundle both mitigation and adaptation strategies and provide several pathways to securing food security for poor farmers, while contributing to climate change mitigation. Agroforestry should attract more attention in global agendas on climate adaptation and mitigation because of its positive social and environmental impacts.",22.5026420110033,3,"resourc, natur, product"
