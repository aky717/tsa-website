[Methods] For the purpose of this study, elite ballerinas (n = 97) and normal female adults (n = 203) aged 18 to 39 were recruited and these participants were tested for body weight, height, body fat, fat free mass, flexibility, injury risks on the joints and gene polymorphisms (ACE, ACTN3, COL5A1 polymorphism). [Results] As results, the ACE DD genotype in ballerinas was associated with higher body fat and percentage of body fat than the ACE II and ID genotypes (p < 0.05). In the study on the ACTN3 polymorphism and ballerinas, the XX genotype in ballerinas had lower body weight and lower fat-free mass than the RR and RX genotype (p < 0.005). Also, the means of sit and reach test for flexibility was lower in the ACTN3 XX genotype of ballerinas than the RR and RX genotype of ballerinas (p < 0.05). Among the sports injuries, the ankle injury of the XX-genotyped ballerinas was in significantly more prevalence than the RR and XX-genotyped ballerinas (p < 0.05). According to the odd ratio analysis, XX-genotyped ballerinas have the injury risk on the ankle about 4.7 (95% CI: 1.6~13.4, p < 0.05) times more than the RR and RX-genotyped ballerinas. Meanwhile, the COL5A1 polymorphism in ballerinas has no association with any factors including flexibility and injury risks. [Conclusion] In conclusion, ACE polymorphism and ACTN3 polymorphism were associated with ballerinas' performance capacity; COL5A1 was not associated with any factors of performance of Ballerinas. The results suggested that the ACE DD genotype is associated with high body fat, the ACTN3 XX genotype is associated with low fat-free mass, low flexibility, and higher risk of ankle-joint injury.",https://www.e-pan.org/upload/pdf/jenb-18-2-205.pdf,

The objective of this study has been to explore the prevalence and association between ED, AM and SUM in ballet. MATERIAL AND METHODS The sample comprised 21 ballet dancers, 23.1±4.5 years old, members of the professional National Ballet Ensemble from Croatia. Variables were collected by questionnaires examining SUM, occurrence of amenorrhea, and corresponding ballet-specific and socio-demographic factors (Questionnaire on Substance Use - QSU) and the level of ED (Brief Eating Disorder in Athletes Questionnaire - BEDA-Q). RESULTS Smoking is prevalent in 40% of dancers (25% smoke on a daily basis), 36% often use analgesics, and 25% engage in binge drinking at least once a month. Smoking and binge drinking are less frequent in ballerinas with a higher academic level (r = 0.60 and r = 0.54 for binge drinking and smoking, respectively; p < 0.05). Alcohol drinking is higher among dancers who consume analgesics more often and those with a higher BEDA-Q score (r = 0.53 and r = 0.54 for analgesics and BEDA-Q, respectively; p < 0.05). Amenorrhea is more prevalent among those dancers with a higher BEDA-Q score. Women who consume nutritional supplements are less likely to use analgesics (Mann Whitney U test = 2.11; p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS Efforts seeking to prevent ED in ballet should target dancers who consume alcohol to a greater extent. Future studies should specifically explore the less frequent consumption of analgesics among dancers who consume nutritional supplements.",http://medpr.imp.lodz.pl/pdf-60718-4167?filename=Disordered eating_.pdf,

We also verified neutrophil death and ROS release. Blood samples were taken from 13 dancers before, immediately after, and 18 hours after a ballet class. The ballet class increased the plasma activities of CK-total (2.0-fold) immediately after class, while the activities of CK-cardiac muscle (1.0-fold) and LDH (3.0-fold) were observed to increase 18 hours after the class. Levels of the TNF-α, IL-1β, IgG, and IgA were not affected under the study conditions. The exercise was found to induce neutrophil apoptosis (6.0-fold) 18 hours after the ballet class. Additionally, immediately after the ballet class, the neutrophils from the ballerinas were found to be less responsive to PMA stimulus. Conclusion. Ballet class was found to result in inflammation in dancers. The inflammation caused by the ballet class remained for 18 hours after the exercise.

In recent years there has been an increase in both scientific and public interest in the ability of music to evoke vivid, emotional, and rich autobiographical memories. For example, several “viral” videos have taken the internet by storm, illustrating powerful instances of music evoking memories in individuals with dementia – perhaps the most recent example is a clip of a former ballerina with Alzheimer’s disease who recalls her dance movements at the sound of “Swan Lake.” Current scientific work in this area informs the mechanisms by which music induces emotions and provides critical evidence for assessing whether music is a uniquely effective memory cue. Research on music and autobiographical memory is also of practical relevance by informing the development of music-based interventions, for example, for people with memory disorders. The aim of this Special Collection on Music and Autobiographical Memory is to bring together contributions in this growing area of research from a diverse array of scholars and interdisciplinary perspectives. The contributions to this Special Collection investigate this topic from a variety of angles: across the lifespan in both experimental and everyday settings, in healthy and clinical populations, and using a range of quantitative, qualitative, and theoretical methodologies. The collection was also prompted by two recent and relevant symposia: a symposium on music-evoked autobiographical memories at the 2019 Society for Music Perception and Cognition conference co-chaired by the Guest Editors (Drs Belfi & Jakubowski) and Music & Lifetime Memories: An Interdisciplinary Conference (directed by Dr Jakubowski at Durham University in November 2019). Several articles within this collection grew directly out of these symposia, though the collection also covers a wider range of perspectives from researchers across the globe with expertise in music, memory, identity, emotion, and ageing. The bulk of psychological research on this topic has been conducted within the last several years, although initial investigations span the past few decades. One of the earliest explorations of music and autobiographical memory found that participants were frequently able to recall songs that evoked specific memories, and their memories tended to be of positive emotional experiences (Baumgartner, 1992). Other early work established that popular music triggers autobiographical memories of general events for both younger and older adults (Schulkind et al., 1999). With the proliferation of neuroimaging techniques, researchers later began investigating the neural underpinnings of music and autobiographical memory, suggesting a role of the medial prefrontal cortex (Ford et al., 2011; Janata, 2009). A more recent trend in the field has been to characterise differences between autobiographical memories evoked by music and other sensory cues, including pictures (Baird et al., 2018; Belfi et al., 2016, 2020), words (Zator & Katz, 2017), and television shows (Jakubowski et al., 2021). The set of articles featured in this special collection adds to this developing literature in several important ways. Below, we highlight four central themes that emerged across the body of work in this collection: youth, ageing, and reminiscence bumps; music-evoked memories in special populations; identity, relationships, and emotions; and musical qualities. For each theme we provide background context of prior work done in this area, followed by summaries of the featured papers and their key contributions to the growing field of music and autobiographical memory.",https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/20592043211047123,

Methods: A cross-sectional, mixed-method study was conducted on fourteen trained classical ballet dancers (18–30 years old). Their experiences, perceptions, and feelings regarding eating attitudes and body image concerning classical ballet were acquired through qualitative focus groups. The presence of EDs symptoms and perception and (dis)satisfaction with body image was analyzed quantitatively through self-report questionnaires. Results: Participants reported concerning eating attitudes during the focus groups, such as the regular practice of several restrictive popular diets, constant restriction of foods considered “heavy” or “fatty,” meal skipping and ignoring signs of hunger, presence of overeating episodes due to stress and anxiety, feeling guilty about breaking their usual diet, classifying foods as “good” and “bad” or “lean” and “fat,” and excluding some of those foods from their usual diets. These reports were partially reflected in the questionnaires, with 50% of the ballerinas showing bulimic symptoms indicative of an unusual eating pattern (only two of them with a significant risk index), 7.1% showing symptoms of moderate binge eating, and 14.3% symptoms of EDs in general. Additionally, when considering their bodies in the context of everyday life, participants were satisfied; however, in the “classical ballet” context, they reported feeling dissatisfied with their shape. These findings were in line with results from the Stunkard's Scale, which revealed that 50% of the sample was dissatisfied with their current body shape and 57.1% indicated that their desired body shape was a leaner figure than one they considered healthy. Conclusions: The constant practice of restrictive diets and other weight-loss strategies to achieve a leaner body were associated with symptoms of EDs and body dissatisfaction in this sample. Importantly, the questionnaires used seemed to underestimate the presence of a disordered eating pattern reported by the participants during focus groups. These data could help to inform psychological and nutritional strategies aimed at improving performance, physical and psychological well-being, and quality of life of ballet dancers.",https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnut.2021.665654/pdf,

A highly developed sense of musicality distinguished Alonso's own dancing. For the ballerina, this was more than just an element of her individual style: it was an expression of the Cuban cultural environment and a common feature among ballet dancers from that island. In addition to elucidating the physical manifestations of musicality in Alonso's dancing, this article examines how the ballerina's frequent references to music in connection to both her individual identity and the Cuban ballet aesthetics fit into a national discourse of self-representation that deems Cubans an exceptionally musical people. This analysis also problematizes the Cuban ballet's brand of musicality by underscoring the tension between its possible explanations—from being the result of the dancers' socialization into a rich Afro-Caribbean musical culture to being a stylistic element that Alonso developed through her training with foreign teachers and, in turn, transmitted to her Cuban disciples.",https://scholarworks.smith.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1004&context=dan_facpubs,

Pavlova in the choreographic miniature The Dying Swan was implemented for the first time. The article contains the solution of the problem of understanding and comprehension of all artistic components of visual characteristics of the created works, which can be used in reconstructions and modern interpretations of a choreographic performance. The main iconographic motives of The Dying Swan by different artists have been illustrated on the materials of fine art, and their comparative analysis has been given. The author aims at tracing the way the idea and mechanisms of interpretation of A. Pavlovaâ€™s role are transformed into the structure of a still image. Based on the definitions considered, specific author's solutions are analysed, and their ideological-artistic originality (features of composition construction, mise en scene lighting plot of the performance, acting nuances) is revealed about the stage representation and perception of classical choreography. In the article, a significant place is given to the work of sculpture created by A. Pavlova on a topic of The Dying Swan, which has been scarcely examined, in which the specificity of the ballerinaâ€™s performing art has been interpreted as a secondary relatively independent actor's activity and her creativity has been revealed in the format of the figurative interpretation as the individual performing interpretation of a stage of primary (author's) scenic activities. The article concludes that the presented sculptural-plastic interpretation of A. Pavlova's dance as a performer of the act is further superimposed on the interpretation of the choreographic image and manifested in the expressiveness of the movements set by the ballet-master, resulting in a new semantic variant based on the previous one.",http://spaceandculture.in/index.php/spaceandculture/article/download/368/280,

The mind changes profoundly in the course of dementias, affecting daily living and resulting in reduced quality of life. Interdisciplinary approaches are required for a holistic understanding of how the mind is affected by dementia. We here explore what such a holistic theory of dementia might look like and propose the idea of “embodied mind in motion”. The paradigm is biopsychosocial or biocultural, the theoretical anchor point is the lifeworld, and the guiding concept is “embodiment,” as body and mind are constantly in motion. Physical activity is, hence, central for the experience of health and well-being, beyond being “exercise” and “health behavior”. We discuss the embodied mind in motion referring to phenomenology, enactivism and (philosophical) anthropology. In our view, habits are embodied long-term memories and a philosophical equivalent to lifestyle. They unfold the meaningfulness of moving the body, complementing the objectifiable benefits of physical exercise. Empirical studies on “holistic activities” like hiking, yoga, music and dance illustrate improved integration into everyday life. Their meaningfulness enhances compliance and increases the preventive and even therapeutic potential. A crucial factor for this is the emotional dimension of lifestyle, exemplified by the virally popularized performance of “Swan Lake” by wheel-chair bound ex-ballerina Marta Cinta González Saldaña, suffering from Alzheimer’s disease. A number of epistemological and ontological consequences anchor “embodied movement” as a valuable principle for dementia research.",https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2023.1174424/pdf,

Certain ballet positions, if performed incorrectly or with inadequate technique, can further increase the risk of bone and soft tissue injuries. Dancing en pointe, which forces the foot and ankle into extreme plantar flexion, has been reported as the most common mechanism of injury. While these injuries occur frequently, little research has been done to understand the biomechanics of the foot and ankle in ballet. The aim of this study was to use weightbearing computed tomography (WBCT) and distance mapping to describe ankle joint mechanics in various ballet positions. Methods: This was an institutional review board approved case study analyzing five healthy professional ballerinas. WBCT scans were taken bilaterally in five different positions: a control/neutral position, first position, fifth position, plié, and relevé (en pointe). A semi-automatic software was used to segment models of all bones proximal to the first distal phalanx. Talar dome and gutter articulations were selected manually, and distances along the entire tibiofibular interface and gutter articulations were calculated using a previously published protocol. The mean syndesmosis width was calculated at 1 cm, 3 cm, and 5 cm from the tibiotalar joint. Results: Syndesmotic widening was greatest in first position at 5 cm above the tibiotalar joint (Mean: 9.39 mm). The relevé position consistently had the greatest syndesmotic narrowing at all heights along the syndesmosis. The anteromedial gutter had the largest range in regard to distance mapping, with greatest joint space width in fifth position (Mean: 4.99 mm) and narrowest joint space in plié (Mean: 2.68 mm). More specifically, in fifth position the anteromedial gutter space was 71% wider than the control position. Conclusion: This study is the first of its kind to mechanistically describe the ankle as it relates to ballet dancing. Interestingly, syndesmotic and tibiotalar joint space widening was greatest in first and fifth position, which may suggest that external rotation plays a greater contributing role in ankle instability compared to plantarflexion in ballet. Future research with larger cohorts and more WBCT stress positions is needed to comprehensively understand the foot and ankle joint mechanics in this demanding sport.",https://doi.org/10.1177/2473011424s00434,

METHODS The total of 10 recreational, 24 vocational, and 10 professional ballerinas volunteered. They were subjected to: a) lower limb-length measurements, b) power tests (vertical jump-sautés and unilateral countermovement jump-temps levé), c) dexterity tests (tendus and double battement frappes), and d) flexibility tests (lateral active and passive-développé à la seconde). RESULTS For power, regression analyses revealed negative leg-length relationships in recreational dancers (p<0.05) and positive leg-length relationships in vocational dancers (p<0.05). We also found negative relationships between leg-length and dexterity in the vocational group (p=0.01).

To achieve this, we accessed their experiences and perceptions through a semi-structured interview, to better understand the pain that is an integral part of their routines before, during and after a performance. This study is based on the discourses which emerged from a group of ten ballerinas with six or more years of training, and the method chosen to tap into the underlying meanings was Grounded Analysis or Sustained Data Analysis. The analysis of the discourses collected revealed that pursuing a dancing career involves obstacles that increase the demands felt by the ballerinas, in parallel with their desire to remain in the world of performance. Thus, it is the excessive practicing and repetitive movements which give rise to pain and injuries, which are concealed and denied so as not to impede the focus of attaining perfection. In general, the results obtained emphasize the passion for dance that involves pain as an ally to this career and force the ballerinas to varied confrontation strategies. In tandem, pain is linked to fear of injury, to the end of a career as a ballerina and the relinquishment of a dream.",http://www.scielo.br/pdf/csc/v24n5/1413-8123-csc-24-05-1657.pdf,

Following a review of current research into the use of motion-sensing cameras in therapeutic contexts, we describe the method by which a relatively low-cost motion-sensing camera was coupled with a rotatable function menu. The rotatable element of the system enabled navigation of the entire menu using only two, readily performable and distinct gestures: side-swipe for function browsing; down-swipe for function selecting. To aid acceptance amongst the target audience, people with PD (who tend to be relatively elderly), the rotatable function menu was rendered as a ballerina jewelry box, with appropriate texturing and music-box style musical accompaniment. Menu implementation employed a game engine, and a software development kit allowed direct access to the camera’s functionality, enabling gesture recognition. For example, users’ side-swipe gestures spun the jewelry box (as if interacting with an object in the real world) until a desired function, presented on each facet of the box, was forward facing. Also described are features and settings, designed to ensure safe and effective use of the application, and help maintain user motivation and interest.",https://www.omicsonline.org/open-access/intuitive-navigation-in-computer-applications-for-people-with-parkinsons-2090-2719-1000115.pdf,

In the first duet of Oberon and Titania, Neumeier forms plastic leitmotifs, which are developed in further appearances of the characters. The choreographer uses emphatically profiled, graphic and carefully geometric positions of the performers' bodies, additionally accentuating this with tight-fitting costumes; the parties receive active choreographic development based on a technically saturated duet dance, replete with high supports with acrobatic elements using extreme flexibility and stretching of the ballerina.

В работе используются традиционные методы и приемы семасиологического (компонентного, дефиниционного, контекстного, дискурсивного) исследования, а результаты этого анализа последовательно осмысливаются с когнитивных позиций и в результате этого выстраиваются ментальные модели.Результаты и обсуждение. Театр в русской картине мира является одним из главных концептов, он и занимает важное место в авторской картине мира М. Плисецкой. Сопоставление материалов толковых и ассоциативных словарей и анализы фрагментов текстов, извлеченных из Национального корпуса русского языка, позволяют выявить понятийные, образные и оценочные признаки концепта в национальной картине мира. В русской культуре и литературе театр не только относится к искусству, но и влияет на нравственные и моральные качества народа, приносит эстетическое наслаждение, способствует развитию личности. Для реконструкции индивидуально-авторского концепта театр моделировали ассоциативно-смысловое поле (АСП) театр в мемуарном дискурсе. В исследуемое поле входят 263 лексемы, которые разделены на шесть микрополей: танцевальная и музыкальная терминология; театр как здание или место; люди, имеющие отношение к театру; различные виды театральной деятельности; атрибуты театральной деятельности и театр в системе советского государства. Выявив ассоциации и оценочные дискурсы, связанные с театром, обнаружена высокая эмоциональность и экспрессивность. Признаки театра (в большинстве случаев Большого театра) на ценностном уровне можно разделить на четыре части: Большой в парадигме советской власти, закулисье Большого театра, театр как тяжелый и порой опасный труд и Большой как жизнь и судьба М. Плисецкой. Заключение. М. Плисецкая видела театр изнутри, это позволяет раскрыть особенности концепта в ее индивидуально-авторской картине мира: на понятийном уровне театр шире и богаче, чем в национальной картине мира, в АСП входят лексемы, связанные со сценой, балетом, музыкой, публикой, идеологической цензурой и др. На образном и ценностном уровнях в представлении автора театр многогранен, для автора в юности предстает как источник удовольствия и радости в тяжелое время, затем концепт театр соотносится только с Большим, эмоционально-оценочно усложняется: отношение балерины к театру двойственно: возмущение, презрение к Большому в парадигме советской власти, с другой стороны, театр для М. Плисецкой – вся жизнь, для сцены, публики, творчества, балета чаще всего встречаются положительные эмоциональные оценки. Ценностные признаки выражаются эмоционально-оценочной лексикой, языковыми и окказиональными метафорами, синтаксическим параллелизмом и эмоциональным контрастом. Introduction. At present, the study of the linguistic picture of the world is carried out in various fields of the humanities. Verbalization and reconstruction of an individual picture of the world are one of the most important tasks of modern linguistics, this is carried out on the basis of an analysis of specific concepts. This article discusses the concept of theater in the individual-author’s world picture of M. Plisetskaya.The aim of our study is determining the conceptual, figurative and evaluative components of the concept of theater, which are characteristic of the individual author’s world picture of Maya Plisetskaya (M. P.) in the background of the national picture of the world. Material and methods. The study is based on the book of memoirs of the ballerina Maya Plisetskaya “I, Maya Plisetskaya”, as well as the National Corpus of the Russian Language and lexicographic sources of various types. In this study we use traditional methods and techniques of semasiological research (component, definitional, contextual, discursive analysis), and the results of these analyzes are consistently comprehended from cognitive perspective and, as a result, mental models are built.Results and discussion. Theater in the Russian picture of the world is one of the main concepts, it occupies an important place in the author’s world picture of M. Plisetskaya. Comparison of materials from explanatory and associative dictionaries and analyzes of fragments of texts, which are extracted from the National Corpus of the Russian Language, allow us to identify the conceptual, figurative and evaluative features of the concept in the national picture of the world. In Russian culture and literature, theater not only refers to art, but also affects the moral qualities of people, brings to them aesthetic pleasure, and contributes to the development of individual. We modeled the associative-semantic field of theater in memoir discourse to reconstruct the individual-author’s theater. The field includes 263 lexemes, divided into 6 microfields: dance and music terminology, theater as a building or place, people related to the theater, various types of theatrical activity, attributes of theatrical activity and theater in the system of the Soviet state.Having identified associations and evaluative discourses, which are associated with theater, we found high emotionality and expressiveness, the features of the theater (in most cases the Bolshoi Theater) at the value level can be divided into 4 parts: Bolshoi Theater in the paradigm of Soviet power, backstage of the Bolshoi, theater as heavy and dangerous work, and Bolshoi as the life and fate of M. Plisetskaya.Conclusion. M. P. saw the theater from the inside, this allows us to reveal the features of the concept in her individual author’s picture of the world: at the conceptual level, theater is wider and richer than in the national picture of the world, our associative-semantic field includes lexemes, which are associated with the stage, ballet, music, audience, ideological censorship, etc. At the figurative and value levels, in the author’s view, theater is multifaceted; For the author, in her youth it appears as a source of pleasure and joy in difficult times, then the concept of theater correlates only with the Bolshoi, it becomes emotionally and evaluatively complicated: attitude of M. P. to theater is ambivalent: indignation, contempt for the Bolshoi in the paradigm of Soviet power, on the other hand, for M. P. theater is all her life, When it is about the stage, the public, and the creativity of the ballet, there are often positive emotional assessments. Value signs are expressed by emotional and evaluative vocabulary, linguistic and occasional metaphors, syntactic parallelism and emotional contrast.",https://vestnik.tspu.edu.ru/files/vestnik/PDF/articles/khuan_syaoyuy_.._73_84_4_222_2022.pdf,

The director of the ballet, dedicated to the 700th anniversary of the death of the outstanding Italian Renaissance humanist poet Dante Alighieri, was Yaroslav Ivanenko, a graduate of the Kyiv State Choreographic School who began his dancing career at the National Opera and has worked abroad since 1996, including as a soloist with the Hamburg Ballet under the direction of John Neumayer in 1998-2010. Yaroslav Ivanenko has extensive experience in ballet mastery, his choreographic productions have been repeatedly honoured with prestigious awards. Since 2011, he has been heading the ballet troupe of the Kiel Opera House in Germany, where he has staged many ballets in various choreographic styles. The staging of Dante at the National Opera of Ukraine was an interesting experience both for the Kyiv ballet troupe, which got acquainted with new choreographic vocabulary, and for the choreographer himself, for whom the creation of an original full-scale performance based on Dante’s biography and works was a new stage in his development, compared to working on plotless ballets and interpreting well-known classical plots. In an interview with the author of the article, a former ballerina of the National Opera of Ukraine, Yaroslav Ivanenko revealed the details of the work on the staging of Dante on the Kyiv stage, the creation of the director’s concept of the performance, the musical composition, which harmoniously combines works by classical and contemporary composers, the choreographic text, and shared his thoughts on the prospects for the development of ballet art and culture in general. In particular, the ballet master, who has also staged «Romeo and Juliet» and « Evgeny Onegin», analyses the images of these classical works in the context of the present, and finds semantic parallels with the story of Dante’s ideal love for Beatrice, whose image inspired the artist to create sonnets and poems that became part of the treasury of Italian Renaissance poetry.",https://nte.etnolog.org.ua/uploads/2023/3/publications/84.pdf,

This ﬁ nding contradicts the current postulate that activation of a speci ﬁ c motor neuron would always result in a pre-determined ﬁ xed muscle response, adding important new perspectives in the ﬁ elds of neurobiology, biomechanics, and robotics. When a dancing ballerina executes her turns, she typically controls her head position and ﬁ xes her gaze on a single orientation point. This spotting technique helps her to maintain balance and to prevent dizziness during her complex movements. But how is this mind-body control achieved from a neurobiological point of view? All motor behavior requires signal transduction from the brain towards the appropriate target muscles. The efferent neurons conveying the signal from the central nervous system to the periphery are known as motor neurons (MNs). Upper MNs start in the cortex and brain stem from where they transmit neural signals via long axonal processes to interneurons and lower MNs in the spinal cord. Then, lower MNs carry the signal onto their respective target muscles, to which they connect via a terminal structure known as a neuromuscular junction (NMJ). Here, a neurotransmitter is released into the synaptic cleft, leading to the electrical activation and contraction of the muscle ﬁ bers. Lower MNs are therefore regarded as the ﬁ nal, common elements of the neuronal signal transduction chain necessary for the execution of movements. Despitethis classical hierarchical view on the composition of motor circuits, remarkably little is known about the exact contributions that individual neurons or muscles of the motor system make to achieve a speci ﬁ c movement.

The White Ballets . Toronto, ON: Tundra Books, 2011. Print Many classical ballets choreographed in the 1800s are considered “white ballets,” since during at least one scene, the prima ballerina and the dancers in the corps de ballet are all costumed in traditional long white tutus. This work by former ballerina Rajka Kupesic retells the storylines for three of these ballets: Swan Lake, Giselle, and La Bayadere. Each story is illustrated with reproductions of four of Kupesic’s paintings. The book’s introduction explains a bit about this background and gives Kupesic’s reasons for choosing these ballets. It would have been helpful if she had mentioned other “ballets blancs” such as “Les Sylphides” so interested readers could seek information about them as well. Each story is followed by an “About the ballet” page. This page includes a brief history of the ballet’s early performances, identifies the choreographer and musical composer, and provides a commentary about each illustration and its meaning. The dust cover displays one of the images from “Swan Lake” while the image on the front cover depicts a scene from “Giselle.” The work is labeled as being for all ages and indeed there is something for everyone. The stories are told using simple language that young girls could read, while the commentaries would be appreciated by an older audience. Despite the explanations, young children may not understand the nuances of the artwork. The paintings are intended to portray the atmosphere of the performance, though younger readers may have preferred a more literal interpretation of the story. I fear the reprinting of the paintings may have led to some loss of their intended effect. I would not have noticed the application of gold leaf had it not been mentioned, and in the two page “Swan Lake” illustration, although the eye is supposed to be drawn to the image of Odette in the back window, the page fold interferes. Art is subjective, and many readers may find the illustrations breathtaking. While there are many beautiful elements to the illustrations such as the costuming and backgrounds, there are certain features that are not to my personal liking. Several dancers assume poses from the actual choreography, but in several cases the postures look awkward with overly inclined heads and weirdly proportioned and angled legs. One always thinks of ballerinas as beautiful young maidens but these dancers seem to have very prominent noses and oddly spaced eyes. The faces all seem to have the same emotionless expression, and the poses all seem quite static with little allusion to movement. Despite my comments about the illustrations, many people will appreciate the artwork. The “About” pages will be beneficial for aspiring ballerinas as they learn some dance history and something of the choreographers and composers of the major classical ballets. Because the stories themselves stay true to the ballets and can be enjoyed by readers of all ages, this work would make a nice addition to any ballet lover’s personal library.

Therefore, we tested whether wearing compressive pantyhose (CP) during the Ballet-specific aerobic fitness test (BAFT) would influence performance, recovery, physiological, and perceptual indicators. Additionally, this pilot study tested the feasibility of the research procedures and informed adjustments for the main study. Nine young classical ballerinas attended two sessions on different days: a) wearing CP (pressure of 20–30 mmHg) or b) wearing a placebo pantyhose ([PLA] no compression, containing an illusory effect) during the BAFT. We assessed heart rate (HR) and rating of perceived exertion (RPE) during the BAFT, perceived recovery (PRS), lower-limb delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS) at Pre and 24 h Post, and standing heel-rise test performance at Pre, 30 min, and 24 h Post. No variables differed (p>0.05) between CP and PLA (e.g., HR mean over 5 BAFT phases: 178±14 bpm vs. 179±17 bpm, p=0.63; RPE 30 min post: 9.1±0.8 vs. 9.1±0.8 arbitrary units, p=0.94).

Under consideration is a specific form of art synthesis – singing in modern ballet. The synthesis of arts is attributive to the poetics of European opera, where a choreographic plan is used, however, singing in ballet is a rather rare phenomenon against the background of the dominance of singing in the operas of the 18th and 19th centuries. Nonetheless, there are eloquent examples of the return of singing in a ballet as a characteristic feature of the innovative choreographic theatre (“Pulcinella” by I. Stravinsky). The relevance of the topic is explained by the lack of musicological research devoted to the functions of singing as a component of ballet, while in modern practice there are clear precedents for the revival of this phenomenon. Some topical sources indicate the synthetic type of theatrical spectacle in the context of French Baroque culture (Danshina, 2010; Anfilova, 2004; Chepalov, 2008 and others), but the vocal component is not considered as a special problem. The purpose of the article is to investigate the interaction of vocal and ballet arts in the modern practice of ballet productions of the Kharkiv Opera and Ballet Theater (Ukraine) in the retrospective context of European musical-theatrical traditions. Modern ballet “The Little Prince” based on A. Saint-Exupery’s novel of the same name (2016) staged by Kharkiv ‘M. Lysenko’ National Academic Theatre of Opera and Ballet (KhNATOB) was chosen to be the material of the article. The following research methods are used: historical and typological approach that distinguishes the styles of European opera culture; semantic analysis of ballet performance as an artistic text; interpretative-cognitive comprehension of singing and its functions in ballet dramaturgy. Presentation of the research results. The creative experience of the French choreographer Johann Nuss on the stage of Kharkiv Opera Theatre – the premiere of the modern ballet “The Little Prince”, testified to the actualization of intertextuality in solving the problem of the relationship between singing and dancing. Traditional artistic plans are an important factor in the dramaturgy of a ballet performance. Together with two purely choreographic levels where the virtuoso skill of dancers and plastique of “talking” movements prevails, the singing voice is the third plan, which indicates the continuity of the French tradition (one can remember the model of J. B. Rameau’s “Gallant India”). The choice of musical material for the performance belongs to J. Nuss. He “saw” the image of Rose, who the Prince is in love with, twofold: as a choreographic-plastic and a “singing” one. Respectively, the role of Rose is embodied by a ballerina (Honoured Artist of Ukraine Iryna Khandazhevska) and a singer (Honoured Artist of Ukraine Olena Starykova, soprano). Dressed in a costume of a flower, the singer represents an ideal creature: themes from R. Glier’s and S. Rachmaninoff’s vocal compositions sound. The appearance of other bright characters is accompanied by instrumental music fragments, these are the King (J. S. Bach’s Second Orchestral Suite), the Ambitious Man (L. Delibes “Coppélia”), the Drunkard (“Winter” from A. Vivaldi’s “The Seasons”), and the Banker (J. S. Bach’s Suite for Cello Solo). So, the introduction of coloratura singing into the spectator’s plan of perception of the expressive-linguistic means of ballet opens a new symbolic world. Conclusions. Singing in a ballet is a specific manifestation of the art synthesis characteristic of modern choreographic performance. The vocal art emphasizes the highest, spiritual degree of communication, adding to the spectators’ experience a cathartic component. The interpretative function of singing in the concept of the performance is obvious: singing is a symbol (expression) of the divine essence of a human. Energy of vocals, multiplied by the traditional means of classical choreography and modern ballet, is a component of “multimedia modality” (Petrovic, 2017) as a sign of the interpretive thinking of the directors. Understanding the action of multimodality in the space-time of ballet is an interpretative dimension of spiritual reality. The prospect of researching. The study of modern forms of stage life of “singing in a ballet” indicates the need to develop this concept in the theoretical and methodological key, as well as to consider other examples of ballet performances (“One Thousand and One Nights” by F. Amirov, “Spartacus” by A. Khachaturian in Kharkiv Opera and others).",https://doi.org/10.34064/khnum1-62.05,

The research materials are previously unpublished documents from the archives of Moscow, Saint Petersburg, Saransk, as well as articles from Russian periodicals of the 1910s; reviews of professional critics and memories about the ballerina. Based on the use of comparative historical, biographical, and semiotic methods, the article reconstructs Fedorova’s biography, considers various aspects of the reception of her personality and work by contemporaries: figures of literature (Vyacheslav Ivanov), theater (S. Giatsintova, E. Gogoleva, K. Stanislavsky, V. Telyakovsky), ballet (S. Grigoriev, B. Nizhinskaya), art critics and historians of ballet (Yu. Belyaev, P. Liven, S. Mamontov), other representatives of the humanitarian intelligentsia (S. Grigorov). Sofia Fedorova is known as an unsurpassed performer of characteristic dances in ballet and opera performances, as well as a ballerina who embodied the images of the innovative choreography of A.A. Gorsky and M.M. Fokin. Vyacheslav Ivanov claimed that the ballerina had “two faces”: the “daytime”, “galloping” Fedorova and the “nighttime” Fedorova, whose sphere was the “dark mysticism of the soul”. The author of the article traced the history of the creation of the three sculptures and revealed their artistic features and semantic content. The three sculptors created completely different sculptural images of Fedorova: a monumental marble figure (Ryndzyunskaya), an easel marble bust (Erzia), and a decorative porcelain figurine (Danko). According to the findings of the author of the study, Danko portrays Fedorova as “daytime” and “galloping” (nevertheless, she manages to create an ethereal image). Ryndzyunskaya also shows Fedorova as “daytime”, the sculptor is attracted by the ballerina’s grace, the beauty and expressiveness of her movement: portraying it, she focuses on purely plastic problems. Erzia is the only sculptor of the three who managed to see and capture the “nighttime” Fedorova. He is not interested in the ballerina’s dance, but in her complex deep inner world: he reflects the “dark mysticism” of her soul, conveys the state of tensity and anxiety that engulfed the woman, revealing not only signs of her incipient mental illness, but also her keen sense of the catastrophic state of the world (during World War I and the impending revolution).",https://doi.org/10.36343/sb.2020.22.2.011,

Through the privileged lens of Sofia Fuoco’s »microhistory«, this essay focuses on the critical and biographical multicultural discourses of the time, but also it investigates the modes of construction of the artistic identity of an Italian dancer of the mid-Nineteenth Century Europe.",https://oajournals.fupress.net/index.php/drammaturgia/article/download/14133/13009,

When her mother takes her to her first ballet lesson, Rosie struggles with the steps and is the least graceful girl in class. Rosie becomes discouraged until one Saturday, she wakes to find a gift of red ballet slippers by her bed. She’s now able to dance beautifully. She thinks it is because of her shoes until her dance teacher tells her that she was always talented, she just needed to practice and build confidence. At some point, most little girls dream of becoming a famous ballerina and will be drawn to the book. Unfortunately, the story is uninspiring and a bit corny. The stated intended age range is 4 through 8 but the book is much too short and simplistic for most 7 and 8 year olds, though it may still appeal to younger girls. The moral about hard work paying off would likely not come through clearly for young girls. While the illustrations by Diane Goode are colourful and fun, they depict young girls en pointe performing steps that are much too advanced for their age. They are, however, typical ballet poses which is perhaps why they were used. Aspiring ballerinas would be better off reading tales of actual ballets, as Rosie does before bed, and viewing more realistic photographs of dancers.

The given article is devoted to study of the Ukrainian ballet continuing to produce new ways of implementation of the ideas and artistic images in the beginning of the XXI century. The production of the ballet “Peer Gynt” on the music by E. Grieg, done by People’s artist of Ukraine V. Pisarev for the troupe of Donetsk ‘A. Solovianenko’ Academic State Theatre of Opera and Ballet is a remarkable example of this process. The production’s premiere was on, 1997, May 17, in the framework of the international theatre project “Ukraine – Norway”. Twenty years later, in 2017, the new variant of the ballet has been created for Kharkiv National Opera and Ballet Theatre named after M. V. Lysenko. This “Kharkiv variant” was staged regarding specifics of Kharkiv theatre’s troupe, while retaining the choreographic text of the original; it is marked by scenography and decorations being more spectacular and modern. The work by H. Ibsen received harsh critique from literary scholars who gave plenty of negative reviews of it, and it was E.Grieg’s music that led this poetic drama to wide recognition and popularity it has today. H. Ibsen’s piece became a base for more than the ten of films, directed from 1915 until 2006. As well as E Grieg’s music, which mostly accompanies the theatrical and cinematic interpretations of the drama poem, there are homonymous opera by Werner Egk (1938) and the ballet by John Neumeier, created in a collaboration with A. Schnittke (1987). As a ballet, the “Peer Gynt” is being staged since 1922 up to present day. The object of this research is musically-plastique image of Solveig. The aim of the study is to reveal specifics of musically-plastique, choreographic means, which are used to portray Solveig’s image in V. Pisarev’s production of ballet “Peer Gynt” regarding literary source. The article uses such methods as: 1) historical, allowing to place selected work into the perspective of development of ballet theatre in XXI century; 2) genre approach conditioned by specifics of means of expression used in choreographic art; 3) stylistic, used to regard given ballet in the context of choreographic art. The research results. H. Ibsen elevated the story to the level of philosophical parable about man’s freedom to choose his own path and about the price this freedom comes with. A psychological portrait of the protagonist, wanderer Peer Gynt, combines traits of both humanist and insane. The playwright creates opposition between him and Solveig, majestic in her spiritual martyrdom. According to H. Ibsen’s conception, it is Solveig, being an incarnation of the very best feminine traits, such as chastity, fidelity and kindness, who saves the prodigal soul of the protagonist. In the end of his earthly path, Peer Gynt finally finds what he has been looking for his entire life – self-sacrificial Love, saving him from the eternal suffering near his death. The libretto is written by Yu. Stanishevsky, historian of ballet. The author significantly abridges the text of the dramatic poem, reducing the number of acts from five to two. The First act consists of 4 tableaus, the Second has only two; Yu. Stanishevsky omits several situations in order to make the spectacle more dynamic. The libretto features the image of Solveig only six times: thrice in the First act and thrice in the Second. But despite sporadicity and brevity of Solveig’s presence on the stage, this image plays a leading role in the dramaturgy of the ballet, no less significant than Peer Gynt. Today the poem “Peer Gynt” by H. Ibsen is hardly imaginable without E. Grieg’s music. Its score (op. 23) consisted of 28 numbers , and it included dance intermedia and introduction to every Act; dance fragments, genre scenes, portraits, fantastic episodes and landscape sceneries. Later, the composer compiled the most interesting and self-sufficient numbers into two Suites. Conspicuous Romantic style of the score might be compared to the image of blonde-haired maiden Solveig, who betokens pure femininity. The ballet of V. Pisarev consists of 8 tableaus and 3 numbers. In order to create this ballet spectacle, its author used several types of choreographic art to reveal its idea more profoundly. V. Pisarev embodied the plot of H. Ibsen’s poem using a fusion of classical and neo-classical dance as well as a reconstruction of the folklore-scenic Norwegian dance. Ballet master draws attention to the inner world of a protagonist, who is facing a dilemma: either to remain for fix the situation, or to run away once again. Significance of Solveig’s image is emphasized by the choreographic text of the ballet, as her role becomes a plastique leit-motiv of the whole work. Choreographic lexicon of Solveig is founded upon traditional Classical dance and occasional movements of contemporary dance. Conclusions. The image of Solveig is a demanding one, both technically and psychologically as the ballerina must demonstrate advanced technique and high artistry. Solveig’s dance is plastique, sculpture-like, filled with profound psychologism and elaborated expressiveness. Solveig is one of the most powerful and iconic examples of femininity and self-sacrificial love in romantic art keeping its actuality until today.",https://doi.org/10.34064/khnum1-57.12,

After their defections they played a critical role in shaping what can be considered today’s American ballet. By exploring how foreign dancers were able to contribute so much to an American cultural establishment, one can start to understand the distinct differences between the cultures behind capitalist America and the communist Soviet Union during the 1900s. Three specific dancers, George Balanchine, Natalia Makarova, and Mikael Baryshnikov made significant contributions to American ballet. When put together, their contributions form the core of the American art form seen on stages across the nation and abroad today. ina Ananiashvili, a famous Georgian ballerina, once said, “ballet is not just movement, not simply abstract. It’s something beautiful.” Ballet is movement that expresses much more than a story; it has the ability to examine cultural and political changes of the time through movement. It is the meaning behind the choreography that expresses the deeper cultural significance. Ballet becomes especially important to examine in times of extreme cultural upheaval within a country, or during times of cultural competition between nations. Both of these scenarios can be seen during the Cold War, with the new Bolshevik Revolution’s creation of a Soviet society and the reaction of the United States to its communist competitors. The Soviet Union and the United States fostered very different artistic atmospheres throughout most of the 20 th century. The Soviet Union used art, especially ballet, which had been a popular art form in the country beginning in 1689, as a way to spread its political message. Within the United States, ballet was seen as a copied art form, derivative 1 Nancy Ellison, The Ballet Book: Learning and Appreciating the Secrets of Dance (New York: Universe, 2003), 46. 2 Cyril W. Beaumont, A Short History of Ballet (London: Wyman &Sons, 1933), 25. of its predecessors with little to offer to the general public. Opposing Soviet and American cultures cultivated a fascinating partnership of artistry that became the unique American ballet style. The oppression Soviet dancers faced created a desire for them to expand the boundaries of ballet, while the artistic freedom of American artists never encouraged them to dream for more. As a result, Soviet defectors created new choreography that would become the new Americanized brand of ballet. Historians have looked at ballet as a way to study culture as it pertains to history. For instance, Cadra McDaniel deals with the cultural exchange between the United States and the Soviet Union when the Bolshoi Ballet Company toured America in 1959. McDaniel uses this exchange to examine the cultural tension between the two nations. She then goes on to argue that the Soviets believed “ballets were to be uncomplicated and convey a clear pro-Soviet message that can be grasped easily without words or an in-depth explanation.” The pro-Soviet message that was supposedly conveyed through their ballets was not picked 3 Cadra Peterson McDaniel, American-Soviet Cultural Diplomacy: The Bolshoi Ballet’s American Premiere (Lanham: Lexington Books, 2015), 1. 4 Ibid, xxii.

A detailed analysis of the ""white"" duet allows us to conclude that the studied choreographic fragment is markedly different from the other two duets of Marguerite and Arman. From the point of view of developing the images of the main characters, this is the only episode of the play in which Neumeier allows the audience to see the light lyrics in the relationship between Marguerite and Armand. In the ""white"" duet, the choreographic innovations of the choreographer in the field of technically saturated duet dance, replete with upper supports, with a lack of preparation for them and constant control by the partner of the ballerina's movements, are especially justified. They are the main means of plastic expressiveness, creating the effect of flight, an unbroken flow of movements, as well as the visualization of musical legato. It is this duet technique (later actively used by the choreographer) that can be called a distinctive feature of the choreographic style of J. Neumeier.",http://nbpublish.com/library_get_pdf.php?id=37921,

Once, Paul Klee painted the Abstract Ballet (1937) in the manner that some musicians made innovative experiments in the music, or in the same manner as Oskar Schlemmer found a unique form of expression for his Triadisches Ballet. But, there were two types of ballet in the interwar period of the twentieth century between which we can differentiate: the Classical ballet (wich maintains a Romantic line too) and the Avant-garde ballet that appeared through the Triadisches Ballet composed by Oskar Schlemmer. Some dancers like Mikhail Baryshnikov brought the ballet in the area of the classic performance, and others as Maya Plisețkaia (the ʻprima-ballerinaʼ of the twentieth century) brought the ballet to a classical-romantic line. Apparently, Oskar Schlemmer and Paul Klee wanted to dislodge the corrugations as they may have dislodged a cupboard or a box.

In terms of short and long-term outcomes, correlated studies have made inconsistent conclusions and this issue remains controversial. Based on a previous cohort study conducted in our center, we aim to prospectively compare the safety and efficacy between CL and standard limb (SL) configuration in patients receiving EVAR. Methods This is a prospective, single-center, non-randomized controlled trial. A total of 275 patients who meet the inclusion criteria will be enrolled and allocated with a 4:11 ratio of CL to SL, which is based on results of our previous study. All patients will receive same perioperative management and postoperative medications. All EVAR procedures will be performed under standard protocol, utilizing Endurant II or IIs Stent Graft. The configuration of the graft stent will be decided by surgeons and confirmed by final angiography. The primary outcome is 3-year freedom from major adverse limb-graft events (MALEs).

Neumeier images of the main characters of the ballet ""A Midsummer Night's Dream"". A meaningful interpretation of the choreographic embodiment of Hippolyta and Theseus, one of the two hypostases of the main characters of the ballet, is carried out in order to identify their features in the context of the performance and the choreographer's creativity. Based on the methods of ballet studies analysis approved by historians and ballet theorists Dobrovolskaya, Krasovskaya, Surits, the author used comparative-historical, ideological-artistic and analytical methods, as well as the method of included observation (based on personal experience with Neumeier). In the course of the source analysis, the author used video materials from the archives of the Hamburg ""Ballettzentrum"" and the Moscow Bolshoi Theater. A detailed analysis of the choreographic score of the roles of Hippolyta and Theseus allows us to conclude that Neumeier makes two detailed duets that differ from each other as the main fragments characterizing these characters. In the first of them, the choreographer uses a rich duet technique: upper supports without approaches (often starting from kneeling positions), non–standard combinations of paired rotations - elements that determine the further line of development of his choreographic style. The composition and means of choreographic expressiveness of the second duet are rather atypical for Neumeier's work. Here, the choreographer, with poses and technical solo fragments of the dancers, hints at the similarity with the ballets of the classical heritage, with the help of which he emphasizes the ceremonial and ceremonious solemnity of this duet. It also uses such an additional attribute as a train, which gives the ballerina's movements even more weight and royalty. Thus, the choreographic development of the images of Hippolyta and Theseus occupies one of the key positions (along with Titania and Oberon) in the play ""A Midsummer Night's Dream"", and also becomes an important stage in the evolution of the author's style of J.

Taking inspiration from the socio-material approach of photography historian Elizabeth Edwards, the analysis downplays the question of content in favor of a focus on the material practices in the photographic studio at the level of the photographer as well as the dancer-model posing before the camera. Placed within a discourse of new materialism, performance and performativity, it moreover considers the resulting photos as material objects that perform in continuing processes of meaning production. An example of the latter discussed at the end of the text is Harald Giersing’s abstract painting ’The Dancer’ based on a photo of Jenny Hasselquist as The Dying Swan.",https://curis.ku.dk/ws/files/218473316/The_Performance_of_Pictorialist_Dance.pdf,
