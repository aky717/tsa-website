7213,P. Smith,"The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex",1871,Glasgow Medical Journal,,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/06ff24752c26d18922f277cfb829bcc479b380e1,,7,2025-03-27 18:43:58,JournalArticle,10.1038/003463A0,0028-0836,,3.0,,396.0,402.0,7213,46.84,7213,1,154,"II.THAT selection in relation to sex has been an important factor in the formation of the present breeds of animals was more than indicated in the “Origin of Species,“and the theory has since been especially worked out by Professor Haeckel. It includes two distinct hypotheses. One is that in contests between males, the weakest would go to the wall, and thus either be killed outright, or at least debarred more or less completely from transmitting their characters to another generation. This may be regarded as a particular case of Natural Selection, and may be compared with the theory of protection by mimicry, suggested by Mr. Bates, and carried out by him and by Mr. Wallace. But though in the lists of Love the battle is often to the strong, even more frequently it is to the beautiful. This introduces a new process, of which the effects are not nearly so obvious as those of Natural Selection, either in its simplest form or in the more complicated cases of mimicry, and of sexual selection by battle. Many circumstances must combine in order that the most successful wooers shall have a larger and more vigorous progeny than the rest. In the first place, all hermaphrodite and all sessile animals may be excluded, and also those cases in which sexual differences depend on different habits of life. Mr. Darwin then shows that secondary sexual characters are eminently variable, and that males vary more than females from the standard of the species, a standard determined by the young, by allied forms, and sometimes by the character of the male himself when his peculiar functions are only periodical, or when they have been artificially prevented. Moreover it is the males who take the active part in pairing, and who not only fight for the possession of their mates, but display their colours, their voice, or whatever be their peculiar attractions, in order to gain the same end. This rule is confirmed by the exceptional case of the cassowary and a few other species in which the hens court the male birds, fight together in rivalry, and accordingly assume the brighter colours and more attractive shape usually worn by the male. Not only the parental and incubating instincts, but the usual moral qualities of the two sexes are in these cases reversed: ""the females being savage, quarrelsome, and noisy, the males gentle and good.“But it is further necessary to show that the females exert a choice among the males, and that the latter are polygamous, or arrive earlier at the place of pairing, as is the case with some birds, or else exceed in numbers, at least when both sexes are mature. On this point a series of observations is recorded relating chiefly to man, to domesticated mammals, and to insects. The rule as to transmission of male characters to both sexes appears.to be that when variations appear late in life they are usually developed in the same sex only of the next generation, although they are, of course, transmitted in a latent condition through both; while, on the other hand, the differences which appear before maturity in the parent are equally developed in both sexes when transmitted to the offspring. The numerous apparent exceptions to these laws of inheritance and of sexual selection are examined with wonderful fairness and fertility in resource. I may particularly refer to the discussion of the ways in which the young and adults of both sexes differ among birds. The extreme intricacy of some of the questions considered is best shown by a postscript in which, with characteristic candour, the author corrects ""a serious and unfortunate error“in the eighth chapter.The Descent of Man, and Selection in relation to Sex.By Charles Darwin., &c. In two volumes. Pp. 428, 475. (Murray, 1871.)",,

The COVID-19 pandemic situation has brought this vulnerable population into renewed focus. Objective Our study aims to conduct a timely assessment of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of college students. Methods We conducted interview surveys with 195 students at a large public university in the United States to understand the effects of the pandemic on their mental health and well-being. The data were analyzed through quantitative and qualitative methods. Results Of the 195 students, 138 (71%) indicated increased stress and anxiety due to the COVID-19 outbreak. Multiple stressors were identified that contributed to the increased levels of stress, anxiety, and depressive thoughts among students. These included fear and worry about their own health and of their loved ones (177/195, 91% reported negative impacts of the pandemic), difficulty in concentrating (173/195, 89%), disruptions to sleeping patterns (168/195, 86%), decreased social interactions due to physical distancing (167/195, 86%), and increased concerns on academic performance (159/195, 82%). To cope with stress and anxiety, participants have sought support from others and helped themselves by adopting either negative or positive coping mechanisms. Conclusions Due to the long-lasting pandemic situation and onerous measures such as lockdown and stay-at-home orders, the COVID-19 pandemic brings negative impacts on higher education. The findings of our study highlight the urgent need to develop interventions and preventive strategies to address the mental health of college students.",https://www.jmir.org/2020/9/e21279/PDF,

The figure is not the Greek Dionysus, a strongly built, mature male wearing a robe. The figure is not the young Roman Bacchus represented with vine and dripping honey who seems to be free from self-consciousness. Instead, he chose a young boy without refined physical traits. He depicted a vulgar youngster, dressed as Bacchus, who put on a costume in an irreverent manner, waiting to drink the wine in the chalice, collecting the few scudi (Roman currency of the day) for modeling in order to run to the tavern at the end of the street for more drinking. Because of Caravaggio's lack of money for hiring models and his love for alcohol, many art historians suggested that the painting is a self-portrait. Furthermore, because the figure holds the chalice containing the red wine with his left hand, it has hypothesized that Caravaggio used the help of a mirror (1, 2). Figure 1 Bacchus (1596), Michelangelo Merisi from Caravaggio. Oil on canvas, 95 × 85 cm, Galleria degli Uffizi, Florence, Italy. Image reproduced with permission from the Soprintendenza Speciale per il Patrimonio Storico Artistico ... The dangerously inclined chalice with rippling wine, combined with the wine carafe with a very small pedestal, makes for a very wobbly scene. The wine, a Eucharistic symbol, could spill from the chalice held by the model and splatter from the carafe, which contains a small reflection of himself. The entire image gives us the concept of time where, in a moment of instability, a precariously balanced image of life could spiral into chaos. The basket of fruit, common trait in Caravaggio's paintings, is not just a decoration of beautiful foliage and succulent produce. The painting includes both a collection of savory and decayed fruits, framed by flourishing fresh green and drying yellow-brown leaves. The still life part of this painting embodies the simultaneous presence of health and sickness, life and death. This cycle of life however is not depicted only to represent the transient and inevitable nature of existence that would be depicted the following century in the vanitas by Flemish painters. The still life that shares the space with this Bacchus reminds the viewer of the futility of pleasure and the certainty of death, but lacks the symbols of hope and renewal against darkness, which are expressed by the presence of insects. Furthermore, the symbol of power, represented in fine arts by a crown, is in this figure illustrated by a crest of grapes and senescing leaves that reiterate the deterioration of life. With his depiction of Bacchus, Caravaggio used photo-like realism to deliver an accurate and precise diagnosis of Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD). With the model's features, Caravaggio was able to depict the neurological and psychiatric symptoms of alcoholism. The skin rosacea and dirty fingernails allude to nutritional deficiency and poor personal hygiene. He showed both the impaired fine and gross motor movements; the hand tremor resulted in the undulating wine inside the chalice, and the possibility exists of losing the balance of the model's right elbow and hitting the fragile carafe. The dilated blood vessels showed by the flushed face, swollen eyelids, and red hands, are the physical characteristics of an individual suffering from AUD. In his direct realism, Caravaggio also chose to depict himself in another self-portrait during an illness characterized by strong jaundice (Sick Bacchus, 1594). Caravaggio, probably being an alcoholic himself, was spending a great deal of time in taverns. He had seen chronic alcoholic individuals with jaundice and had witnessed their death (assumed to be from liver failure due to cirrhosis) (3). Using the symbolism encoded in the still life, Caravaggio was able to illustrate the psychological characteristics of alcoholic individuals. Caravaggio depicted the decreasing of inhibition and the increasing of seductive behaviors of the model by using eternal life symbolism. The pomegranate is cracked, inferring fall from grace and open to sinful nature. The white and black grapes crowning the head of the model, which signify lewdness and lustful thoughts, are ripened and pungent, while the leaves, symbolizing loss of innocence, are yellowing and drying. There are no butterflies or moths to evoke the idea of rebirth, but just a codling moth entrance hole. This portrait is a sad and gloomy face of life that does not comprise salvation and resurrection. Many of the revisions in the Fifth Edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5, dsm5.org) are intended to provide diagnosis and clinical care support to non-psychiatrists (since primary care physicians are most likely to be the first to assess psychiatric symptoms) (4). One of the major changes is the merger of the two diagnoses of Alcohol Abuse and Alcohol Dependence into a single diagnosis called Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD). The medical community has perceived the merger of the criteria positively since the DSM-IV term dependence was restricted only to patients experiencing withdrawal during treatment (5) leaving some patients “diagnostic orphans” (6). In the DSM-5, those patients are included in the AUD criterion and continue receiving medical treatment as in other psychiatric disorders (7). The Bacchus, according to the DSM-IV criteria would not meet the full requirements for an Alcohol Dependence diagnosis because he is not an individual experiencing alcohol withdrawal during treatment and he does not appear to suffer of severe dependence (8). Furthermore, he probably would not meet the criteria of Alcohol Abuse since as a model, he is performing a job responsibility. Every aspect of the painting, however, suggests that Bacchus is suffering from AUD; the Bacchus would be a “diagnostic orphan.” Caravaggio challenged society with his controversial and revolutionary art. He developed a realism that forced his contemporaries to see the actual face of alcoholism. That image depicted more than 400 years ago is today the pictorial representation of AUD and patients with the updated DSM-5 criteria will obtain a diagnosis and will receive treatment.",https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyt.2013.00086/pdf,

The current study assesses rates of mental health outcomes in the Italian general population three to 4 weeks into lockdown measures and explores the impact of COVID-19 related potential risk factors. Methods A web-based survey spread throughout the internet between March 27th and April 6th 2020. Eighteen thousand one hundred forty-seven individuals completed the questionnaire, 79.6% women. Selected outcomes were post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS), depression, anxiety, insomnia, perceived stress, and adjustment disorder symptoms (ADS). Seemingly unrelated logistic regression analysis was performed to identify COVID-19 related risk factors. Results Endorsement rates for PTSS were 6,604 (37%), 3,084 (17.3%) for depression, 3,700 (20.8%) for anxiety, 1,301 (7.3%) for insomnia, 3,895 (21.8%) for high perceived stress and 4,092 (22.9%) for adjustment disorder. Being woman and younger age were associated with all of the selected outcomes. Quarantine was associated with PTSS, anxiety and ADS. Any recent COVID-related stressful life event was associated with all the selected outcomes. Discontinued working activity due to the COVID-19 was associated with all the selected outcomes, except for ADS; working more than usual was associated with PTSS, Perceived stress and ADS. Having a loved one deceased by COVID-19 was associated with PTSS, depression, perceived stress, and insomnia. Conclusion We found high rates of negative mental health outcomes in the Italian general population 3 weeks into the COVID-19 lockdown measures and different COVID-19 related risk factors.

Method: WMH Surveys in 24 countries (n = 68,894) assessed 29 lifetime traumas and evaluated PTSD twice for each respondent: once for the ‘worst’ lifetime trauma and separately for a randomly-selected trauma with weighting to adjust for individual differences in trauma exposures. PTSD onset-persistence was evaluated with the WHO Composite International Diagnostic Interview. Results: In total, 70.4% of respondents experienced lifetime traumas, with exposure averaging 3.2 traumas per capita. Substantial between-trauma differences were found in PTSD onset but less in persistence. Traumas involving interpersonal violence had highest risk. Burden of PTSD, determined by multiplying trauma prevalence by trauma-specific PTSD risk and persistence, was 77.7 person-years/100 respondents. The trauma types with highest proportions of this burden were rape (13.1%), other sexual assault (15.1%), being stalked (9.8%), and unexpected death of a loved one (11.6%). The first three of these four represent relatively uncommon traumas with high PTSD risk and the last a very common trauma with low PTSD risk. The broad category of intimate partner sexual violence accounted for nearly 42.7% of all person-years with PTSD. Prior trauma history predicted both future trauma exposure and future PTSD risk. Conclusions: Trauma exposure is common throughout the world, unequally distributed, and differential across trauma types with respect to PTSD risk. Although a substantial minority of PTSD cases remits within months after onset, mean symptom duration is considerably longer than previously recognized.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/20008198.2017.1353383?needAccess=true,

It also debates the semantic field where the representations and actions in favour of quality of life - such as the concept of development, democracy, quality, way and conditions of life - develop. In relation to the field of health, this article discusses the tendency to restrict the concept of quality of life to the biomedical area, associated with an economic assessment. It shows the variety of instruments created for measuring quality of life in accordance with the concept.

Participants saw their amateurish creations – of both utilitarian and hedonic products – as similar in value to the creations of experts, and expected others to share their opinions. Our account suggests that labor leads to increased valuation only when labor results in successful completion of tasks; thus when participants built and then destroyed their creations, or failed to complete them, the IKEA effect dissipated. Finally, we show that labor increases valuation of completed products not just for consumers who profess an interest in “do-it-yourself” projects, but even for those who are relatively uninterested.

Early skin-to-skin contact (SSC) begins ideally at birth and involves placing the naked baby, covered across the back with a warm blanket, prone on the mother's bare chest. According to mammalian neuroscience, the intimate contact inherent in this place (habitat) evokes neurobehaviors ensuring fulfillment of basic biological needs. This time may represent a psychophysiologically 'sensitive period' for programming future behavior. OBJECTIVES To assess the effects of early SSC on breastfeeding, behavior, and physiological adaptation in healthy mother-newborn dyads. SEARCH STRATEGY Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's and Neonatal Group's Trials Registers (August 2006), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library 2006, Issue 2), MEDLINE (1976 to 2006). SELECTION CRITERIA Randomized and quasi-randomized clinical trials comparing early SSC with usual hospital care. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS We independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. Study authors were contacted for additional information. MAIN RESULTS Thirty studies involving 1925 participants (mother-infant dyads), were included. Data from more than two trials were available for only 8-of-64 outcome measures. We found statistically significant and positive effects of early SSC on breastfeeding at one to four months postbirth (10 trials; 552 participants) (odds ratio (OR) 1.82, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.08 to 3.07), and breastfeeding duration (seven trials; 324 participants) (weighted mean difference (WMD) 42.55, 95% CI -1.69 to 86.79). Trends were found for improved summary scores for maternal affectionate love/touch during observed breastfeeding (four trials; 314 participants) (standardized mean difference (SMD) 0.52, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.98) and maternal attachment behavior (six trials; 396 participants) (SMD 0.52, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.72) with early SSC. SSC infants cried for a shorter length of time (one trial; 44 participants) (WMD -8.01, 95% CI -8.98 to -7.04). Late preterm infants had better cardio-respiratory stability with early SSC (one trial; 35 participants) (WMD 2.88, 95% CI 0.53 to 5.23). No adverse effects were found. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS Limitations included methodological quality, variations in intervention implementation, and outcome variability. The intervention may benefit breastfeeding outcomes, early mother-infant attachment, infant crying and cardio-respiratory stability, and has no apparent short or long-term negative effects. Further investigation is recommended. To facilitate meta-analysis, future research should be done using outcome measures consistent with those in the studies included here.

Two surfaces of discontinuity of density and elastic properties are commonly believed to exist below that part of the earth’s crust which is accessible to geologists, namely, the junction of the granitic layer with the basic rocks, and the surface of separation of the Wiechert metallic core from the rocky shell.

Since 1970 the incarceration rate in the United States has more than tripled, and in many cities-urban centers such as Washington, D.C.-it has increased over five-fold. Today, one out of every ten adult black men in the District is in prison and three out of every four can expect to spend some time behind bars. But the numbers don't reveal what it's like for the children, wives, and parents of prisoners, or the subtle and not-so-subtle effects mass incarceration is having on life in the inner city. Author Donald Braman shows that those doing time on the inside are having a ripple effect on the outside-reaching deep into the family and community life of urban America. Braman gives us the personal stories of what happens to the families and communities that prisoners are taken from and return to. Carefully documenting the effects of incarceration on the material and emotional lives of families, this groundbreaking ethnography reveals how criminal justice policies are furthering rather than abating the problem of social disorder. Braman also delivers a number of genuinely new arguments. Among these is the compelling assertion that incarceration is holding offenders unaccountable to victims, communities, and families. The author gives the first detailed account of incarceration's corrosive effect on social capital in the inner city and describes in poignant detail how the stigma of prison pits family and community members against one another. Drawing on a series of powerful family portraits supported by extensive empirical data, Braman shines a light on the darker side of a system that is failing the very families and communities it seeks to protect.",https://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.17629,

Such increases can only be identified by studies that use data collected before and during the pandemic. Longitudinal data are also needed to examine (1) the roles of previous distress and stressors in emotional distress during the pandemic and (2) how COVID-19-related stressors and coping strategies are associated with emotional distress when pre-pandemic distress is accounted for. Methods Data came from a cohort study (N = 768). Emotional distress (perceived stress, internalizing symptoms, and anger), COVID-19-related stressors, and coping strategies were measured during the pandemic/lockdown when participants were aged 22. Previous distress and stressors were measured before COVID-19 (at age 20). Results On average, participants showed increased levels of perceived stress and anger (but not internalizing symptoms) during the pandemic compared to before. Pre-COVID-19 emotional distress was the strongest predictor of during-pandemic emotional distress, followed by during-pandemic economic and psychosocial stressors (e.g. lifestyle and economic disruptions) and hopelessness, and pre-pandemic social stressors (e.g. bullying victimization and stressful life events). Most health risks to self or loved ones due to COVID-19 were not uniquely associated with emotional distress in final models. Coping strategies associated with reduced distress included keeping a daily routine, physical activity, and positive reappraisal/reframing. Conclusions In our community sample, pre-pandemic distress, secondary consequences of the pandemic (e.g. lifestyle and economic disruptions), and pre-pandemic social stressors were more consistently associated with young adults' emotional distress than COVID-19-related health risk exposures.",https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/BD42C8C4EDFEEC6255554B195EA4ADED/S003329172000241Xa.pdf/div-class-title-emotional-distress-in-young-adults-during-the-covid-19-pandemic-evidence-of-risk-and-resilience-from-a-longitudinal-cohort-study-div.pdf,

Our houses are more storm-proof than birds’ nests; we don’t have to choose between eating and keeping up with the herd; and if a visiting anthropologist were to ask what we really care about, what we are most attached to, we would have to pause and think. It turns out we are deeply attached to all sorts of things, we just like to cultivate detachment from them. “The common root” for such positions, says Graham Harman, “lies in the modern supposition that subject and object are two alien things, and that the best course of action lies in disentangling one from the other as cleanly as possible.”1 The environmental humanities harbors a foundational critique of such dualism, for instance with Val Plumwood in the early nineties.2 Environmental humanities turns to relations and networks as major concepts in its new conceptual architecture, extending even to “meshwork” for Tim Ingold.3 Now it seems axiomatic that no entity is on its own, yet the actual modes of relating one thing to another, in and among more or less heterogeneous networks, can sometimes slip through undescribed. The concept of attachment would demonstrate its utility in the field of the environmental humanities to the extent that it can help specify (without being able to carry it out in a short space such as this) the differences among, for instance, a hermit crab’s occupancy of its shell (fig. 1), photosynthesis’s dependency on sunlight, my own love for my family members, or a passion for music.4",https://read.dukeupress.edu/environmental-humanities/article-pdf/9/1/167/409110/167Muecke.pdf,

In this translation of his influential 1990 book Le Contrat Naturel , Serres calls for a natural contract to be negotiated between Earth and its inhabitants. World history is often referred to as the story of human conflict. Those struggles that are seen as our history must now include the uncontrolled violence that humanity perpetrates upon the earth, and the uncontrollable menace to human life posed by the earth in reaction to this violence. Just as a social contract once brought order to human relations, Serres believes that we must now sign a ""natural contract"" with the earth to bring balance and reciprocity to our relations with the planet that gives us life. Our survival depends on the extent to which humans join together and act globally, on an earth now conceived as an entity. Tracing the ancient beginnings of modernity, Serres examines the origins and possibilities of a natural contract through an extended meditation on the contractual foundations of law and science. By invoking a nonhuman, physical world, Serres asserts, science frees us from the oppressive confines of a purely social existence, but threatens to become a totalitarian order in its own right. The new legislator of the natural contract must bring science and law into balance. Serres ends his meditation by retelling the story of the natural contract as a series of parables. He sees humanity as a spacecraft that with the help of science and technology has cast off from familiar moorings. In place of the ties that modernity and analytic reason have severed, we find a network of relations both stranger and stronger than any we once knew, binding us to one another and to the world. The philosopher's harrowing and joyous task, Serres tells us, is that of comprehending and experiencing the bonds of violence and love that unite us in our spacewalk to the spaceship Mother Earth.

Author Notes Denis J. Bekkering is a Ph.D. Candidate in Religious Studies at the University of Waterloo in Ontario, Canada. His dissertation project explores ""unfaithful"" fan followings of controversial American televangelists. In addition to religion and film, his research interests include religion and media, religion and popular culture, and religion and sport. This film review is available in Journal of Religion & Film: https://digitalcommons.unomaha.edu/jrf/vol19/iss1/45 Andrey Zvyagintsev’s fourth feature, Leviathan, tackles themes that thread through his work: truth, death, justice, and human responses to the inscrutable, inevitable, and unfair. Opening with shots of the brutal majesty of the Barents Sea, Zvyagintsev leads us past frigid waters, primordial rockscapes, and rotten wooden ships to a hilltop, bayside home on the outskirts of a small town. Middle-aged mechanic Kolya (Aleksey Serebryakov) drives to the train station to pick up Dmitriy (Vladimir Vdovichenkov), an old army friend and Moscovite lawyer enlisted to help battle the expropriation of his family’s property by the greedy mayor Vadim (Roman Madyanov). Kolya warmly embraces his would-be savior, little aware that Dmitriy’s presence will further inflame Vadim’s efforts to crush him under the weight of an irredeemably corrupt system, and tear at his relationships with wife Lilya (Elena Lyadova) and teenage son Roma (Sergey Pokhodaev). Leviathan’s debt to the Book of Job is made explicit in a late scene. Battered by disloyalty, loss, and political strength, a drunken Kolya gazes pitifully out at the roiling sea and voices the age-old question of the nearly defeated: “Why, Lord?” Recharging his Vodka supplies at a shop he is greeted by Father Vasiliy (Igor Sergeev), filling a bag with loaves of bread for the poor. “Well,” Kolya challenges the priest on the shop’s steps, “where’s your merciful God Almighty?” “Mine is with me,” Father Vasiliy counters, “As for yours I wouldn’t know...Haven’t seen you in church.” Father Vasiliy’s subtle endorsement of the Orthodox Church as a source of salvation is decidedly ironic as, unknown to the pair, the diocese’s wellfed and financed bishop (Valeriy Grishko) urges an uncertain Vadim to rule with a heavy hand. “All power comes from God,” the bishop sternly lectures the anxious mayor, “Where there’s power, there’s might. If you hold power in your territory, solve your issues yourself, with your 1 Bekkering: Leviathan Published by DigitalCommons@UNO, 2015 might.” Although Father Vasiliy may distribute daily bread to the downtrodden, his superior makes certain that they will always remain so under a veil of fear. Through the caricatures of Vadim and the bishop, Zvyagintsev satirizes the collusion of Christianity and politics in contemporary Russia, and queries the religious authenticity and sincerity of a privileged and conservative Orthodox elite. The bishop’s closed-door advising of Vadim to forcefully deploy his power is ironically punctuated by a slow zoom on a bust of the suffering Christ, and juxtaposed, in a grimly comedic fashion, with a later sermon in which he publicly pronounces that the divine is not to be found in “strength,” but rather “love.” While the bishop promotes the Orthodox Church as a bastion of truth, morality, and order in a restless nation beset by ‘the enemy, Zvyagintsev argues that it is instead an agent of that ancient chaos referenced in the film’s title, visually symbolized through a surfacing whale glimpsed by Lilya at the height of her own despair, and a hulking, sun-bleached skeleton of the same lying at the feet of a distraught Roma as he weeps over his bleak and confusing circumstances. Asked by a defiant Kolya whether his situation would improve if he submitted to the authority of the church, Father Vasiliy concedes his ignorance – “Our Lord moves in mysterious ways” – while also relaying God’s declaration of humanity’s impotence in the face of apparent chaos, as written in the 41 st chapter of Job: “Can you pull in Leviathan with a fishhook, or tie down its tongue with a rope? Will it keep begging you for mercy? Will it speak to you with gentle words? Nothing on earth is its equal. It is king over all that are proud.” Comparing Kolya to Job, who was likewise ‘preoccupied with the meaning of life’ as he underwent unbelievable hardship, Father Vasiliy points out that the latter was blessed only after he had “resigned himself to his fate.” Although it is a well-intended lesson, Father Vasiliy unwittingly encourages Kolya’s acquiescence not to the mysteries of God, but to the injustices piled upon him by, in large part, 2 Journal of Religion & Film, Vol. 19 [2015], Iss. 1, Art. 45 https://digitalcommons.unomaha.edu/jrf/vol19/iss1/45 the priest’s own church. Whatever small comfort it may offer its adherents, Zvyagintsev portrays the Russian Orthodox Church as an essentially unspiritual extension of a governing system maintained through deception, intimidation, and control. During the bishop’s abovementioned sermon, preached before an attentive group of the area’s elite, Vadim’s young son looks up at the whitewashed ceiling of a newly constructed church, a gleamingly sterile edifice to the dominant order. Glancing at an overseeing icon of Christ, Vadim leans down and whispers an affectionate warning to his child – “God sees everything, son” – thereby directing him to obey the will of God as conveyed by the fraudulent church, through which, the bishop paradoxically promises, lies the path to true ‘freedom.’ This scene inversely echoes one earlier in the film, in which a stumblingly drunk Kolya shouts out for his own son in the ruins of an abandoned church on the town’s outskirts, claimed by local teenagers as a hangout. Informed that Roma had left for home not long before, Kolya, slumped against a brick wall, pulls from his jacket a half-full bottle of Vodka, tips it back, and gulps desperately. He looks longingly to the dark heavens beyond the church’s dilapidated ceiling, yet finds no answers. Teetering on the brink of oblivion, his eyes land on a decaying fresco of the beheading of John the Baptist, a stark reminder that even God’s most faithful servants are vulnerable to the destructive whims of the world’s rulers. Although it offers no solace to the tortured Kolya, Zvyagintsev presents the crumbling building as an ironic antithesis to the town’s authorized house of worship. Sharing cigarettes, beer, and laughter by a roaring fire, Roma and his friends find, in the dead church, freedom and fellowship unknown to those gathered within its sparkling, ‘living’ counterpart. It is in these moments that Zvyagintsev hints at the possibility of respite and salvation for the persecuted, as in a promise of care made to Roma by family friends Pasha (Aleksey Rozin) 3 Bekkering: Leviathan Published by DigitalCommons@UNO, 2015 and Angela (Anna Ukolova), thus preventing him from being swallowed up by the state like his father. What will not necessarily set one free, however, is the truth, as discovered by the staunchly secular lawyer Dmitriy. Justice being inaccessible through official channels, Dmitriy resorts to blackmail to aid Kolya, having uncovered considerable ‘dirt’ on the oppressive Vadim. Presented with a detailed record of his damnable acts, Vadim attempts to establish some common ground with his antagonist by asking whether he has been baptized. “I’m a lawyer, Vadim,” Dmitriy replies, “I believe in facts.” Yet, without adequate power to back them, Dmitriy’s truths ultimately leave him bloodied and bruised, as does his hidden betrayal of Kolya, once brought to light. In the end Zvyagintsev leads us out of his engrossing human drama the same way we came in, adding striking shots of Leviathan’s snow-dappled bones – a silent testimony to the deadly disorder of his nation. An exquisitely shot, expertly acted, and moving film, Leviathan well deserves its many international accolades. 4 Journal of Religion & Film, Vol. 19 [2015], Iss. 1, Art. 45 https://digitalcommons.unomaha.edu/jrf/vol19/iss1/45",https://doi.org/10.11606/issn.2237-4485,

Additional analyses focusing on individual differences in attachment anxiety and avoidance across BPD and control participants indicate that these divergent effects were driven by the anxiously attached, rejection-sensitive participants.

In this article, we review prospective research on personality trait change in response to nine major life events in the broader domains of love and work. METHOD We expected to find that life events lead to personality trait change to the extent that they have a lasting influence on individuals' thoughts, feelings, and behavior. Moreover, we predicted that love-related life events such as marriage or parenthood would be more strongly related to changes in traits that emphasize affective content, whereas work-related life events would be more likely to lead to change in traits that reflect behavioral or cognitive content. RESULTS The current state of research provided some evidence that life events can lead to changes in personality traits and that different life events may be differently related to specific trait domains.

This report summarizes data regarding suicidal ideation (i.e., seriously considered suicide) and behaviors (i.e., made a suicide plan, attempted suicide, and made a suicide attempt requiring medical treatment) from CDC’s 2019 Youth Risk Behavior Survey. Results are reported overall and by sex, grade, race/ethnicity, sexual identity, and sex of sexual contacts, overall and within sex groups. Trends in suicide attempts during 2009–2019 are also reported by sex, race/ethnicity, and grade. During 2009–2019, prevalence of suicide attempts increased overall and among female, non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, and 12th-grade students. Data from 2019 reflect substantial differences by demographics regarding suicidal ideation and behaviors. For example, during 2019, a total of 18.8% of students reported having seriously considered suicide, with prevalence estimates highest among females (24.1%); white non-Hispanic students (19.1%); students who reported having sex with persons of the same sex or with both sexes (54.2%); and students who identified as lesbian, gay, or bisexual (46.8%). Among all students, 8.9% reported having attempted suicide, with prevalence estimates highest among females (11.0%); black non-Hispanic students (11.8%); students who reported having sex with persons of the same sex or with both sexes (30.3%); and students who identified as lesbian, gay, or bisexual (23.4%). Comprehensive suicide prevention can address these differences and reduce prevalence of suicidal ideation and behaviors by implementing programs, practices, and policies that prevent suicide (e.g., parenting programs), supporting persons currently at risk (e.g., psychotherapy), preventing reattempts (e.g., emergency department follow-up), and attending to persons who have lost a friend or loved one to suicide.",https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/su/pdfs/su6901a6-H.pdf,

Why do we wince when we see other people hurt themselves? This review addresses these questions from the perspective of embodied simulation: observing the actions and tactile sensations of others activates premotor, posterior parietal and somatosensory regions in the brain of the observer which are also active when performing similar movements and feeling similar sensations. We will show that seeing the emotions of others also recruits regions involved in experiencing similar emotions, although there does not seem to be a reliable mapping of particular emotions onto particular brain regions. Instead, emotion simulation seems to involve a mosaic of affective, motor and somatosensory components. The relative contributions of these components to a particular emotion and their interrelationship are largely unknown, although recent experimental evidence suggests that motor simulation may be a trigger for the simulation of associated feeling states. This mosaic of simulations may be necessary for generating the compelling insights we have into the feelings of others. Through their integration with, and modulation by, higher cognitive functions, they could be at the core of important social functions, including empathy, mind reading and social learning.",https://doi.org/10.1098/rstb.2009.0058,

The GPI anchor is synthesized via a membrane-bound multistep pathway in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) requiring >20 gene products. The pathway is initiated on the cytoplasmic side of the ER and completed in the ER lumen, necessitating flipping of a glycolipid intermediate across the membrane. The completed GPI anchor is attached to proteins that have been translocated across the ER membrane and that display a GPI signal anchor sequence at the C terminus. GPI proteins transit the secretory pathway to the cell surface; in yeast, many become covalently attached to the cell wall. Genes encoding proteins involved in all but one of the predicted steps in the assembly of the GPI precursor glycolipid and its transfer to protein in mammals and yeast have now been identified. Most of these genes encode polytopic membrane proteins, some of which are organized in complexes. The steps in GPI assembly, and the enzymes that carry them out, are highly conserved. GPI biosynthesis is essential for viability in yeast and for embryonic development in mammals.

How and why do such disasters happen? Are the fatalities caused by relentless behavior of people or a psychological state of panic that makes the crowd ‘go mad’? Or are they a tragic consequence of a breakdown of coordination? These and other questions are addressed, based on a qualitative analysis of publicly available videos and materials, which document the planning and organization of the Love Parade in Duisburg, Germany, and the crowd disaster on July 24, 2010. Our analysis reveals a number of misunderstandings that have widely spread. We also provide a new perspective on concepts such as ‘intentional pushing’, ‘mass panic’, ‘stampede’, and ‘crowd crushes’. The focus of our analysis is on the contributing causal factors and their mutual interdependencies, not on legal issues or the judgment of personal or institutional responsibilities. Video recordings show that people stumbled and piled up due to a ‘domino effect’, resulting from a phenomenon called ‘crowd turbulence’ or ‘crowd quake’. Crowd quakes are a typical reason for crowd disasters, to be distinguished from crowd disasters resulting from ‘mass panic’ or ‘crowd crushes’. In Duisburg, crowd turbulence was the consequence of amplifying feedback and cascading effects, which are typical for systemic instabilities. Accordingly, things can go terribly wrong in spite of no bad intentions from anyone. Comparing the incident in Duisburg with others, we give recommendations to help prevent future crowd disasters. In particular, we introduce a new scale to assess the criticality of conditions in the crowd. This may allow preventative measures to be taken earlier on. Furthermore, we discuss the merits and limitations of citizen science for public investigation, considering that today, almost every event is recorded and reflected in the World Wide Web.",https://www.research-collection.ethz.ch/bitstream/20.500.11850/62522/2/Helbing_62522.pdf,

Ten women and 7 men married an average of 21.4 years underwent fMRI while viewing facial images of their partner. Control images included a highly familiar acquaintance; a close, long-term friend; and a low-familiar person. Effects specific to the intensely loved, long-term partner were found in: (i) areas of the dopamine-rich reward and basal ganglia system, such as the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and dorsal striatum, consistent with results from early-stage romantic love studies; and (ii) several regions implicated in maternal attachment, such as the globus pallidus (GP), substantia nigra, Raphe nucleus, thalamus, insular cortex, anterior cingulate and posterior cingulate. Correlations of neural activity in regions of interest with widely used questionnaires showed: (i) VTA and caudate responses correlated with romantic love scores and inclusion of other in the self; (ii) GP responses correlated with friendship-based love scores; (iii) hypothalamus and posterior hippocampus responses correlated with sexual frequency; and (iv) caudate, septum/fornix, posterior cingulate and posterior hippocampus responses correlated with obsession.

One of the conceptual challenges in healthcare literature is that compassion is often confused with sympathy and empathy. Studies comparing and contrasting patients’ perspectives of sympathy, empathy, and compassion are largely absent. Aim: The aim of this study was to investigate advanced cancer patients’ understandings, experiences, and preferences of “sympathy,” “empathy,” and “compassion” in order to develop conceptual clarity for future research and to inform clinical practice. Design: Data were collected via semi-structured interviews and then independently analyzed by the research team using the three stages and principles of Straussian grounded theory. Setting/participants: Data were collected from 53 advanced cancer inpatients in a large urban hospital. Results: Constructs of sympathy, empathy, and compassion contain distinct themes and sub-themes. Sympathy was described as an unwanted, pity-based response to a distressing situation, characterized by a lack of understanding and self-preservation of the observer. Empathy was experienced as an affective response that acknowledges and attempts to understand individual’s suffering through emotional resonance. Compassion enhanced the key facets of empathy while adding distinct features of being motivated by love, the altruistic role of the responder, action, and small, supererogatory acts of kindness. Patients reported that unlike sympathy, empathy and compassion were beneficial, with compassion being the most preferred and impactful. Conclusion: Although sympathy, empathy, and compassion are used interchangeably and frequently conflated in healthcare literature, patients distinguish and experience them uniquely. Understanding patients’ perspectives is important and can guide practice, policy reform, and future research.",https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0269216316663499,

METHODS The National Comorbidity Survey-Replication, conducted between February 2001 and February 2003, interviewed 826 adults in the Census Divisions later affected by Hurricane Katrina. The post-Katrina survey interviewed a new sample of 1043 adults who lived in the same area before the hurricane. Identical questions were asked about mental illness and suicidality. The post-Katrina survey also assessed several dimensions of personal growth that resulted from the trauma (for example, increased closeness to a loved one, increased religiosity). Outcome measures used were the K6 screening scale of serious mental illness and mild-moderate mental illness and questions about suicidal ideation, plans and attempts. FINDINGS Respondents to the post-Katrina survey had a significantly higher estimated prevalence of serious mental illness than respondents to the earlier survey (11.3% after Katrina versus 6.1% before; chi(2)1= 10.9; P < 0.001) and mild-moderate mental illness (19.9% after Katrina versus 9.7% before; chi(2)1 = 22.5; P < 0.001). Among respondents estimated to have mental illness, though, the prevalence of suicidal ideation and plans was significantly lower in the post-Katrina survey (suicidal ideation 0.7% after Katrina versus 8.4% before; chi(2)1 = 13.1; P < 0.001; plans for suicide 0.4% after Katrina versus 3.6% before; chi(2)1 = 6.0; P = 0.014). This lower conditional prevalence of suicidality was strongly related to two dimensions of personal growth after the trauma (faith in one's own ability to rebuild one's life, and realization of inner strength), without which between-survey differences in suicidality were insignificant. CONCLUSION Despite the estimated prevalence of mental illness doubling after Hurricane Katrina, the prevalence of suicidality was unexpectedly low. The role of post-traumatic personal growth in ameliorating the effects of trauma-related mental illness on suicidality warrants further investigation.",https://doi.org/10.2471/blt.06.033019,

Hence, the main purpose of this paper is to examine these mediating roles of brand love and brand trust on the brand experience and brand loyalty relationships. While the literature does not examine the distinct dimensions of brand experience and brand loyalty, this study fills up this gap and examines their detailed dimensions and effects on brand loyalty. Design/methodology/approach A total of 237 valid questionnaires on mobile phone brands were collected from respondents aged between 18 and 30, and analyzed using the partial least squares method. Findings Sensory experience is the major driver of brand love. Sensory experience mainly drives customers’ brand trust, while intellectual experience has no effects on brand trust. Brand love is the main mechanism in developing customers’ behavioral loyalty, so does brand trust in shaping their attitudinal loyalty. Brand love and brand trust have the mediating effects on the relationships between brand experience and brand loyalty. Originality/value It demonstrates two mediating roles of brand love and brand trust in the brand experience and brand loyalty relationships, and thus deepens the understanding of the processes in shaping customers’ brand loyalty. It departs from the prior works and examines the distinct dimensions of brand experience and brand loyalty, and thus presents a more detailed examination on these two constructs and their effects, than prior studies. It demonstrates the validities of the brand resonance model, the C-A-B and A-C-B models, key mediating variable model, particularly in mobile phone industry.",https://zenodo.org/record/4016740/files/MD_Draft_to_open_access_8.5.pdf,
