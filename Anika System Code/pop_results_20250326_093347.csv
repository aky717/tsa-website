It is responsible for an estimated nine million premature deaths per year, enormous economic losses, erosion of human capital, and degradation of ecosystems. Ocean pollution is an important, but insufficiently recognized and inadequately controlled component of global pollution. It poses serious threats to human health and well-being. The nature and magnitude of these impacts are only beginning to be understood. Goals: (1) Broadly examine the known and potential impacts of ocean pollution on human health. (2) Inform policy makers, government leaders, international organizations, civil society, and the global public of these threats. (3) Propose priorities for interventions to control and prevent pollution of the seas and safeguard human health. Methods: Topic-focused reviews that examine the effects of ocean pollution on human health, identify gaps in knowledge, project future trends, and offer evidence-based guidance for effective intervention. Environmental Findings: Pollution of the oceans is widespread, worsening, and in most countries poorly controlled. It is a complex mixture of toxic metals, plastics, manufactured chemicals, petroleum, urban and industrial wastes, pesticides, fertilizers, pharmaceutical chemicals, agricultural runoff, and sewage. More than 80% arises from land-based sources. It reaches the oceans through rivers, runoff, atmospheric deposition and direct discharges. It is often heaviest near the coasts and most highly concentrated along the coasts of low- and middle-income countries. Plastic is a rapidly increasing and highly visible component of ocean pollution, and an estimated 10 million metric tons of plastic waste enter the seas each year. Mercury is the metal pollutant of greatest concern in the oceans; it is released from two main sources – coal combustion and small-scale gold mining. Global spread of industrialized agriculture with increasing use of chemical fertilizer leads to extension of Harmful Algal Blooms (HABs) to previously unaffected regions. Chemical pollutants are ubiquitous and contaminate seas and marine organisms from the high Arctic to the abyssal depths. Ecosystem Findings: Ocean pollution has multiple negative impacts on marine ecosystems, and these impacts are exacerbated by global climate change. Petroleum-based pollutants reduce photosynthesis in marine microorganisms that generate oxygen. Increasing absorption of carbon dioxide into the seas causes ocean acidification, which destroys coral reefs, impairs shellfish development, dissolves calcium-containing microorganisms at the base of the marine food web, and increases the toxicity of some pollutants. Plastic pollution threatens marine mammals, fish, and seabirds and accumulates in large mid-ocean gyres. It breaks down into microplastic and nanoplastic particles containing multiple manufactured chemicals that can enter the tissues of marine organisms, including species consumed by humans. Industrial releases, runoff, and sewage increase frequency and severity of HABs, bacterial pollution, and anti-microbial resistance. Pollution and sea surface warming are triggering poleward migration of dangerous pathogens such as the Vibrio species. Industrial discharges, pharmaceutical wastes, pesticides, and sewage contribute to global declines in fish stocks. Human Health Findings: Methylmercury and PCBs are the ocean pollutants whose human health effects are best understood. Exposures of infants in utero to these pollutants through maternal consumption of contaminated seafood can damage developing brains, reduce IQ and increase children’s risks for autism, ADHD and learning disorders. Adult exposures to methylmercury increase risks for cardiovascular disease and dementia. Manufactured chemicals – phthalates, bisphenol A, flame retardants, and perfluorinated chemicals, many of them released into the seas from plastic waste – can disrupt endocrine signaling, reduce male fertility, damage the nervous system, and increase risk of cancer. HABs produce potent toxins that accumulate in fish and shellfish. When ingested, these toxins can cause severe neurological impairment and rapid death. HAB toxins can also become airborne and cause respiratory disease. Pathogenic marine bacteria cause gastrointestinal diseases and deep wound infections. With climate change and increasing pollution, risk is high that Vibrio infections, including cholera, will increase in frequency and extend to new areas. All of the health impacts of ocean pollution fall disproportionately on vulnerable populations in the Global South – environmental injustice on a planetary scale. Conclusions: Ocean pollution is a global problem. It arises from multiple sources and crosses national boundaries. It is the consequence of reckless, shortsighted, and unsustainable exploitation of the earth’s resources. It endangers marine ecosystems. It impedes the production of atmospheric oxygen. Its threats to human health are great and growing, but still incompletely understood. Its economic costs are only beginning to be counted. Ocean pollution can be prevented. Like all forms of pollution, ocean pollution can be controlled by deploying data-driven strategies based on law, policy, technology, and enforcement that target priority pollution sources. Many countries have used these tools to control air and water pollution and are now applying them to ocean pollution. Successes achieved to date demonstrate that broader control is feasible. Heavily polluted harbors have been cleaned, estuaries rejuvenated, and coral reefs restored. Prevention of ocean pollution creates many benefits. It boosts economies, increases tourism, helps restore fisheries, and improves human health and well-being. It advances the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG). These benefits will last for centuries. Recommendations: World leaders who recognize the gravity of ocean pollution, acknowledge its growing dangers, engage civil society and the global public, and take bold, evidence-based action to stop pollution at source will be critical to preventing ocean pollution and safeguarding human health. Prevention of pollution from land-based sources is key. Eliminating coal combustion and banning all uses of mercury will reduce mercury pollution. Bans on single-use plastic and better management of plastic waste reduce plastic pollution. Bans on persistent organic pollutants (POPs) have reduced pollution by PCBs and DDT. Control of industrial discharges, treatment of sewage, and reduced applications of fertilizers have mitigated coastal pollution and are reducing frequency of HABs. National, regional and international marine pollution control programs that are adequately funded and backed by strong enforcement have been shown to be effective. Robust monitoring is essential to track progress. Further interventions that hold great promise include wide-scale transition to renewable fuels; transition to a circular economy that creates little waste and focuses on equity rather than on endless growth; embracing the principles of green chemistry; and building scientific capacity in all countries. Designation of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) will safeguard critical ecosystems, protect vulnerable fish stocks, and enhance human health and well-being. Creation of MPAs is an important manifestation of national and international commitment to protecting the health of the seas.",http://www.annalsofglobalhealth.org/articles/10.5334/aogh.2831/galley/3144/download/,

In this work, we provide an overview of changes in the mass of the world's glaciers, excluding those in Greenland and Antarctica, between 2002 and 2016, based on satellite gravimetry observations of the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE). Glaciers lost mass at a rate of 199 ± 32 Gt yr −1 during this 14-yr period, equivalent to a cumulative sea level contribution of 8 mm. We present annual mass balances for 17 glacier regions, that show a qualitatively good agreement with published estimates from in situ observations. We find that annual mass balance varies considerably from year to year, which can in part be attributed to changes in the large-scale circulation of the atmosphere. These variations, combined with the relatively short observational record, hamper the detection of acceleration of glacier mass loss. Our study highlights the need for continued observations of the Earth's glacierized regions.",https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/feart.2019.00096/pdf,

The availability of data is a major challenge for hydrological modelling in large parts of the world. Remote sensing data can be exploited to improve models of ungauged or poorly gauged catchments. In this study we combine three datasets for calibration of a rainfall-runoff model of the poorly gauged Okavango catchment in Southern Africa: (i) surface soil moisture (SSM) estimates derived from radar measurements onboard the Envisat satellite; (ii) radar altimetry measurements by Envisat providing river stages in the tributaries of the Okavango catchment, down to a minimum river width of about one hundred meters; and (iii) temporal changes of the Earth's gravity field recorded by the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) caused by total water storage changes in the catchment. The SSM data are shown to be helpful in identifying periods with over-respectively underestimation of the precipitation input. The accuracy of the radar altimetry data is validated on gauged subbasins of the catchment and altimetry data of an ungauged subbasin is used for model calibration. The radar altimetry data are important to condition model parameters related to channel morphology such as Manning's roughness. GRACE data are used to validate the model and to condition model parameters related to various storage compartments in the hydrological model (e.g. soil, groundwater, bank storage etc.). As precipitation input the FEWS-Net RFE, TRMM 3B42 and ECMWF ERA-Interim datasets are considered and compared.",https://hess.copernicus.org/articles/15/1729/2011/hess-15-1729-2011.pdf,

In 1957, man had for the first time propelled his artifacts into the beyond, and he was likely to follow by propelling himself as well. But to desire to depart from the scene of the world, she felt, meant also to think of the world as something worth leaving. To emancipate ourselves from its physical limits—gravity—meant also to emancipate ourselves from the gravity of its existential claims upon us. Sputnik therefore embodied an impulse already much in evidence on Earth—to create an artificial planet. In Sputnik the ambitions of modern man lay revealed.3 These ambitions were ominous. They had also in part been realized. The Human Condition appeared not long after Arendt’s famous study The Origins of Totalitarianism (1951), and she advanced through Sputnik some of the themes broached in that earlier effort. Totalitarianism, it turns out, shared something important with the Russian satellite. Sputnik embodied a desire to fabricate an artificial substitute for the living Earth. Totalitarianism, in turn, distinguished itself from every other form of rule in its ambition to create a new world fit to compete with this one, the nontotalitarian world, and its success was to be measured in the consistency of its artful fiction. Totalitarian regimes create an “artificially fabricated insanity,” and “their art consists in using and at the same time transcending the elements of reality.”4 To-",https://academic.oup.com/ahr/article-pdf/116/3/602/25735542/116-3-602.pdf,

This contribution is not distributed uniformly across the world's oceans due to both oceanographic and gravitational effects. We compute the sea level signature for ice mass fluxes due to changes in the gravity field, Earth's rotation and related effects for the nine year period 2000–2008. Mass loss from Greenland results in a relative sea level (RSL) reduction for much of North Western Europe and Eastern Canada. RSL rise from this source is concentrated around South America. Losses in West Antarctica marginally compensate for this and produce maxima along the coastlines of North America, Australia and Oceania. The combined far-field pattern of wastage from all ice melt sources, is dominated by losses from the ice sheets and results in maxima at latitudes between 20° N and 40° S across the Pacific and Indian Oceans, affecting particularly vulnerable land masses in Oceania. The spatial pattern of RSL variations from ice mass losses used in this study is time-invariant and cumulative. Thus, sea level rise, based on the gravitational effects from the ice losses considered here, will be amplified for this sensitive region.",https://tc.copernicus.org/articles/4/621/2010/tc-4-621-2010.pdf,

As a consequence of these changes, several climate models forecast an intensification of extreme weather events over the upcoming decades, including heat waves and increasingly severe drought and flood episodes. The occurrence of such extreme weather will prompt profound changes in several plant communities, resulting in massive forest dieback events that can trigger a massive loss of biodiversity in several biomes worldwide. Despite the gravity of the situation, our knowledge regarding how extreme weather events can undermine the performance, survival, and distribution of forest species remains very fragmented. Therefore, the present review aimed to provide a broad and integrated perspective of the main biochemical, physiological, and morpho‐anatomical disorders that may compromise the performance and survival of forest species exposed to climate change factors, particularly drought, flooding, and global warming. In addition, we also discuss the controversial effects of high CO2 concentrations in enhancing plant growth and reducing the deleterious effects of some extreme climatic events. We conclude with a discussion about the possible effects that the factors associated with the climate change might have on species distribution and forest composition.",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1002/ece3.5663,

In this work a numerical procedure for the simulation of the construction process of RCC dams is presented. It takes into account the more relevant features of the behavior of concrete at early ages, such as hydration, aging, creep, and damage. A 2D model of the Urugua-iRCC Dam, built in Argentina, is used to perform the corresponding analyses. In this first part only the thermochemical aspects of the simulation of the construction process are presented. The temperature distribution and evolution inside the dam are obtained before and after the completion of the dam. The evolution of the compressive and tensile strengths and elastic moduli and their final distribution inside the dam can also be predicted. Results from 2D and simplified vertical 1D models are compared to assess the validity of the latter, and several parametric studies are carried out. The simulation and discussion of the mechanical aspects of the construction process are relegated to a companion paper that follows. INTRODUCTION AND MOTIVATION During the last 30 years great effort has been made to find an alternative to embankment dams for large gravity construc- tions that would, on one hand, overcome the risk of failure due to overtopping or internal erosion (piping) and, on the other hand, be economically competitive. Currently, the an- swer to this technological challenge is roller compacted con- crete (RCC) dams. RCC is a relatively lean no-slump concrete that can be spread horizontally and compacted using earth- working machinery such as dozers and vibratory rollers. The first evaluations on place-in unit costs for several RCC dams built in the United States showed that these represented sav- ings ranging from 30 to 70% of the cost of conventional con- crete dams (Schrader and Naminas 1988). RCC dam construction has the following features: • The dam body is constructed by placing concrete, in the same placing cycle, over a wide area encompassing sev- eral blocks. • Transverse joints are cut after the placement of concrete. • No longitudinal joints are made. • Pipe cooling is not (generally) used.",https://www.scipedia.com/wd/images/1/1b/Draft_Samper_985589073_8735_2000-ASCE-StructEng-RCC-I-on.pdf,

The primary goal of the Gravity Recovery And Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite mission (2002–2017) and its follow-on mission (GRACE-FO, 2018–onward) is to provide time-variable gravity fields, which can be converted to TWSCs with ∼ 300 km spatial resolution; however, the one year data gap between GRACE and GRACE-FO represents a critical discontinuity, which cannot be replaced by alternative data or model with the same quality. To fill this gap, we applied time-variable gravity fields (2013–onward) from the Swarm Earth explorer mission with low spatial resolution of ∼ 1500 km. A novel iterative reconstruction approach was formulated based on the independent component analysis (ICA) that combines the GRACE and Swarm fields. The reconstructed TWSC fields of 2003–2018 were compared with a commonly applied reconstruction technique and GRACE-FO TWSC fields, whose results indicate a considerable noise reduction and long-term consistency improvement of the iterative ICA reconstruction technique. They were applied to evaluate trends and seasonal mass changes (of 2003–2018) within the world’s 33 largest river basins.",https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/12/10/1639/pdf?version=1590669296,

However, it is widely speculated that the brain transforms these signals into an allocentric, gravity-centered representation of the world that is stable and independent of the observer's spatial pose. Where and how this representation may be achieved is currently unknown. Here we demonstrate that a subpopulation of neurons in the macaque caudal intraparietal area (CIP) visually encodes object tilt in nonegocentric coordinates defined relative to the gravitational vector. Neuronal responses to the tilt of a visually presented planar surface were measured with the monkey in different spatial orientations (upright and rolled left/right ear down) and then compared. This revealed a continuum of representations in which planar tilt was encoded in a gravity-centered reference frame in approximately one-tenth of the comparisons, intermediate reference frames ranging between gravity-centered and egocentric in approximately two-tenths of the comparisons, and in an egocentric reference frame in less than half of the comparisons. Altogether, almost half of the comparisons revealed a shift in the preferred tilt and/or a gain change consistent with encoding object orientation in nonegocentric coordinates. Through neural network modeling, we further show that a purely gravity-centered representation of object tilt can be achieved directly from the population activity of CIP-like units. These results suggest that area CIP may play a key role in creating a stable, allocentric representation of the environment defined relative to an “earth-vertical” direction.",https://www.jneurosci.org/content/jneuro/34/43/14170.full.pdf,

Nevertheless, some interesting facts emerge. Russian scientists have been conducting experiments into the effects of space flight upon living organisms for nearly a decade. Initially, animals in hermetically sealedcabins were sent by rocket to heights between 100 and 210 kilometres, and the cabins returned to earth by parachute. Instruments were included to record changes in the animals' breathing, blood pressure and temperature, and other data, and no considerable changes were noted as the result of the initial acceleration, the gravity-free interlude at the summit of the trajectory, or the deceleration when the parachutereturned to the Earth's atmosphere. The animals seemednone the worse for their experiences, and some survived two such journeys. The stage was now set for Laika's satellite voyage, a voyage which was the only means by which the effects of zero gravity and of primary cosmic radiation could be studied under the conditions of space flight. Transmitters relayed information about Lalka's pulse and respiration rate, and even an electrocardiographictracing. The critical momentsof the flight were the launchingand the putting into orbit. Good recordings were received of the events at the moment of putting into orbit. The pulse rate increased to three times and the respiration rate to between three and four times the initial rate, but the electrocardiogram showed no serious changes. In Kousnetzov's words, ""There is every reason to believe that the changes noticed in the physiological functions of the animal were brought about by the sudden effect upon the latter of external irritants: acceleration,noise and vibration"". However, the pulse and respiration rates took three times as long to return to normal as in corresponding laboratory tests. This was interpreted as being due to the fact that, whereasin the laboratory tests, once acceleration ceased, the animal found itself under normal conditions, in the sputnik accelerationwas followed by a complete absence of gravity. Again to quote Kousnetzov, ""The absence of signals from the receptive organs as to the position of the body in space caused a change in the functional state of the nervoussystemwhich regulatesthe blood circulation and breathing . . . "". It seems fair to interpret these statementsas meaning that the dog was utterly terrified by the suddenacceleration,accompaniedby a tremendous outburst of noise and vibration, which accompaniedthe ""going into orbit"", and that when the accelerationand noise had died away the strange experienceof weightlessnesspreventeda quick return of confldence.However, the animal did not appear to have suffered any physical harm, and apparentlysurvived in a normal physiological state until the supply of oxygen failed. It was not possible to draw any conclusions as to the effects of cosmic radiation.",https://pmj.bmj.com/content/postgradmedj/35/404/367.3.full.pdf,

Groundwater is the largest store of freshwater on Earth after the cryosphere and provides a substantial proportion of the water used for domestic, irrigation and industrial purposes. Knowledge of this essential resource remains incomplete, in part, because of observational challenges of scale and accessibility. Here we examine a 14-year period (2002–2016) of Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) observations to investigate climate–groundwater dynamics of 14 tropical and sub-tropical aquifers selected from WHYMAP's (Worldwide Hydrogeological Mapping and Assessment Programme) 37 large aquifer systems of the world. GRACE-derived changes in groundwater storage resolved using GRACE Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) mascons and the Community Land Model's land surface model are related to precipitation time series and regional-scale hydrogeology. We show that aquifers in dryland environments exhibit long-term hydraulic memory through a strong correlation between groundwater storage changes and annual precipitation anomalies integrated over the time series; aquifers in humid environments show short-term memory through strong correlation with monthly precipitation. This classification is consistent with estimates of groundwater response times calculated from the hydrogeological properties of each system, with long (short) hydraulic memory associated with slow (rapid) response times. The results suggest that groundwater systems in dryland environments may be less sensitive to seasonal climate variability but vulnerable to long-term trends from which they will be slow to recover. In contrast, aquifers in humid regions may be more sensitive to climate disturbances such as drought related to the El Niño–Southern Oscillation but may also be relatively quick to recover. Exceptions to this general pattern are traced to human interventions through groundwater abstraction. Hydraulic memory is an important factor in the management of groundwater resources, particularly under climate change.",https://esd.copernicus.org/articles/11/775/2020/esd-11-775-2020.pdf,

Since large parts of the world are not yet sufficiently covered by seismic surveys, products from the Earth’s satellite observation systems have more often been used for this purpose in recent years. In this study we use the gravity-gradient data derived from the Gravity field and steady-state Ocean Circulation Explorer (GOCE), the elevation data from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) and other global datasets to determine the Moho density contrast at the study area which comprises most of the Eurasian plate (including parts of surrounding continental and oceanic tectonic plates). A regional Moho recovery is realized by solving the Vening Meinesz-Moritz’s (VMM) inverse problem of isostasy and a seismic crustal model is applied to constrain the gravimetric solution. Our results reveal that the Moho density contrast reaches minima along the mid-oceanic rift zones and maxima under the continental crust. This spatial pattern closely agrees with that seen in the CRUST1.0 seismic crustal model as well as in the KTH1.0 gravimetric-seismic Moho model. However, these results differ considerably from some previously published gravimetric studies. In particular, we demonstrate that there is no significant spatial correlation between the Moho density contrast and Moho deepening under major orogens of Himalaya and Tibet. In fact, the Moho density contrast under most of the continental crustal structure is typically much more uniform.",https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/8/5/418/pdf?version=1463473890,

Limited availability of ground measurements in the vast majority of river basins world-wide increases the value of alternative data sources such as satellite observations in hydrological modelling. This study investigates the potential of using remotely sensed river water levels, i.e. altimetry observations, from multiple satellite missions to identify parameter sets for a hydrological model in the semi-arid Luangwa River basin in Zambia. A distributed process-based rainfall–runoff model with sub-grid process heterogeneity was developed and run on a daily timescale for the time period 2002 to 2016. As a benchmark, feasible model parameter sets were identified using traditional model calibration with observed river discharge data. For the parameter identification using remote sensing, data from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) were used in a first step to restrict the feasible parameter sets based on the seasonal fluctuations in total water storage. Next, three alternative ways of further restricting feasible model parameter sets using satellite altimetry time series from 18 different locations along the river were compared. In the calibrated benchmark case, daily river flows were reproduced relatively well with an optimum Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency of ENS,Q=0.78 (5/95th percentiles of all feasible solutions ENS,Q,5/95=0.61–0.75). When using only GRACE observations to restrict the parameter space, assuming no discharge observations are available, an optimum of ENS,Q=-1.4 (ENS,Q,5/95=-2.3–0.38) with respect to discharge was obtained. The direct use of altimetry-based river levels frequently led to overestimated flows and poorly identified feasible parameter sets (ENS,Q,5/95=-2.9–0.10). Similarly, converting modelled discharge into water levels using rating curves in the form of power relationships with two additional free calibration parameters per virtual station resulted in an overestimation of the discharge and poorly identified feasible parameter sets (ENS,Q,5/95=-2.6–0.25). However, accounting for river geometry proved to be highly effective. This included using river cross-section and gradient information extracted from global high-resolution terrain data available on Google Earth and applying the Strickler–Manning equation to convert modelled discharge into water levels. Many parameter sets identified with this method reproduced the hydrograph and multiple other signatures of discharge reasonably well, with an optimum of ENS,Q=0.60 (ENS,Q,5/95=-0.31–0.50). It was further shown that more accurate river cross-section data improved the water-level simulations, modelled rating curve, and discharge simulations during intermediate and low flows at the basin outlet where detailed on-site cross-section information was available. Also, increasing the number of virtual stations used for parameter selection in the calibration period considerably improved the model performance in a spatial split-sample validation. The results provide robust evidence that in the absence of directly observed discharge data for larger rivers in data-scarce regions, altimetry data from multiple virtual stations combined with GRACE observations have the potential to fill this gap when combined with readily available estimates of river geometry, thereby allowing a step towards more reliable hydrological modelling in poorly gauged or ungauged basins.",https://hess.copernicus.org/articles/24/3331/2020/hess-24-3331-2020.pdf,

Here we examine the role of mechanical stability in limiting tree height and focus on trees from the tallest tropical forests on Earth, in Sabah, Malaysian Borneo, including the recently discovered tallest tropical tree, a 100.8 m Shorea faguetiana. We use terrestrial laser scans, in situ strain gauge data and finite-element simulations to map the architecture of tall broadleaf trees and monitor their response to wind loading. We demonstrate that a tree’s risk of breaking due to gravity or self-weight decreases with tree height and is much more strongly affected by tree architecture than by material properties. In contrast, wind damage risk increases with tree height despite the larger diameters of tall trees, resulting in a U-shaped curve of mechanical risk with tree height. The relative rarity of extreme wind speeds in north Borneo may be the reason it is home to the tallest trees in the tropics.",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1111/btp.12850,

This requires to re-encode head kinematic signals into a reference frame anchored to earth-centered landmarks such as gravity, through computations whose neuronal substrate remains to be determined. Here, we studied the encoding of self-generated head movements in the caudal cerebellar vermis, an area essential for graviceptive functions. We found that, contrarily to peripheral vestibular inputs, most Purkinje cells exhibited a mixed sensitivity to head rotational and gravitational information and were differentially modulated by active and passive movements. In a subpopulation of cells, this mixed sensitivity underlay a tuning to rotations about an axis defined relative to gravity. Therefore, we show that the caudal vermis hosts a re-encoded, gravitationally-polarized representation of self-generated head kinematics.",https://doi.org/10.7554/elife.26179,

However, one of the biggest challenges for researchers is the problem of supplying energy to UAVs to ensure they can operate for a longer time. Especially in the case of rotary wings, they consume more energy than other UAV types as the motors need to spend a lot of energy to operate in order to overcome the gravity of the earth. The article aims to research power supply, energy consumption on UAVs, and a method of taking advantage of external energy sources to provide power for the operation of UAVs and discuss UAVs’ structure, categories, and control. Two experiments were conducted separately to evaluate the energy consumption of UAVs and the energy conversion from external energy sources to electrical energy. A test bench was designed to evaluate and determine the maximum efficiency using regenerative braking mode. The measuring device was manufactured to measure the necessary parameters to calculate the energy consumption and performance of the system. Experimental numerical results show that energy conversion from external sources is one of methods that can help increase the flight time of the UAV.",https://www.mdpi.com/2226-4310/9/9/500/pdf?version=1663559690,

By means of in situ observations and remote sensing, PROMICE assesses how much mass is gained as snow accumulation on the surface versus how much is lost by iceberg calving and surface ablation (Ahlstrom et al. 2008). A key element of PROMICE is a network of automatic weather stations (AWSs) designed to quantify components of the surface mass balance, including the energy exchanges contributing to surface ablation (Van As et al. 2013).The use of these AWS observations is not limited to studies of ice-sheet mass balance. PROMICE contributes to CryoNet (www.globalcryospherewatch.org/cryonet), the core network of surface measurement sites of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) Global Cryosphere Watch. By real-time delivery through WMO, PROMICE observations contribute to improve both operational forecasting and climate analysis in the data-sparse Arctic. The Greenlandic population, highly dependent on accurate forecasting of weather conditions, benefits directly from these real-time observations. For instance, extreme surface wind speeds are a high-risk element in Greenland. The third-highest wind speed observed at the surface of the Earth (93 m/s or 333 km/h), was recorded in a 8–9 March 1972 storm at Thule in North-West Greenland (Stansfield 1972).In this paper, we discuss the extent to which the Greenland ice sheet generates its own near-surface wind field. We use PROMICE data to gain insight into the interaction between air temperature, radiation and gravity-driven katabatic winds. We focus on a particularly powerful spring storm in 2013 that contributed to a fatality on an ice-sheet ski traverse attempt (Linden 2013).",https://geusbulletin.org/index.php/geusb/article/download/4669/10321,

The average spacing of the stations in the present survey is about 7km apart. A new Free-air gravity anomaly map has been constructed based on these values. The map is dominated by a NNE-SSW gravity high trend with a maximum value of 300 mgal, that follows closely the Central Range, a folded and faulted mountain belt with many peaks 3000m or higher. The magnitude of the Free-airanomaly in the Taiwan area is quite large compared to that elsewhere in the world. The good correlation between the Free-air anomaly and elevation suggests that the Taiwan area is not in isostatic equilibrium. An average surface rock density of 2.57gcm^(-3) is estimated from the Free-air gravity data by using the least-squares method. This value can be used for both terrain and Bouguer corrections. The undulation of the geoid and the deflections of the vertical in the Taiwan area are also calculated by using the Free-air anomaly data. The geoid undulation is not rugged over the Taiwan area. The maximum difference is about 5m. And the deflection of the vertical seems mainly to be affected by both land and submarine topographies.",http://tao.cgu.org.tw/index.php/articles/archive/geophysics/item/download/8_7a28a9cdbd057f1526de1817f0f3197d,

The CPD and magnetic data were used to map the depth to the bottom of the magnetic layer by calculating the depth to the Curie isotherm (540°C) beneath Hawaii Island. The spectral peak method was used to calculate the depths to the shallow and deep magnetic sources for the entire island, and the CPD was calculated using the centroid method. A two-dimensional density model for two Earth layers was constructed using forward modeling of the gravity data. A large plume of dense intrusive material was observed beneath the three adjacent volcanoes of Mauna Loa, Mauna Kea, and Kilauea, and two small chambers were found to be located beneath the Kohala and Hualalai volcanoes. Based on the gravity modeling results, the depth to the magma layer varied from 0.5 to 10 km, and the heat flow was higher close to the volcanic eruption zones. The current study is informative and cost effective for the world’s most active volcanic areas.",https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/feart.2022.847984/pdf,

A number of studies have used multisource remote sensing data to conduct research on oil palms in Malaysia, but there are a lack of long-term oil palm mapping studies, especially when the percentage of oil palm tree cover was higher than other plantations in Malaysia during the period of 2000–2012. To overcome this limitation, we used the Google Earth Engine platform to perform oil palm classification based on Landsat reflectance data. The spatial distribution of oil palms in Malaysia in five periods from 2000 to 2018 was obtained. Then, the planting center of gravity transfer method was applied to analyze the expansion of oil palms in Malaysia from 2000 to 2018 using Landsat data, elevation data, oil palm planting area, crude palm oil price, and other statistical data. Meanwhile, the driving factors affecting the change in oil palm planting area were also analyzed. The results showed that: (1) During 2000–2018, the oil palm planted area in Malaysia increased by 5.06 Mha (million ha), with a growth rate of 83.50%. Specifically, the increased area and growth rate for West Malaysia were 2.05 Mha and 62.05% and for East Malaysia were 3.01 Mha and 109.45%, respectively. (2) Three expansion patterns of oil palms were observed: (i) from a fragmented pattern to a connected area, (ii) expansion along a river, and (iii) from a plain to a gently sloped area. (3) The maximum shift of the center of gravity of the oil palms in West Malaysia was 10 km, while in East Malaysia, it reached 100 km. The East Malaysia oil palm planting potential was greater than that of West Malaysia and showed a trend of shifting from coastal areas to inland areas. (4) Malaysia’s oil palms are mainly planted in areas below 100 m above sea level; although a trend of expansion into high altitudes is visible, oil palm plantings extend to areas below 300 m above sea level. (5) Topography, crude palm oil prices, and deforestation are closely related to changes in oil palm planted area.",https://www.mdpi.com/2220-9964/9/4/280/pdf,

Special consideration was given to scientific manuscripts that covered, but were not limited to, the development of geospatial techniques and remote sensing applications for detecting, quantifying, and monitoring freshwater water resources, identifying potential threats to water resources and agriculture, as well as other themes related to water resources and environmental management at various spatial scales. The Special Issue attracted over thirteen peer-reviewed scientific articles, with the majority of manuscripts originating from China. Most of the studies made use of satellite datasets, ranging from coarse spatial resolution data, such as the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) and GRACE Follow-On (GRACE-FO), to medium spatial resolution data, such as the Landsat series, ERA5, Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Application Land version 2 reanalysis product (MERRA2), CLSM and NOAH ET, and MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer). Google Earth Engine (GEE) data, together with big data processing techniques, such as the remote sensing-based energy balance model (ALEXI/DisALEXI approach) and the STARFM data fusion technique, were used for analyzing geospatial datasets. Overall, this Special Issue demonstrated significant knowledge gaps in various big data image processing techniques and improved computing processes in assessing and monitoring water resources and the environment at various spatial and temporal scales.",https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/15/1/18/pdf?version=1671615482,

Significant changes of the total water storage (TWS) might be detectable by satellite-based data provided by the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) mission. To detect these store water changes, effects of other factors are to be removed first from these data due to band-limited representation of near-surface mass changes from GRACE. Here, we evaluated three current popular land surface models (LSMs) basing on in situ measurements and found that the WaterGAP Global Hydrology Model (WGHM) demonstrates higher correlation than other analyzed models with the in-situ rainfall measurement. Then we used the WGHM outputs to remove climate-induced TWS changes, such as surface water storage, soil, canopy, snow, and groundwater storage. The residual results (GRACE minus WGHM) indicated a strong trend (3.85 ± 2 km3/yr) that is significantly higher than the TGR analysis and hindcast experiments (2.29 ± 1 km3/yr) based on in-situ water level measurements. We also estimated the seepage response to the TGR filling, contributions from other anthropogenic dams, and used in-situ gravity and GPS observations to evaluate dominant factors responsible for the GRACE-based overestimate of the TGR volume change. We found that the modeled seepage variability through coarse-grained materials explained most of the difference between the GRACE based estimate of TGR volume changes and in situ measurements, but the agreement with in-situ gravity observations is considerably lower. In contrast, the leakage contribution from 13 adjacent reservoirs explained ~74% of the TGR volume change derived from GRACE and WGHM. Our results demonstrate that GRACE-based overestimate TGR mass change mainly from the contribution of surrounding artificial reservoirs and underestimated TWS variations in WGHM simulations due to the large uncertainty of WGHM in groundwater component. In additional, this study also indicates that reservoir or lake volume changes can be reliably derived from GRACE data when they are used in combination with relevant complementary observations.",https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/11/1/99/pdf?version=1546963166,

Surface currents are poorly known over most of the world's oceans. Satellite-borne Doppler wave and current scatterometers (DWaCSs) are among the proposed techniques to fill this observation gap. The Sea surface KInematics Multiscale (SKIM) proposal is the first satellite concept built on a DWaCS design at near-nadir angles and was demonstrated to be technically feasible as part of the European Space Agency Earth Explorer program. This article describes preliminary results from a field experiment performed in November 2018 off the French Atlantic coast, with sea states representative of the open ocean and a well-known tide-dominated current regime, as part of the detailed design and feasibility studies for SKIM. This experiment comprised airborne measurements performed using Ku-band and Ka-band Doppler radars looking at the sea surface at near-nadir incidence in a real-aperture mode, i.e., in a geometry and mode similar to that of SKIM, as well as an extensive set of in situ instruments. The Ku-band Radar for Observation of Surfaces (KuROS) airborne radar provided simultaneous measurements of the radar backscatter and Doppler velocity in a side-looking configuration, with a horizontal resolution of about 5 to 10 m along the line of sight and integrated in the perpendicular direction over the real-aperture 3 dB footprint diameter (about 580 m). The Ka-band RADar for Ocean Current (KaRADOC) system, also operating in the side-looking configuration, had a much narrower beam, with a circular footprint only 45 m in diameter. Results are reported for two days with contrasting conditions, a strong breeze on 22 November 2018 (wind speed 11.5 m s−1, Hs 2.6 m) and gentle breeze on 24 November 2018 (wind speed 5.5 m s−1, Hs 1.7 m). The measured line-of-sight velocity signal is analyzed to separate a non-geophysical contribution linked to the aircraft velocity, a geophysical contribution due to the intrinsic motion of surface waves and the desired surface current contribution. The surface wave contribution is found to be well predicted by Kirchhoff scattering theory using as input parameters in situ measurements of the directional spectrum of long waves, complemented by the short wave spectrum of Elfouhaily et al. (1997). It is found to be closely aligned with the wind direction, with small corrections due to the presence of swell. Its norm is found to be weakly variable with wind speed and sea state, quite stable and close to C0=2.0ms-1 at the Ka band, and more variable and close to C0=2.4ms-1 at the Ku band. These values are 10 %–20 % smaller than previous theoretical estimates. The directional spread of the short gravity waves is found to have a marked influence on this surface wave contribution. Overall, the results of this study support the feasibility of near-nadir radar Doppler remote sensing of the ocean total surface current velocity (TSCV).",https://os.copernicus.org/articles/16/1399/2020/os-16-1399-2020.pdf,

The disturbance of the heat balance along the supersonic travel of the trajectory of the Moon’s shadow could generate gravity waves during solar eclipse, which results a reduction in the concentration of ozone layer in the stratosphere. We, in this context, conducted some experiments to detect the possible radiations reaching the surface of the earth and the impact of such radiation in seawater during the recent total and annular solar eclipses. This is the first time that the variation in pH value of seawater during solar eclipse is examined, and the experimental data demonstrated that the solar eclipse phenomenon affects the pH value of seawater due to the shorter wavelength radiations received on the surface of the earth. The reduction is around 20% and 40% of the difference between ordinary water and seawater during total and annular eclipses respectively.

This can be attributed to the remarkable discovery of new states of (soft) matter - the liquid and crystalline plasmas - in 1994. Following this discovery, many researchers throughout the world decided to explore and investigate the new physics that was beckoning. Now the field produces about one scientific publication per day, many links to other disciplines are being forged (e.g. colloid physics, solid state, granular media, environmental research, etc) and application potentials are under investigation, too (e.g. nanostructured materials, plasma cleaning devices, adaptive electrodes, particle manipulation and modification, etc). The young field of complex (dusty) plasmas is beginning to come of age. This seemed like an excellent time to produce a Focus Issue on the topic. Through the diversity of the contributions the reader is able to get a synoptic view of the field which, of course, a review article cannot provide. The papers cover basic aspects of dust-plasma interactions in the laboratory, under microgravity conditions and in space, as well as the application of plasma-processed micro-particles. The contributions focus on the latest scientific advances in complex plasmas. Judging from the huge response to the announcement of the Focus Issue in New Journal of Physics, we, the editors, conclude that the field is still growing and that the timing for the Focus Issue is just right! We would like to express our appreciation to Alexander Bradshaw who initiated this Focus Issue. Finally, we wish to thank the editorial team, especially Tim Smith, the many referees and the contributors for their excellent work.

Nevertheless, the remoteness of this part of the world still considerably limits the use of seismic data. A possible way to overcome this practical restriction partially is to use products from the Earth’s satellite observation systems. Global topographic data are provided by the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM). Global gravitational models have been derived from observables delivered by the gravity-dedicated satellite missions, such as the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) and the Gravity field and steady-state Ocean Circulation Explorer (GOCE). Optimally, the topographic and gravity data should be combined with available results from tomographic surveys to interpret the lithospheric structure, including also a Moho relief. In this study, we use seismic, gravity, and topographic data to estimate the Moho depth under orogenic structures of the Himalayas and Tibet. The combined Moho model is computed based on solving the Vening Meinesz–Moritz (VMM) inverse problem of isostasy, while incorporating seismic data to constrain the gravimetric solution. The result of the combined gravimetric-seismic data analysis exhibits an anticipated more detailed structure of the Moho geometry when compared to the solution obtained merely from seismic data. This is especially evident over regions with sparse seismic data coverage. The newly-determined combined Moho model of Tibet shows a typical contrast between a thick crustal structure of orogenic formations compared to a thinner crust of continental basins. The Moho depth under most of the Himalayas and the Tibetan Plateau is typically within 60–70 km. The maximum Moho deepening of ~76 km occurs to the south of the Bangong-Nujiang suture under the Lhasa terrane. Local maxima of the Moho depth to ~74 km are also found beneath Taksha at the Karakoram fault. This Moho pattern generally agrees with the findings from existing gravimetric and seismic studies, but some inconsistencies are also identified and discussed in this study.",https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3263/8/12/461/pdf?version=1544004395,

Recent numerical studies based on newly developed theoretical models, however, indicate that the computation of this correction using the approximate formula yields large errors especially in mountainous regions with computation points at high elevations. In this study we investigate these approximation errors at the study area which comprises Himalayas and Tibet where this correction reaches global maxima. Since the GPS-leveling and terrestrial gravity datasets in this part of the world are not (freely) available, global gravitational models (GGMs) are used to compute this correction utilizing the expressions for a spherical harmonic analysis of the gravity field. The computation of this correction can be done using the GGM coefficients taken from the Earth Gravitational Model 2008 (EGM08) complete to degree 2160 of spherical harmonics. The recent studies based on a regional accuracy assessment of GGMs have shown that the combined GRACE/GOCE solutions provide a substantial improvement of the Earth’s gravity field at medium wavelengths of spherical harmonics compared to EGM08. We address this aspect in numerical analysis by comparing the gravity field quantities computed using the satellite-only combined GRACE/GOCE model GOCO02S against the EGM08 results. The numerical results reveal that errors in the geoid-to-quasigeoid correction computed using the approximate formula can reach as much as ~1.5 m. We also demonstrate that the expected improvement of the GOCO02S gravity field quantities at medium wavelengths (within the frequency band approximately between 100 and 250) compared to EGM08 is as much as ±60 mGal and ±0.2 m in terms of gravity anomalies and geoid/quasigeoid heights respectively.",http://tao.cgu.org.tw/index.php/articles/archive/geology/item/download/1111_bd5f295667c1572295acc71e6c94469d,

The entire Plateau has been undergoing crustal deformation and accompanying isostatic uplift as a result of the Cenozoic collision of the Indian and Eurasian continents. Regional secular surface mass changes include the melting of mountain glaciers and ice caps, and permafrost layer degradation due to global warming. There is also a plausible effect of glacial isostatic adjustment due to the removal of a possible Pleistocene ice-sheet. In this article, we present an assessment of the sizes and extents of these competing interior and exterior dynamical processes, and their possible detections using contemporary space geodetic techniques. These techniques include, in addition to GPS, satellite radar altimetry over land, and temporal gravity field measurements from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite mission. These techniques are complementary: land satellite altimetry, similar to GPS, is sensitive only to surface uplift, whereas GRACE is sensitive to both surface uplift and mass changes inside the Earth. Each process may dominate the others in a particular region. Our analysis shows that GRACE data are more sensitive (than GPS or land altimetry) to hydrologic and meteorology signals, some of which are larger than the combined effect of geodynamic processes and permafrost degradation.",http://tao.cgu.org.tw/index.php/articles/archive/atmospheric-science/item/download/2372_a99e53fa65f8bf1253bd6546955f2ad5,

Universal gravitation and Earth rotation are important sources of the Earth’s gravity and geomagnetic fields, which are well known to us. After years of long-term observation, global research, and analysis, it was discovered that we have neglected a direct incident energy of the universe on the Earth. Solar radiation, leading to energy exchange from the atmosphere 100 km above the land surface, is the energy source of the Earth. Polarization is one of the four basic physical properties of solar radiation. After the solar radiation reaches the surface of these media, it reflects, scatters or refracts, and exhibits different degrees of polarization. The polarized solar light forms the Earth–sky polarization vector field. The polarized light dispersion is expected to become a new method for global analysis of the human environment. Polarization detection is the best way to accurately explore the atmospheric effects. Local polarized skylight distribution was found in different sites in the world; however, the global distribution of the polarized sunlight radiation has never been explored. In this paper, we investigate the Global Skylight Polarization Field. This study aimed at providing new insight into the laws of polarization over our Earth. We use a Rayleigh scattering model to obtain the simulation results of the sky polarization field. Rayleigh scattering occurs when the particle size is much smaller than the wavelength of the incident electromagnetic wave. We also use a polarized fisheye camera to collect the sky polarization image and calculate the distribution pattern of the DOLP (degree of linear polarization) and AOLP (azimuth of linear polarization) of the skylight. The stability and gradual change in the degree of polarization in the zenith direction are verified, and the distribution law and daily change law of the degree of polarization in the sky are obtained. With the increase in the solar altitude angle, the degree of polarization will decrease. We also observed the skylight polarization in different weather conditions. Our results demonstrate the physical basis, characteristics, and usability of the polarization field. They show an inevitable trend from optical remote sensing to polarization remote sensing.",https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/14/9/2193/pdf?version=1651724243,

Their aim is to address decision-making problems in the real world whenever obtaining accurate and sufficient data is not a straightforward task. In this way, spherical fuzzy sets were recently introduced as a step beyond to modelize such problems more precisely on the basis of the human nature, thus expanding the space of membership levels, which are defined under imprecise circumstances. The main goal in this study is to apply the spherical fuzzy set version of Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS), a well-established multicriteria decision-making approach, in the context of planetary defense. As of the extraction of knowledge from a group of experts in the field of near-Earth asteroids, they rated four deflection technologies of asteroids (kinetic impactor, ion beam deflection, enhanced gravity tractor, and laser ablation) that had been previously assessed by means of the classical theory of fuzzy series. This way, a comparative study was carried out whose most significant results are the kinetic impactor being the most suitable alternative and the spherical fuzzy set version of the TOPSIS approach behaves more sensitively than the TOPSIS procedure for triangular fuzzy sets with regard to the information provided by our group of experts.",https://downloads.hindawi.com/journals/aa/2021/6678056.pdf,

However, observations of modulated wave and flow fields which are needed for quantitative understanding of the interhemispheric coupling are not sufficient. Simultaneous observations of gravity waves at various locations are most important because they are a main driver of the Lagrangian mean flow in the mesosphere. With the start of full system observation by the PANSY radar in the Antarctic in March 2015, a global mesosphere-stratosphere-troposphere (MST) radar network extending from the Arctic to the Antarctic has been realized. The MST radars are able to observe wind vectors with fine temporal and vertical resolutions including vertical wind components in the troposphere, stratosphere and mesosphere, although an observational gap of the middle and upper stratosphere remains. Thus, the characteristics of small-scale or short-period wave motions including gravity waves and the momentum fluxes associated with these waves can be estimated with a good accuracy. In addition, recent high-resolution general circulation models enable an explicit simulation of gravity waves under ideal and/or climatological boundary conditions and allow us to examine the momentum budget in the MST region including gravity waves, although their resolution is currently not sufficient to resolve the entire gravity wave spectrum. Real atmosphere simulations utilizing such high-resolution models are still a challenge for the MST region. However, if such real atmosphere simulations are successful, they will help quantitative interpretation of the dynamical fields observed by the MST radar network, and the observations will provide invaluable validation data for the model improvement. Therefore we will examine the interhemispheric coupling of the earth atmosphere through a combination of simultaneous observations by networking the MST radars over the world and high-resolution model simulations of the observed atmosphere. This is an official project, ICSOM, for SCOSTEP, but it is closely related to SPARC. The first international observation campaign was successfully performed during a time period from 22 January-17 February, 2016 when two minor warming occurred in the Arctic stratosphere. Seven MST radars and many other radars and optical instruments providing complementary observational data were operated. More than 30 scientists in eight countries are participated in this project. A preliminary result from this observation campaign will be presented.",https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/sola/12/0/12_2016-026/_pdf,

However, the mechanism of appearance of the information molecules (ribozymes/RNA) accompanying that process, considered obligatory for Darwinian evolution, is unclear. We propose a novel scenario of self-sustained Darwinian evolution of the liposomes driven by ever-present natural phenomena: solar UV radiation, day/night cycle, gravity, and the formation of liposomes in an aqueous media. The central tenet of this scenario is the liposomes' encapsulation of the heavy solutes, followed by their gravitational submerging in the water. The submerged liposomes, being protected from the damaging UV radiation, acquire the longevity necessary for autocatalytic replication of amphiphiles, their mutation, and the selection of those amphiphilic assemblies that provide the greatest membrane stability. These two sets of adaptive compositional information (heavy content and amphiphilic assemblies design) generate a population of liposomes with self-replication/reproduction properties, which are amendable to mutation, inheritance, and selection, thereby establishing Darwinian progression. Temporary and spatial expansion of this liposomal population will provide the basis for the next evolutionary step—a transition of accidentally entrapped RNA precursor molecules into complex functional molecules, such as ribozymes/RNA.",https://doi.org/10.1089/ast.2021.0161,

Atomic Absorbtion Spectrometric(AAS) analyses of samples of Ikere -Ekit i Kaolin and clay, Ile-Ife clay and Iwo Kaolin was done. AAS analyses showed Iwo Kao lin and Ile -ife clay having lo w alu mina and high impurity contents making them low refractory. Init ial tests confirmed its low refractoriness as Iwo Kao lin could not withstand the bisque firing at 900℃ cracking extensively. Thus Ile-ife clay and Iwo Kaolin were disqualified as candidate materials for electrical porcelain production. Ikere-Ekiti kao lin and clay found to be high in alu mina content and having low impurity contents were used in the experimental production. Results showed Ikere -Ekiti kaolin and clay suitable for porcelain pro- duction. Values of standard refractory tests fell with in standard values for porcelain production. Kaolin is commercial clay co mposed principally of the hydrated aluminosilicate clay mineral kaolinite. The co m- mercial value of kaolin is based on the mineral""s whiteness and fineness, but controllable part icle size wh ich may be optimized during processing. Particle size affects fluid ity, strength, plasticity, colour, abrasiveness and ease of disper- sion. Other important properties include the flat particle shape, which increases opacity and hiding power, its soft and non abrasive texture, due to the absence of coarser impurities, an its chemical inertness. These key properties distinguish kaolin fro m other kaolin itic clays like ball clay and fireclay. The kaolinite content of processed grades of kaolin varies, but is generally in the range of 75% to 94%. Associated minerals may have considerable influence on the suitability of the clay for a particular application. Kao lin fro m different parts of the world have markedly different properties.

The eruption generated strong acoustic-gravity waves in the near-field and stations all over the world recorded Lamb waves (LW) that travelled around the earth multiple times at a speed of ~0.3 km/s. Here we report ionospheric anomalies due to the LW over Indonesian islands, 5000–10,000 km away from the volcano, in terms of changes in total electron contents (TEC) using the nationwide network of GNSS stations. We detected ionospheric anomalies travelling above Indonesia several times both westward and eastward. The first passage of LW over Java caused strong TEC increases of >12 TECU. The wave circled the earth and returned to Java on subsequent days. The second passage was recorded early 1/17, the anomaly decayed to 6 TECU. We also detected the passage of long-path waves propagating from west to east. In addition to such anomalies, we examined the existence of ionospheric disturbances apparently propagating from the geomagnetic conjugate point of the volcano that could possibly emerge in Indonesia.

The availability of data is a major challenge for hydrological modelling in large parts of the world. Remote sensing data can be exploited to improve models of ungauged or poorly gauged catchments. In this study we combine three datasets for calibration of a rainfall-runoff model of the poorly gauged Okavango catchment in Southern Africa: (i) surface soil moisture (SSM) estimates derived from radar measurements onboard the Envisat satellite; (ii) radar altimetry measurements by Envisat providing river stages in the tributaries of the Okavango catchment, down to a minimum river width of about one hundred meters; and (iii) temporal changes of the Earth’s gravity ﬁeld recorded by the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) caused by total water storage changes in the catchment. The SSM data are shown to be helpful in identifying periods with over-respectively underestimation of the precipitation input. The accuracy of the radar altimetry data is validated on gauged subbasins of the catchment and altimetry data of an ungauged subbasin is used for model calibration. The radar altimetry data are important to condition model parameters related to channel morphology such as Manning’s roughness. GRACE data are used to validate",https://hess.copernicus.org/articles/15/1729/2011/hess-15-1729-2011.pdf,

It tracks the attitude (with heading angle being the most important part) of the device in real time and provides positioning services for users based on the information of step length provided by Pedestrian Dead-Reckon (PDR), which is a cheap and efficient positioning method at present. However, amid a train of positioning methods, the joint estimate of tracking is given by a train of methods based on the direction of gravity and the earths magnetic field direction. Considering the measurement of gravity that the gravity accelerometer is exposed to heavy noise due to the complex movement of human body during walking with uniform swing arm posture and forward speed, this paper proposed a novel estimate method based on the Kalman filter with multi-state constraints and the usage of low-cost sensors, which fulfills the estimation with the sequential observation of magnetic field. Compared with other related work, this method proposed in this paper eliminates the dependence on gravity direction, avoiding the influence of heavy noise caused by additional linear acceleration in motion state, and reduces the influence of insufficient observation when using magnetic field observation alone. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated by real-world experimentation results.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/ielx7/7361/9733818/09492098.pdf,

The REE-rich terrane occurs in a 2.5-km-wide, northwest-trending belt of Mesoproterozoic (1.4 Ga) stocks and dikes, which intrude a larger Paleoproterozoic (1.7 Ga) metamorphic block that extends ∼10 km southward from Clark Mountain to the eastern Mescal Range. To characterize the REE terrane, gravity, magnetic, magnetotelluric, and whole-rock physical property data were analyzed. Geophysical data reveal that the Mountain Pass carbonatite body is associated with an ∼5 mGal local gravity high that is superimposed on a gravity terrace (∼4 km wide) caused by granitic Paleoproterozoic host rocks. Physical rock property data indicate that the Mountain Pass REE suite is essentially nonmagnetic at the surface with a magnetic susceptibility of 2.0 × 10−3 SI (n = 57), and lower-than-expected magnetizations may be the result of alteration. However, aeromagnetic data indicate that the intrusive suite occurs along the eastern edge of a distinct northwest-trending aeromagnetic high along the eastern Mescal Range. The source of this magnetic anomaly is ∼1.5–2 km below the surface and coincides with an electrical conductivity zone that is several orders of magnitude more conductive than the surrounding rock. The source of the magnetic anomaly is likely a moderately magnetic pluton. Combined geophysical data and models suggest that the carbonatite and its associated REE-enriched ultrapotassic suite were preferentially emplaced along a northwest-trending zone of weakness, which has potential implications for regional mineral exploration.",https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geosphere/article-pdf/16/1/456/4920077/456.pdf,

However, each region has different ground topography based on the amount of gravity in this region. Nowadays, the recent global Earth's gravity model of 2008 is successfully used for different purposes in geosciences research. This research presents an overview of the preliminary evaluation results of the new Earth Gravitation Model (EGM08) in the middle of Iraq. For completeness, the evaluation tests were also performed for EGM96 by examining 31 stations distributed over four Iraqi provinces. The national orthometric heights were compared with the GPS /leveling data obtained from these stations. This study illustrated that the GPS /leveling based on EGM08 data was better than that based on EGM96 data in terms of reducing the root mean square error (RMSE) of the differences between the orthometric heights and GPS/leveling data. The standard deviation (SD) values for the national orthometric heights and GPS heights were about 4 and 26cm, respectively. The results also show that there is a small difference in hight ranged (0.0013 0.1333 m) in Karbala, (0.0023 – 0.0062 m), in Najaf and (0.0173 – 0.0703 m), in Babylon. Due to the flat area, better results were obtained in Karbala and Najaf than Babylon.

Calculations using known parameters of the earth and measured field data has resulted in new understanding of the earth’s electrical system and gyroscopic rotation. The material makeup of the inner earth is better understood based on derived permeability and permittivity constants. The planet has been modeled as simple coils and then as a parallel impedance circuit which has led to fundamental insight into planetary speed control and RLC combination for Schumann Resonance of 7.83 Hz. Torque and Voltage Constants and the inverse Speed Constant are calculated using three methods and all compare favorably with Newton’s Gravitational Constant. A helical resonator is referenced and Schumann’s Resonant ideal frequency is calculated and compared with others idealism. A new theory of gravity based on particle velocity selector at the poles is postulated. Two equations are presented as the needed links between Faraday’s electromagnetism and Newtonian physics. Acceleration and Deceleration of earth is explained as a centripetal governor. A new equation for planetary attraction and the attraction of atomic matter is theorized. Rotation of the earth’s electrical coil is explained in terms of the Richardson effect. Electric power transfer from the sun to the planets is proposed via Flux Transfer Events. The impact of this evolving science of electromagnetic modeling of planets will be magnified as the theory is proven, and found to be useful for future generations of engineers and scientists who seek to discover our world and other planets.",https://doi.org/10.4236/jhepgc.2017.34051,

Without access to basic water supplies, disease and ill-health, poverty, environmental degradation and even conflict may be the result – all of which lead, in turn, to greater water stress. Water-related conflict does not have to take on the attributes of war in order to be debilitating – it can fester between groups, ignite between neighbouring farmers or industrialists, and can cause loss of trust between people and their governments. When water conflict erupts between sovereign states, the victims may not perish on any clearly discernible battlefield, but the people and the watercourse itself will suffer the consequences of the absence of either co-operation or communication between those sharing a basin.” (Hartnady & Hay, 2004). This statement shows the whole importance of the science of management of water and related issues. In fact, scientists long ago sought to understand the process of water cycle. This understanding helped them monitor the changes in the quantity and the quality of water occurring through the fluxes of water from the atmosphere to the surface of the earth and underground, fluxes of solutes and sediments and the effects of gravity and radiation. Science based knowledge of these hydrological processes assisted in explaining and predicting water-related hazards, notably droughts, floods, tornadoes, cyclones, landslides, mudslides, etc. Yet, due to the high risk associated to environmental changes, traditional scientific postulates and models have become inadequate to controlling water disasters, particularly in the “Arid and semi-arid lands” (ASALs) (Brasington et al., 1998). Under the effect of population pressure on natural resources, water disasters tend to cause agricultural inefficiency resulting in food insecurity and poverty outreach in most ASALs (FAO, 1995; Shisanya, 1996; UNDP, 2007; World Bank, 2007). There is thus need for reviewing traditional premises, hypotheses and theorems of water disaster management to adapt them to environmental changes. Hydro-economic risk assessment offers a novel framework towards sustainable management of agricultural water disaster in ASALs. This study evaluates hydro-geomorphologic risks, and their social and economic impacts associated with farming water use in dry and marginal lands of Kenya. The risk assessment conducted in Muooni Dam Catchment of Kenya utilized an “hydroeconomic” procedure to assess the risks related to farming water and land use, and served",https://doi.org/10.5772/16320,

These planets significantly widen the range of planetary properties over which habitable conditions could exist. We conduct internal structure modelling of Hycean worlds to investigate the range of interior compositions, ocean depths and atmospheric mass fractions possible. Our investigation explicitly considers habitable oceans, where the surface conditions are limited to those that can support potential life. The ocean depths depend on the surface gravity and temperature, confirming previous studies, and span 10s to ∼1000 km for Hycean conditions, reaching ocean base pressures up to ∼6 × 104 bar before transitioning to high-pressure ice. We explore in detail test cases of five Hycean candidates, placing constraints on their possible ocean depths and interior compositions based on their bulk properties. We report limits on their atmospheric mass fractions admissible for Hycean conditions, as well as those allowed for other possible interior compositions. For the Hycean conditions considered, across these candidates we find the admissible mass fractions of the H/He envelopes to be ≲10−3. At the other extreme, the maximum H/He mass fractions allowed for these planets can be up to ∼4–8 per cent, representing purely rocky interiors with no H2O layer. These results highlight the diverse conditions possible among these planets and demonstrate their potential to host habitable conditions under vastly different circumstances to the Earth. Upcoming JWST observations of candidate Hycean worlds will allow for improved constraints on the nature of their atmospheres and interiors.",https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-pdf/529/1/409/56814595/stae413.pdf,

In this article, we will describe a revolution that is happening now: the second quantum revolution which unifies matter/space with information. In other words, the new world view suggests that elementary particles (the bosonic force particles and fermionic matter particles) all originated from quantum information (qubits): they are collective excitations of an entangled qubit ocean that corresponds to our space. The beautiful geometric Yang–Mills gauge theory and the strange Fermi statistics of matter particles now have a common algebraic quantum informational origin.",https://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/1721.1/124370/2/1709.03824.pdf,

Reuse of waste tiles in construction sector helps to reduce the over quarrying of aggregate and also helps in proper management of waste in urban area. This experimental study deals with the investigation of possibility of using waste ceramic tile in concrete. In this study the physical characteristics of ceramic tile aggregate are measured. They are used in concrete as the substitute for coarse aggregates with 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30 and 35 percentage of substitution. All other materials (cement, sand, coarse aggregate) of same properties are used for each samples. This experimental study found that the waste ceramic tile aggregate has permissible flakiness index, elongation index, fineness modulus, impact value. Specific gravity and water absorption value of tile aggregate are also obtained. Compressive and split tensile strength observed are good in most of the composition. This study finds that the use of waste ceramics tile could be the better solution for ceramics waste management. Also for increase in concrete quality 15 to 25 percentage addition of ceramic tile aggregate could have done. Keywords—Aggregate, Ceramic Tile, Concrete, Recycling, Solid Waste INTRODUCTION A. Background Concrete is one of the key construction materials worldwide. Large amount of concrete is being used in construction industry. Use of concrete implies use of cement, fines and coarse aggregate as well. Aggregate is key ingredient in terms of strength and volume in concrete. Aggregate is non-renewable natural resource. The resources in our country are being overexploited and the natural stock is decreasing at an alarming rate. Use of waste tile aggregate as replacement for coarse aggregate helps to reduce overexploitation as well as manage the waste. The amount of tile waste on earth is enough for use as an aggregate in concrete. Tile is produced from natural materials sintered at high temperatures. There are no harmful chemicals in tile. Waste tiles cause only the apparition of pollution. However, some parts of tiles are used in cotto as flooring and also flooring in tennis courts, walkways, cycling paths and gardens as a ground material. Therefore, waste tiles are stored in factory fields because of their economic value. These waste materials can be recycled to save money. Crushed tile aggregate is a material especially proposed for the buildings constructed in hot climates. The unit weight of concrete is decreased with use of the CTA compared to the control concrete [1]. Rapid industrial development causes serious problems all over the world such as depletion of natural aggregates and creates enormous amount of waste material from construction and demolition activities. One of the ways to reduce this problem is to utilize the waste. A large quantity of wastages produced annually in all countries, in particular construction and demolition waste contribute the highest percentage of wastes worldwide about 75%. Furthermore, ceramic materials contribute the highest percentage of wastes within the construction and demolition wastes about 54% [2]. Ceramic waste can be transformed into useful coarse aggregate. The properties of ceramic waste coarse aggregate are well within the range of the values of concrete making aggregates. The properties of ceramic waste coarse aggregate concrete are not significantly different from those of conventional concrete. The use of ceramic waste coarse aggregate concrete has increased because it has various advantages over other cementations materials [3]. It has been estimated that about 30% of the daily production in the ceramic industry goes to waste. This waste is not recycled in any form at present. However, the ceramic waste is durable, hard and highly resistant to biological, chemical and physical degradation forces. As the ceramic waste is piling up every day, there is pressure on the ceramic industries to find a solution for its disposal. Meanwhile, conventional crushed stone aggregate reserves are depleting fast, particularly in some desert regions of the world. Use of inorganic industrial residual products in making concrete will lead to sustainable concrete design and greener environment (Senthamarai and Manoharan, 2005). Recycling and reusing aggregate from demolished building is not a new concept several countries have been International Journal of Engineering Research & Technology (IJERT) ISSN: 2278-0181 http://www.ijert.org IJERTV9IS070674 (This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.)

However, yield and productivity of the crop have been far below the world average. The present study was, therefore, undertaken to improve the productivity and quality of potato through proper planting depth and time of earthing up under supplemental irrigation using Jalane variety. The result revealed that days to flowering, days to physiological maturity, plant height, leaf number per plant, number of main stem per plant, unmarketable tuber number, marketable tuber yield, unmarketable tuber yield, total tuber yield, dry matter content, size category and specific gravity were significantly different due to the main effects of planting depth and time of earthing up. Interaction effect of planting depth and time of earthing up significantly affected the yield and quality of potato plants. The highest marketable and total tuber yield was recorded from the earthing up at 25 days after emergence using 12 cm depth of planting. The result may give firsthand information for potato producers to maximize their productivity. The production of potato is improved through the combination of 12 cm planting depth and earthing up at 25 days after emergence.",https://doi.org/10.1080/23311932.2022.2131995,

For Klein, human made climate change does not call for adaptation or mitigation; it is a civilizational wake-up call. Confronting the apocalypse is not about “changing light bulbs” - it is about change, about transforming the “social system” causing human extinction, about revolting against capitalism (2014b). Dystopian scenarios do not leave much scope for this. In the face of climatic catastrophe, sci-fi authors tend to affirm the inevitable, leaving room only for either apathy or individualist survivalism, stockpiling food and fuel. Climatic change may be a civilizational wake-up call, one of several possible dystopian futures. How do we as a species confront the threat of global population growth and food production collapsing? Of asteroids and comets smashing into Earth? Of the aging sun inevitably eating its planets? Saving humanity is certainly not about changing light bulbs or other technical fixes. “Dad says that there is nothing to do” the frightened child resigns, as apocalypse is fast approaching in the shape of the planet Melancholia, set on its predestined course towards Earth. In von Trier’s film a dramatic galactic dance of death begins when a new solar system emerges in the dark night sky. The Antares system, with its orbiting planet Melancholia, is on its course towards Earth, destined to pass right in front of Justine and her family shortly after her wedding, presenting them with the ”most beautiful sight ever”. As Melancholia approaches, Justine falls into a melancholic mood, anticipating things to come. As the deadly dance of the celestial bodies unfold, the red star Antares is eclipsed by the planet revolving around it. Melancholia is drawn into orbit by the gravity of Earth and after days of hope and despair it becomes evident that the blue planet Melancholia will collide with the equally blue planet Earth. In the opening and closing sequences of the film Gaia and Melancholia melt together, leaving no room for doubt that life as we know it will be destroyed. Still Justine comforts the child. “If your daddy says this, then he has forgotten something. He has forgotten about the magic cave.” And without hesitation she walks off to the woods together with the child, to build a magic cave that might save them from their destined demise. With this contribution we attempt to build “a magic cave”, a blend of utopian-speculative-exploration strategies that deploy an active approach to collaborative future-making. Recognizing that our future may be lost, but that many prospects (Latour 2010: 485) are there to be explored, we combine Latour’s compositionist perspective and Dunne & Raby’s speculative way of imagining preferable futures (2013) with Ernst Bloch’s philosophy of concrete utopias as immanent and open elements of the real existing world (1959). In doing this we ground our argument on speculation as well as materialised design projects realised by the authors or in close collaboration with them.",https://dl.designresearchsociety.org/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1390&context=nordes,

One of the greatest difficulties is that humans cannot live in an extra-Earth environment without proper equipment. In addition, the consequences of chronic gravity alterations in human body are not known. Here, we used planarians as a model system to test how gravity fluctuations could affect complex organisms. Planarians are an ideal system, since they can regenerate any missing part and they are continuously renewing their tissues. We performed a transcriptomic analysis of animals submitted to simulated microgravity (Random Positioning Machine, RPM) (s-µg) and hypergravity (8 g), and we observed that the transcriptional levels of several genes are affected. Surprisingly, we found the major differences in the s-µg group. The results obtained in the transcriptomic analysis were validated, demonstrating that our transcriptomic data is reliable. We also found that, in a sensitive environment, as under Hippo signaling silencing, gravity fluctuations potentiate the increase in cell proliferation. Our data revealed that changes in gravity severely affect genetic transcription and that these alterations potentiate molecular disorders that could promote the development of multiple diseases such as cancer.",https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/20/3/720/pdf?version=1549614766,

A better understanding of these phenomena involving large areas of hundreds of square kilometers came from the last gravity satellite mission that allowed detecting mass transfer through the Earth interior. In this work, we performed direct modeling of satellite GOCE (Gravity Field and Steady-State Ocean Circulation Explorer) derived gravity gradients up to degree/order N = 200 of the harmonic expansion and then corrected this by the effect of topography. Cutting off the model up to this degree/order allows inferring mass heterogeneities located at an approximate depth of 31 km, just along the plate interface where most (but not all) significant slip occurs. Then, we compared the vertical gravity gradient to well-constrained coseismic slip models for three of the last major earthquakes along the Sunda interface. We analyzed seismic rupture behavior for recent and for historical earthquakes along this subduction margin and the relationship of the degree of interseismic coupling using the gravity signal. From this, we found that strong slip patches occurred along minima gravity gradient lobes and that the maximum vertical displacements were related quantitatively to the gravity-derived signal. The degree of interseismic coupling also presents a good correspondence to the vertical gravity gradient, showing an inverse relationship, with low degrees of coupling over regions of relatively higher density. This along-strike segmentation of the gravity signal agrees with the along-strike seismic segmentation observed from recent and historical earthquakes. The thermally controlled down-dip ending of the locked fault zone along central Sumatra also presented an inverse relationship with the density structure along the forearc inferred using our modeling. From this work, we inferred different mass heterogeneities related to persistent tectonic features along the megathrust and along the marine forearc, which may control strain accumulation and release along the megathrust. Combining these data with geodetical and seismological data could possibly delimit and monitor areas with a higher potential seismic hazard around the world.",https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/feart.2020.581396/pdf,

The impact of human activities on the climate system is well established, and unsustainable emissions of greenhouse gasses will continue to be high for the coming decades (IPCC, 2014). Even under optimistic scenarios, such as limiting warming by the end of the century to 1.5 or 2.0°C above pre-industrial conditions, climate change impacts will be considerable (Kraaijenbrink et al., 2017; IPCC, 2018). The warming up of the Earth and shifting patterns of precipitation and drought have significant impact on natural systems, our agricultural activities, natural resources, ecology, and the living environment. Some regions are more prone to global change than others and we must assess that vulnerability to be prepared and to mitigate the negative effects. Next to the threat of climate change there are health threats like the COVID-19 event that greatly reduced economic activities and mobility worldwide (Silver, 2020). Similar ecological events are likely to occur over the next decade due to the high world population numbers, the great mobility of people, the visits into remote unexplored areas and climate change (Boldog et al., 2020; Ivanov, 2020). Monitoring our environment using a wide range of remote sensing systems, building up knowledge about the functioning of “System Earth” and developing models and methods for safeguarding our living environment becomes increasingly important. Much of what we know about “System Earth” and about changes at the Earth surface is derived from information acquired by remote sensing systems. A wide suite of spaceborne sensors in the optical, thermal, and microwave spectrum, systems measuring gravity fields and atmospheric composition provide that essential information (Belward and Skøien, 2015; Denis et al., 2017). Manned airborne observations are rare and often experimental and do not contribute to long-term standardized monitoring of the Earth surface (Tan, 2016). While low spatial resolution Earth observation using sensors, such as Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer and Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, are suitable for global studies of changes at the Earth surface, historic archives of moderate resolution images such as National Aeronautics and Space Administration-Landsat (since 1984) and European Space AgencySentinel (since 2015) with optical andmicrowave images are well suited for regional studies, and archives of high-resolution images of, e.g., OrbView, Ikonos, Pleiades, PlanetLabs are available for local studies (Zhu & Scott Mackay, 2001; Gorelick et al., 2017; Zhu, 2017). Some of these datasets are freely available, others are commercial datasets. Examples of successful studies ofmapping Earth surface change are in the field of deforestation (Kennedy et al., 2012; Kennedy et al., 2018), landslides (Deijns et al., 2020), land cover (Kaptué Tchuenté et al., 2011; Wulder et al., 2018; Zurqani et al., 2018), glaciers and ice sheets (Rignot and Thomas, 2002; Anderson, 2011; Mouginot et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2020). Over recent decades, Unpiloted Airborne Systems (UASs) have developed in a very fast and extraordinary way and filled the scale gap between spaceborne observations and detailed field, often point observations. The UASs are adding an sizable amount of local and regional spatio-temporal knowledge about surface processes and land cover dynamics (González-Jorge et al., 2017; Liew et al., Edited and reviewed by: Jose Antonio Sobrino, University of Valencia, Spain",https://doi.org/10.3389/frsen.2020.601737,

How did Life begin and evolve?; Is there Life elsewhere in the Universe?; and, What is the future of Life on Earth?

Here on Earth, microbial Life has evolved to exist in a wide range of habitats from aquatic systems to deserts, the human body, and the International Space Station (ISS). Landers, rovers, and orbiter missions support the search for signatures of Life beyond Earth, by generating data on surface and subsurface conditions of other worlds. These have provided evidence for water activity, supporting the potential for extinct or extant Life. To investigate the putative ecologies of these systems, we study extreme environments on Earth. Several locations on our planet provide analog settings to those we have detected or expect to find on neighboring and distant worlds. Whereas, the field of space biology uses the ISS and low gravity analogs to gain insight on how transplanted Earth-evolved organisms will respond to extraterrestrial environments.

Developing a space suit that supports safe, efficient, and effective exploration despite the extremes of temperature, pressure, radiation, and environmental hazards like dust and topography remains a critical challenge. Space suits impose restrictions on movement that increase metabolic rate and limit the intensity and duration of extravehicular activity. In this study, a lower body exoskeleton was used to test a simple model that predicts the energy cost of locomotion across gait and gravity. Energetic cost and other variables were measured during treadmill locomotion, with and without a lower body exoskeleton, in simulated reduced gravity and in Earth gravity. Six subjects walked and ran at constant Froude numbers, non-dimensional parameters used to characterize gait. The springlike energy recovery of the exoskeleton legs was estimated using energetics data in combination with the model. Model predictions agreed with the observed results (no statistical difference). High spring-like energy recovery of the exoskeleton legs lowered measures of the energetic cost of locomotion. For planetary extravehicular activity, our work reveals potential approaches to optimizing space suits for efficient locomotion, for example, tuning the stiffness and spring-like energy recovery of space suit legs.",https://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/1721.1/114879/1/Exoskeleton%20Energetics_2017.pdf,

Many solutions for Earth’s gravity field variations have been developed by institutes around the world based on GRACE/GRACE-FO data; however, it remains inconclusive which of them is the most reliable for the determination of PM excitation. In this study, we present a combined series of GRACE/GRACE-FO-based gravimetric excitation of PM computed using the three-cornered-hat (TCH) method, wherein the internal noise level in a combined solution is reduced to a minimum. We compare the combined series with results obtained from the combined GRACE/GRACE-FO solution provided by COST-G (International Combination Service for Time-variable Gravity Fields) and from the single solution elaborated by the Center for Space Research (CSR). All the gravimetric excitation series are evaluated by comparison with the sum of hydrological and cryospheric signals in geodetically observed PM excitation (called GAO). The results show that by minimizing the internal noise level in the combined excitation series using the TCH method, we can receive higher consistency with GAO than in the case of COST-G and CSR solutions, especially for the non-seasonal oscillations. For this spectral band, we obtained correlations between GAO and the best-combined series as high as 0.65 and 0.72 for the χ1 and χ2 equatorial components of PM excitation, respectively. The corresponding values for seasonal oscillation were 0.91 for χ1 and 0.89 for χ2. The combined series developed in this study explain up to 68% and 60% of overall GAO variability for χ1 and χ2, respectively.",https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/14/24/6292/pdf?version=1670989727,

Although speculative ideas of an expanding Earth can be found before World War II, it was only in the 1950s and 1960s that the theory attracted serious attention among a minority of earth scientists. While some of the proponents of the expanding Earth adopted an empiricist attitude by disregarding the physical cause of the assumed expansion, others argued that the cause, either fully or in part, was of cosmological origin. They referred to the possibility that the gravitational constant was slowly decreasing in time, as first suggested by P. Dirac in 1937. As a result of a stronger gravitation in the past, the ancient Earth would have been smaller than today. The gravitational argument for an expanding Earth was proposed by P. Jordan and L. Egyed in the 1950s and during the next 2 decades it was discussed by several physicists, astronomers and earth scientists. Among those who for a period felt attracted by ""gravitational expansionism"" were A. Holmes, J. Tuzo Wilson and F. Hoyle. The paper examines the idea of a varying gravitational constant and its impact on geophysics in the period from about 1955 to the mid-1970s.",https://doi.org/10.5194/hgss-6-45-2015,

Venus had long enchanted humans—all the more so after astronomers realized it was shrouded in a mysterious cloak of clouds permanently hiding the surface from view. It was also the closest planet to Earth, with nearly the same size and surface gravity. These attributes brought myriad speculations about the nature of Venus, its climate, and the possibility of life existing there in some form. Mars also harbored interest as a place where life had or might still exist. Seasonal changes on Mars were interpreted as due to the possible spread and retreat of ice caps and lichen-like vegetation. A core element of this belief rested with the climatology of these two planets, as observed by astronomers, but these ideas were significantly altered, if not dashed during the space age. Missions to Venus and Mars revealed strikingly different worlds. The high temperatures and pressures found on Venus supported a “runaway greenhouse theory,” and Mars harbored an apparently lifeless landscape similar to the surface of the Moon. While hopes for Venus as an abode of life ended, the search for evidence of past life on Mars, possibly microbial, remains a central theme in space exploration. This survey explores the evolution of thinking about the climates of Venus and Mars as life-support systems, in comparison to Earth.",https://www.mdpi.com/2075-1729/2/3/255/pdf?version=1348050101,

For this important new experimental discovery, the author puts forward a new understanding of “positive and negative charges” and finds a new theory to explain all electrostatic effects. Based on the subversive new understanding of “matter”, “entity” and “heat energy”, a new understanding of “particle charge dynamic atomic model” is initiated. It is clarified that the relationship between “entity” and “heat energy” is the root of the existence of gravitation and repulsion between matter, The law of equilibrium distance between gravity and repulsion is put forward. This paper reveals the causes of the formation of the earth’s gravity and many phenomena of attraction and repulsion force in the universe and so on. In the fields of gravitational field, magnetic field, electric field and so on, a series of important scientific problems have been revealed! The establishment of the new theoretical system provides a new vision for solving “all physical problems”! The new theoretical system consists of six parts: the first part introduces the reasons for the establishment of the “new theoretical system”, the second part proposes a new basic epistemology of the material world, the third part is a new epistemology of the gravitational repulsion field, the fourth part is a new epistemology of the magnetic field, and the fifth part is a new epistemology of the electric field, and the sixth part expounds the scientific significance of the new theoretical system. Starting from a new perspective of the basic composition of “entity” and “heat energy” in the material world, this paper makes a new understanding of matter, entity, heat energy, atom, element, gravity, repulsion, magnetic field and electric field, Established 21st century physics new theoretical system, Material world: “entity” and “heat energy” constitute “unified field theory”. Scientific research needs a new vision to expand the subjective human thought’s understanding of the objective nature.

We explore the resulting divergent behavior of hydrothermal plumes in fresh versus salty icy ocean worlds, with particular emphasis on Europa and Enceladus. Large, salty, putative Europa‐like oceans, develop buoyant plumes which rise upwards in the water column when energized by localized hydrothermal vents. Instead, small, fresher, putative Enceladus‐like oceans, can develop bottom‐hugging gravity currents when heated near the freezing point, due to the anomalous contraction of fluid parcels on warming. Such a bottom‐filling regime would most likely be a transient stage in the evolution of an icy moon over geological time. The contrasting dynamics are highlighted and rationalized in terms of key non‐dimensional numbers with a focus on the ability of ocean to carry bio‐markers from the hydrothermal activity at the bottom to the ice shell at the top. Finally, the implications of our study for prioritizing future missions to icy moons are discussed. An advantage of a mission to a large icy moon (e.g., Europa), rather than a smaller target (e.g., Enceladus), is that a larger moon's ocean would likely support buoyant convection, which could bring signatures of seafloor venting to the outer ice‐shell regardless of that ocean's salinity. For smaller icy moons, the nature of convection would hinge on its assumed salinity.",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1029/2023JE007740,

Since the first Amaldi conference was held in Frascati in 1994, eleven years have passed and the scale of the conference has grown with the increasing activity in the field of gravitational waves. As the centenary celebration of Einstein's `miracle year', 2005 was called `World Year of Physics'. Among his breakthroughs published in 1905, the special theory of relativity is recognized as the most significant revolution in physics, completely changing our views concerning time and space. Ten years later, Einstein proposed the general theory of relativity, by which he predicted the existence of gravitational waves (GWs). At that time, it was only a dream to observe a GW because its effect was so small. Efforts to detect GWs, pioneered by Weber, have continued for almost 40 years, yet their detection remained a dream. However, the presentations at this conference have convinced us that it is no longer a dream. The GW detector projects have made extraordinary advances; in particular, the significant sensitivity improvement of LIGO and the completion of the VIRGO detector mark the beginning of the new era of GW physics. Firm developments in theories and source estimations were also reported. In particular, the data analysis session was very active and various discussions were held. Elaborate experimental techniques were presented, some of them already achieving the requirements for the next generation of detectors, such as Advanced LIGO and LCGT. In addition to the earth-based detectors, many presentations concerning space detectors were contributed; they indicated that space would become the new stage for GW physics and astronomy. This issue brings together the papers which were presented at this exciting conference. The proceedings comprise two volumes; the largest part is published as a volume of Journal of Physics: Conference Series and the other is a special issue of Classical and Quantum Gravity (CQG), presenting the highlights of the conference. This is the first time this format has been used and selecting the highlights for CQG was a difficult task as the quality of the papers submitted was so high. The issue has been published thanks to the excellent work of the reviewers who gave precise and appropriate comments to the Editors. We strongly believe this issue to be a milestone in the inception of GW astronomy. The conference organizers would like to acknowledge the financial support of IUPAP, Okinawa prefecture, Inoue Foundation for Science, The Foundation for Promotion of Astronomy and a Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research on Priority Areas (415) of the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology. The conference scientific programme was organized with the help of the session conveners. Their collaboration was indispensable for the success of the conference. We also appreciate the members of the international advisory committee and the local organizing committee; in particular, we thank Dr Akiteru Takamori for designing the fascinating poster of the conference and the image for the CD of this issue. The miscellaneous duties that were necessary for the conference were carried out with the help of ICS Convention Design Inc. with special thanks due to Ms Makiko Uwato and Mr Hiroyuki Suzuki. The proceedings are published by Institute of Physics Publishing; we would like to express our deep appreciation to Ms Judith Adams for her efficient management of the proceedings. Finally, we thank all of the excellent participants who made the conference so successful.",https://doi.org/10.1088/1742-6596/32/1/e01,

Today the International Center for Global Earth Models (ICGEM) provides the largest collection in the world produced through gravitational data from the gravitational satellite’s missions CHAMP, GRACE, and GOCE … Etc. To allow easy access through the internet with its more intelligent technologies, it is one of the International Gravity Organization’s services. While the Global Positioning System (GPS) has become one of the most preferred technologies in engineering surveying, a major dilemma in GPS survey lies in oval-based elevations. At the same time, orthometric heights are commonly used in the engineering field. Therefore, it is necessary to convert the measured heights by satellites assigned to the elliptical surface into orthometric heights and supported to the geoid surface (mean sea level) through an accurate geodetic model. The differences between orthometric measurement heights from DGPS/leveling data (obtained from 57 points in the study area) are increasingly used by professionals geographical information systems(GIS). However, the local determination of Geoid is necessary for better accuracy of the orthometric height from DGPS. This paper aims to introduce a modern technique for determining elevation, avoiding cumbersome and time-consuming spirit leveling operations. Fast vertical positioning can be obtained using DGPS with geoid models. The Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) is ± 0.19 m with high precision of DGPS derived with EGM08; thus, the more it describes the Earth’s gravitational field in more detail.",https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1742-6596/1879/3/032072/pdf,

Tremendous number of theoretical works on origin, nature, essentials, consequences, etc. of the gravitation and related phenomena were published so far. The most prominent ones are based on the Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity. The author of this communication based his approach to the gravitation on Isaac Newton's law of the universal gravitation and related quantities, i.e. gravitational forces of matter objects, distance and motion. Namely on the fact, that the gravitation force is - as well as the inertia, mass, space ""occupied"" and other properties are - principal features/attributes/properties of matter objects. Gravitation is an additive property of matter objects. Taking into account other positivistic quantities like mass of the Earth, standard acceleration of gravity, and the value of the atomic unit of mass, the author defined a gravitational force of atomic unit (or ""the Gravitational Force Quantum"") as a gravitational force which exerts one atomic unit of Earth's mass on 1 kilogram of a mass on Earths surface, and he calculated its value: GFO = 1.4958 × 10 -54 N. This quantity can be useful for further development of the ""quantum mechanical"" approach to the description and general notion about the world.",https://doi.org/10.17265/2159-5348/2015.04.007,

However, GNSS produces geodetic heights, which are not physically meaningful, limiting their functionality in many engineering applications. In Costa Rica, there is no regional model of the geoid, so geodetic heights (h) cannot be converted to physically meaningful orthometric heights (H). This paper describes the computation of a geoid model using the Stokes-Helmert approach developed by the University of New Brunswick. We combined available land, marine and satellite gravity data to accurately represent Earth's high frequency gravity field over Costa Rica. We chose the GOCO05s satellite-only global geopotential model as a reference field for our computation. With this combination of input data, we computed the 2020 Regional Stokes-Helmert Costa Rican Geoid (GCR-RSH-2020). To validate this model, we compared it with 4 global combined geopotential models (GCGM): EGM2008, Eigen6C-4, GECO and SGG-UM-1 finding an average difference of 5 cm. GECO and SGG-UM-1 are more similar to the GCR-RSH-2020 based on the statistics of the difference between models and the shape of the histogram of differences. The computed geoid also showed a shift of 7 cm when compared to the old Costa Rican height system but presented a slightly better fit with that system than the other models when looking at the residuals. In conclusion, GCR-RSH-2020 presents a consistent behaviour with the global models and the Costa Rican height systems. Also, the lowest variance suggests a more accurate determination when the bias is removed.",https://journal.geo.sav.sk/cgg/article/download/237/221,

The world population is increasing every day and there is constant need of more infrastructures such as roads, runways, dams, buildings, jetties, railways etc. All these structures are built on soils which sometimes do not have adequate bearing capacity to resist the loads coming on them. In Nigeria, the common soils used for construction work which are laterite are sometimes found unsuitable in its natural state for intended use. Thus, there is the need for soil improvement of which compaction is among the commonest and the cheapest. Laterites are described as highly weathered and altered residual soils formed by insitu weathering and decomposition of parent rocks under tropical and subtropical climatic conditions (Aginam et al., 2014). The increasing use of this soil is linked to its availability, cheapness and amenability to compaction. Compaction of lateritic soils like other soils, increases the bearing capacity of the soils. It also decreases the amount of undesirable settlement of structures constructed over such soils and increases the stability of slopes of embankments (Ratnam & Prasad, 2019). The strength of foundations largely depend on compaction control which is based on finding the maximum dry unit weight (MDUW) corresponding to an optimum moisture content (OMC) at a given compaction energy. Laboratory compaction is usually done in Nigeria with British Standard Light (BSL) (equivalent of standard Proctor method), West African Standard (WAS), and British Standard Heavy (BSH) (equivalent of modified Proctor method). These methods are laborious, time-consuming and material-consuming (Jayan & Sankar, 2015). The shortcomings outlined above together with proof by some earlier authors Ring et al. (1962), Ramiah et al. (1970), Benson et al. (1998) and most recently Anjita et al. (2017) that soil type, its grain size distribution, index properties, and specific gravity influence the MDUW and OMC of soils led researchers to develop empirical relationships between MDUW/OMC and index properties of soils. Such index properties as liquid limit (LL), plastic limit (PL), plasticity index (PI), fines content (FC), sand content (SdC) etc. have previously been used. Abstract Laboratory compaction of soils is an important aspect in the selection of materials for earthwork construction. Owing to time constraints and concern for depleting resources, it becomes imperative that empirical relationships would be developed to predict compaction parameters, maximum dry unit weight (MDUW) and optimum moisture content (OMC) from easily measured index properties. The aim of this note is to develop empirical relationships between MDUW /OMC and logarithm of compaction energy (E)/fines content: sand content ratio (FC/SdC) for some lateritic soils. Index property tests were carried out on twenty (20) lateritic soils to classify them and obtain the FC/SdC. The soils were compacted at three compaction energies; British Standard Light (BSL), West African Standard (WAS) and British Standard Heavy (BSH). Two models were developed from relationships based on slopes and intercepts derived from MDUW/OMC versus log E plots; one model employs ‘FC/SdC’ and one compactive effort (BSL) while the other model employs only ‘FC/SdC’. The models were validated for robustness with soils used in the development of the models and six (6) other soils not used to develop the models. For the prediction of BSH, the model employing FC/SdC and one compactive effort showed typical errors of ±0.63 kN/m3 and ±0.76% for MDUW and OMC respectively. The model employing only FC/SdC showed typical errors of ±0.4 kN/m3 and ±0.83% for MDUW and OMC respectively. The typical errors are within allowed variations for projects and standards for MDUW and OMC, thus the models are quite robust.",https://doi.org/10.28927/sr.2021.054120,

The resulting outcome provides important lithostructural information to the well-exposed, mineralized middle-to-lower crust at Alces Lake, comprising deep-seated poly-phase folds, ductile shear zones, and brittle faults. Geophysical–geological models of the Alces Lake property were constructed at different scales. The area of interest is located within the Beaverlodge Domain, about 28 km north of the Athabasca Basin’s northern margin. It contains some of the highest-grade rare earth elements (REE) in the world with the REE hosted predominantly in monazites within quartzo-feldspathic granitic to biotite–garnet–monazite–zircon-rich restite-bearing/cumulate mush melt pegmatites of anatectic origin (abyssal). Geophysical magnetic, gravity, and radiometric data were used together with Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) images to facilitate the processing, modeling, and interpretation. Consequently, major structures were identified at different scales; however, the emphasis was given to studying those at the district/camp scale. The REE zones discovered to date occur within a large district-scale refolded synformal anticline. The eastern limb of this folded structure comprises a 30–40 km long, NW-trending shear zone/fault corridor with deep-seated structural crustal roots that may have served as the major pathway for ascending fluids/melts and facilitated the emplacement of mineralization. Thus, shear zones, faults, and folds in combination with lithological contacts/rheological contrasts appear to control residual/cumulate pegmatite emplacement and monazite deposition. Anomalies obtained from the airborne equivalent thorium survey data prove to be the most useful for REE pegmatite exploration. The results herein provide new interpretation and modeling perspectives leading to a better understanding of the distribution and lithostructural controls of REE on the property, and to new guidelines for future exploration programs at Alces Lake and elsewhere in northern Saskatchewan.",https://www.mdpi.com/2075-163X/14/1/25/pdf?version=1703506126,

Geopotential numbers are derived from Global Positioning System (GPS) satellite surveying and disturbing potential on selected benchmarks. A model for the disturbing potential can be obtained by an existing set of spherical harmonic coefficients such as the Earth Gravity Model 2008 (EGM08). The approach provides absolute evaluation of local normal geopotential numbers (aka spheropotential numbers) related to a so-called World Height System (WHS). To test the validity of the proposed methodology, a numerical experiment was carried out related to a test region in Southern Brazil. The accuracy of the derived geopotential numbers was tested versus local normal geopotential numbers based on 262 GPS/leveling points. The root mean square error (RMSE) value for metric offset of BHS derived from geopotential numbers and the disturbing potential modeling in the test area was estimated to be near 0.224 meters in the absolute view. Therefore, since these spheropotential numbers are referred to a local datum, these results of comparisons may be an indicator of the mean bias of local network due to the effect of local Sea Surface Topography (SSTop) and possible offset between the unknown reference for the BHS and the quasigeoid model in the region.",https://www.scielo.br/j/bcg/a/vrpDnyQWKDNLC6z7VHyh9TR/?lang=en&format=pdf,

For some, this Plan B entails preparing for long-duration space missions and the development of human settlement on Mars. To plan for long-duration space missions, the development of food production technologies that can withstand extreme conditions such as poor soil, lack of gravity, and radiation are increasingly prioritized. These technologies may include genetic engineering, digital agriculture, 3D bioprinting, synthetically grown meat and more. Government and corporate proponents of long-duration space missions—NASA and SpaceX, among others—are actively funding agricultural research in space. They argue that the technologies developed for space will have positive implications beyond Mars—directly benefitting Earth and its inhabitants. This paper demonstrates that news reporting on the technology has been overall uncritical. Media narratives surrounding issues of food growth in space have not been studied. This study analyzes how English news media coverage (n = 170) from 67 publications report the feasibility of long-duration space missions, human settlements, and high-tech agricultural technologies. We provide a cross-section of the types of agricultural technologies being covered, the key organizations and actors in the field, and a critical analysis of media narratives. Using mixed methods content and discourse analysis, this study finds that the news media publications overwhelmingly portray long-duration space missions as both inevitable and a positive good for humanity. Without critically assessing the societal implications of food technologies for long-duration space missions vis-à-vis their benefits on Earth, we risk glossing over systemic and structural inequalities in the food system.",https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fcomm.2022.1007567/pdf,

It crosses southeastern East European Craton (the southern slope of the Voronezh Massif, Donbas, the Priazov Megablock), the North Azov Trough, the Middle Azov High, the Indolo-Kuban Depression, the Crimea-Caucasus inversion zone, the Sorokin Trough, the Shatsky and Andrusov Ridges in the Eastern Black Sea Basin. In terms of the number of tectonic structures of different ages and origin, the profile has no analogues in world practice. Along the profile there has first been carried out an interdisciplinary geological and geophysical study of the entire lithospheric cross-section with the use of seismic data, magnetic, gravity and thermal fields, information on seismic tomography and spontaneous electric emission of the Earth. Fundamentally new information has been obtained for the structure of the lithosphere and a number of controversial problems have been convincingly solved. Tectonically, the lithosphere is a complex collage of structures arised in different geodynamic conditions from the Archean to the Neogene as a result of successive stages of its formation. The regional regularities in the structure of the lithosphere are the decrease in the thickness of the crust from north to south, from ancient structures to young ones with simultaneous elevation of the top of asthenosphere from 210 km under the Voronezh Massif to 90 km under the East Black Sea Basin. The standard continental crystalline crust has been mapped on the southern slope of the Voronezh Massif and in the Priazov Megablock. It has been reworked by the Paleozoic rifting in Donbas. The analysis of the heterogeneity of the crystalline crust and mantle has first been used to assess the position of the actual boundary of the East European Platform and the transition zone to the Scythian Plate, which corresponds to the deepest position of the asthenosphere top and the division between domains of different seismic velocities in the lithospheric mantle. The changes in the crystalline crust type under the Main Azov Thrust fixes the buried boundary of the East European Platform. The relationship has been established between large sedimentary structures and the areas of change in the composition of the crystalline crust along suture zones. The main faults of the sedimentary cover as the sutures of different ages have been traced in the cross-section of the crystalline crust and in the upper mantle. The subcrustal decomposition of the mantle and the crust—mantle mixture at the base of the crust of the maximum thickness between the South Crimean and Mesozoic sutures and in Donbas have resulted from the lithosphere reworking during its development. Different types of crystalline crust and gentle inclined intracrustal disturbances sometimes causing doubling different layers of the crystalline crust provide evidence of repeated subduction of the oceanic crust of the Paleo-, Mezo- and Neotethys. The low-velocity mantle layer between the South Crimean and Mesozoic sutures indicates a present-day manifestation of the total effect of post-Paleozoic subductions. A set of possible rocks has been determined for the crystalline crust within the southern slope of the Voronezh Massif, Donbas and the Azov Mega block. In the Crimea-Caucasus inversion zone at a depth of 30 km a complex of rocks has been documented to be inherent in the standard continental crust which is an alternative to the speculation about the local elevation of the upper mantle due to the serpentinization of mafic rocks.",https://journals.uran.ua/geofizicheskiy/article/download/147476/195628,

Accurate computation of RTM corrections plays a crucial role in computing an accurate local quasi-geoid, and it requires a set of fine-tuned parameters, including the combination of DEMs with different resolutions for suitably representing the real topography, the choice of integration radius for properly defining the extent of the computation zone, and the determination of reference topography to properly describe the RTM-reduced Earth’s surface. To our knowledge, this has not been systematically documented, despite its obvious importance. This study aims to systematically investigate the impact of these factors on RTM correction computation and, consequently, on local quasi-geoid modeling to provide practical guidelines for real-world applications. The tesseroid-based gravity forward modeling technique is employed to investigate the following issues existing in the practical use of the RTM method: ① Can the combination of a high-resolution DEM and a DEM with a lower resolution replace the single use of the high-resolution DEM for RTM correction computation while maintaining accuracy and improving efficiency? If it does, how do I properly choose the resolution of this coarse DEM as well as the integration radius r1 for the inner zone and r2 for the outer zone? ② How large would the differences between the RTM corrections computed by three types of reference topographies, which are obtained from the direct averaging (DA) approach, the moving averaging (MA) approach, and the spherical harmonic (SH) approach, be, and how large would their impact on quasi-geoid modeling be? To obtain objective findings, two research regions were selected for this investigation. One is the Colorado test area (USA) with rugged terrain, and the other is the Auvergne test area (France) with moderate terrain. The main numerical findings are: (1) the combination of the 3” resolution DEM (inner zone) and the 30″ resolution DEM (outer zone) is sufficient for accurate and efficient RTM correction computation; (2) if the resolution of the reference topography is 5′ or slightly lower, all three types of reference topographies are able to obtain local quasi-geoid models at a similar accuracy level, while the values of r1 and r2 are preferred to be at least 20 km and 111 km, respectively; (3) if the reference topography has a resolution of 30′ or lower, the MA or SH reference topography is recommended, especially for the latter one, and the values of r1 and r2 are suggested to be at least 20 km and 222 km, respectively. The above numerical findings can be taken as a reference for local quasi-geoid determination in areas with different topographic regimes than the two selected test areas.",https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/15/14/3594/pdf?version=1689687563,

Laboratory experiments can constrain these early steps. This includes static tensile strength measurements or collisions carried out under Earth’s gravity and on various microgravity platforms. Among the variety of extrasolar planets which eventually form are (Exo)-Mercury, terrestrial planets with high density. If they form in inner protoplanetary disks, high temperature experiments are mandatory but they are still rare. Beyond the initial process of hit-and-stick collisions, some additional selective processing might be needed to explain Mercury. In analogy to icy worlds, such planets might, e.g., form in environments which are enriched in iron. This requires methods to separate iron and silicate at early stages. Photophoresis might be one viable way. Mercury and Mercury-like planets might also form due to the ferromagnetic properties of iron and mechanisms like magnetic aggregation in disk magnetic fields might become important.

The longitudinal‐latitudinal component of the true gravity, gh = igλ+jgφ, is neglected completely in meteorology through using the standard gravity (−g0k, g0 = 9.81 m/s2) or the effective gravity [−g(φ)K]. Here, k (or K) is normal to the Earth spherical (or ellipsoidal) surface. Such simplification of g(λ, φ, z) has never been challenged. This study uses the classical atmospheric Ekman layer dynamics as an example to illustrate the importance of gh. The standard gravity (−g0k) is replaced by the true gravity g in the classical atmospheric Ekman layer equation with a constant eddy viscosity (K) and a height‐dependent‐only density ρ(z) represented by an e‐folding stratification. New formulas for the Ekman spiral and Ekman pumping are obtained. The second derivative of the gravity disturbance (T), ∂2T/∂z2 , causes the Ekman pumping in addition to the geostrophic vorticity ( ζg ). With ∂2T/∂z2 from the EIGEN‐6C4 static gravity model, and ζg calculated from July sea level pressure (p) data from the Comprehensive Ocean‐Atmosphere Data Set, the global mean strength of the Ekman pumping over the world oceans is 3.69 cm s−1 due to gh, which is much larger than 0.33 cm s−1 due to the geostrophic vorticity. It implies the urgency to use the true gravity g(λ, φ, z) into atmospheric GCM and weather forecast although the results are obtained from specific density field and gravity model.",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1029/2021JD035293,

Although many industries exhibit gender discrepancies and continue to be shaped by sexism (e.g., banking, farming, mining, trucking, engineering, etc.), no other industry features so predominantly in our future-oriented visions for humanity as does science, and particularly space science. For women working in the male-dominated global space industry, space is a female frontier with a celestial ceiling. The United Nations (UN) reports that, in 2016, only 20% of workers in the space industry were women, and these figures had not improved in three decades. Women cannot defy the gravity of their situation without institutional change and a dramatic shift in cultural attitudes around gender. Science and human rights are linked; participation in science can improve a woman’s education and independence, life opportunities, status in society, and basic human rights.

The Earth gravity models of the Gravity Field and Steady-State Ocean Circulation Explorer (GOCE) and lithospheric structure models can be applied to estimate the stress tensor inside the Ethiopian lithosphere. To do so, the boundary-value problem of elasticity is solved to derive a general solution for the displacement field in a thin elastic spherical shell representing the lithosphere. After that, general solutions for the elements of the strain tensor are derived from the displacement field, and finally the stress tensor from the strain tensor. The horizontal shear stresses due to mantle convection and the vertical stress due to the mantle plume are taken as the lower boundary value at the base of the lithosphere, and no stress at the upper boundary value of the lithospheric shell. The stress tensor and maximum stress directions are computed at the Moho boundary in three scenarios: considering horizontal shear stresses due to mantle convection, vertical stresses due to mantle plume, and their combination. The estimated maximum horizontal shear stresses’ locations are consistent with tectonics and seismic activities in the study area. In addition, the maximum shear stress directions are highly correlated with the World Stress Map 2016, especially when the effect of the mantle plume is solely considered, indicating the stress in the study area mainly comes from the plume.",https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/15/2/462/pdf?version=1673571207,

This problem carries significant importance for analyzing models of discrete spacetime in quantum gravity; inferring network geometry in network science; and manifold learning in data science. The key contribution of this paper is to introduce and validate a new estimator of discrete sectional curvature for random graphs with low metric-distortion. The latter are constructed via a specific graph sprinkling method on different manifolds with constant sectional curvature. We define a notion of metric distortion, which quantifies how well the graph metric approximates the metric of the underlying manifold. We show how graph sprinkling algorithms can be refined to produce hard annulus random geometric graphs with minimal metric distortion. We construct random geometric graphs for spheres, hyperbolic and euclidean planes; upon which we validate our curvature estimator. Numerical analysis reveals that the error of the estimated curvature diminishes as the mean metric distortion goes to zero, thus demonstrating convergence of the estimate. We also perform comparisons to other existing discrete curvature measures. Finally, we demonstrate two practical applications: (i) estimation of the earth's radius using geographical data; and (ii) sectional curvature distributions of self-similar fractals.",https://academic.oup.com/comnet/article-pdf/11/4/cnad022/50695886/cnad022.pdf,

The purpose of the work is to create methods and technical means for determining the strength characteristics of bottom soils in the surface layer, aimed at reducing the time of creation and effective use of machines by ensuring that their parameters correspond to real operating conditions. Usually, the properties of deep-sea soil in its natural bedding (in situ) are determined from the data of photo- and geoacoustic sounding or from cores raised from the seabed to the surface, and the working loads of machines, the resistance of the soil to destruction and other mechanical characteristics are estimated on the basis of the data obtained by geological methods. New methods and devices for point and continuous sampling of the bottom, adequately applied both on the surface and under water, provide sufficient reliability of the information obtained for practical use. The objectives of the study are to substantiate the theory of gravity sensing of underwater soils and their cutting, to determine the deformation and strength properties of the surface layer of the seabed, resistance to mechanical destruction and the characteristics of the interaction of machine mechanisms with silty soil. The novelty of the research is to establish the features of the interaction of the working bodies and the undercarriage of earth-moving machines with underwater viscoplastic soils, depending on the parameters of the working process, strength properties of the soil, characteristics of dynamic loading and geophotoprofiling of underwater routes. The practical value lies in the substantiation of the operational loads of deep-water earth-moving machines; an assessment of the characteristics of bottom soils in natural bedding, as well as a comprehensive study of bottom massifs, which make it possible to reduce the number of sampling stations, the total labor intensity of voyage operations, to establish an operational bottom background and optimal routes of mining systems.",https://doi.org/10.32347/uwt2021.11.1301,

The Pantanal, located in the Paraguay river basin, is one of the world’s largest and most important wetlands because of the environmental biodiversity that represents. The satellite gravity mission GRACE (Gravity Recovery And Climate Experiment) provided until 2017 time-variable Earth’s gravity field models that reflected the variations due to mass transport processes-like continental water storage changes-which allowed to study environments such as wetlands, at large spatial scales. The water storage variations for the period 2002-2016, by using monthly land water mass grids of Total Water Storage (TWS) derived from GRACE solutions, were evaluated in the Pantanal area. The capability of the GRACE mission for monitoring this particular environment is analyzed, and the comparison of the water mass changes with rainfall and hydrometric heights data at different stations distributed over the Pantanal region was carried out. Additionally, the correlation between the TWS and river gauge measurements, and the phase differences for these variables, were also evaluated. Results show two distinct zones: high correlations and low phase shifts at the north, and smaller correlation values and consequently significant phase differences towards the south. This situation is mainly related to the hydrogeological domains of the area.",https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/jogs-2019-0013/pdf,

By modeling the dynamic gravity and topography signatures and by making use of a Bayesian inference approach, we investigate the viscosity structure of the Venusian mantle by constraining radial viscosity variations. We performed inversions under a wide range of model assumptions that consistently predicted the existence of a thin low‐viscosity zone in the uppermost mantle. The zone is about 235 km thick and has a viscosity reduction of 5–15 times with respect to the underlying mantle. Drawing a parallel with the Earth, the reduced viscosity could be a result of partial melting as suggested for the origin of the asthenosphere. These results support the interpretation that Venus is a geologically active world predominantly governed by ongoing magmatic processes.",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1029/2023GL103847,

This study images electrical resistivity structure of the REE deposit and surrounding area to characterize resources under cover. An east‐west elongated grid (35 × 15 km) of 65 wideband magnetotelluric stations spanning from eastern Shadow Valley to eastern Ivanpah Valley were collected and modeled in three‐dimensions (3‐D). Gravity, aeromagnetic, and geologic data are used to inform interpretation of structures in the resistivity model, including the following observations. Shadow Valley is filled with conductive sediment that locally dips southward to a depth of 1 km. The Kingston Range‐Halloran Hills detachment fault dips westward at ∼15 degrees. The REE deposit is a moderate low resistivity zone dipping southwest to a possible depth of ∼1 km, and is bounded by the North and South faults and bisected by the Middle fault. Ivanpah Dry Lake is underlain by a north striking southward dipping sedimentary basin. Two possible zones of mineralization are observed in Ivanpah Valley, one along the western edge of Ivanpah Dry Lake and one on the western edge of valley along a new inferred fault. The brittle‐ductile transition is imaged at ∼10 km below mean sea level. No deep electrically conductive structures are imaged to be related to the REE deposit likely due to the complex geologic history of the Mojave terrane. Future studies should regional target Proterozoic rocks and search within for geophysical signatures similar to Mountain Pass.",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1029/2021GC010029,

To date 3775 exoplanets have been confirmed contained within 625 planetary systems. Of the 3775 planets, 55 are deemed suitable to support life of which 1 is subterran (0.1-0.5ME or 0.4-0.8RE; ME=Earth mass, and RE=Earth radius), 22 are terran (0.5-5ME or 0.8-1.5RE) and 32 are superterran (510ME or 1.5-2.5RE) [1,2]. Facilitated in part to date by the Gaia [3,4] and Kepler space telescopes [5,6], the launch of the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) on April 18th, 2018 [7,8] which will monitor more than 200,000 stars for temporary drops in brightness caused by planetary transits further increases what is surely a highly likely outcome; identification of a set of candidates for further exploration. In 2018, the principle driver for identification of an ’Earth 2.0’, a planet very close to Earth characteristics is scientific curiosity and to determine whether life exists in, or beyond our Solar system. However, there is now growing evidence that the activities of humans as of 12,000yrs ago and to the present day have increased extinction rates of many species and that we are experiencing the 6th extinction level event (ELE) or the Holocene extinction [9,10]. The consequences of this latest ELE may add urgency to considering other planets for where mankind can migrate and settle, in part as a potential staging post for further exploration and in part as a failsafe should Earth become inhospitable to supporting life as we know it today. For both near (solar system) and deep (beyond solar system) space travel, the ergonomic challenges facing manned spaceflight for both human physiological and psychological adaptation to microgravity are well understood and countermeasures for and mitigation of the effects of microgravity are being developed [11], which include generation of artificial or simulated gravity in space [12-14]. The longevity of human lifespan is an as yet unsurmountable obstacle for reaching even the nearest stars with propulsion technologies available today and strategies are being considered which may prolong functional lifespan [15]. An alternative route to exploring deep space is to deploy unmanned space probes which combine the evolving fields of artificial intelligence, design and deployment of nano spacecraft and the futuristic concept of sending humans as avatars on small lightweight spacecraft as an e-crew. Taken together, it is possible to construct two parallel lines of thinking and simple decision matrices which utilize manned or unmanned space craft and in the first review we will consider their application to both near and far distance space travel missions.

World experience shows that the most destructive effect of seismic action is dynamic liquefaction. The probability of occurrence and intensity of this process are determined by the geological and hydrogeological structure of the soil massif. Based on the results of special laboratory and field dynamic tests of soils, it is not always possible to completely exclude the possibility of developing this extremely negative process. In this paper, the main stages of the analysis of the dynamic stability of the soil of the foundations of buildings and structures in complex engineering-geological conditions are presented. A brief review of existing domestic and foreign measures for the protection of buildings and structures from the dynamic dilution of soils is given. Information is provided on the applicability and comparative effectiveness of the methods in question. 1 Determination of seismic effect parameters The value of the cyclic tangential stress at any point below the horizontal surface of the earth during an earthquake when passing from below the shear wave can be determined using the method proposed by Seed H.B. and Idriss I.M. [1-3]. Assuming that the columnar column with height h moves horizontally, the maximum shear stress τmax acting on the foundation of the ground column will be max max , d a r h g       (1) where: amax is the peak value of the horizontal acceleration on the surface of the ground; g acceleration of gravity; γ is the specific gravity of the soil; rd is the stress reduction coefficient, taking into account the deformability of the soil column, the value of which is less than one. * Corresponding author: e.s.sobolev@mail.ru © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences.

Human exploitation and utilization of the ocean are relatively concentrated in these areas because of the extremely fertile lands with abundant water and diverse vegetation. More than 600 million people live on or near estuaries and deltas, who occupy only 1% of the world’s land mass, and the productive intersection of river and ocean has allowed port cities to flourish (Syvitski and Saito, 2007; Higgins, 2016). Therefore, estuaries and deltas have both important ecological and environmental values and socio-economic significance (Giosan et al., 2014). However, most of the world’s estuaries and deltas are deteriorating at an accelerated rate (Syvitski et al., 2009; Bergillos et al., 2016). Under the combined effects of hydrodynamics, human activities and climate change, the sediments undergo a series of dynamic changes, such as consolidation, liquefaction, erosion, resuspension, and transportation, as well as the dynamic changes of sediment composition, structure, physical, chemical, and geotechnical engineering properties (Morton and Sallenger, 2003; Liu et al., 2017; Burchard et al., 2018; Xiong et al., 2018; Albatal et al., 2019; Yang et al., 2019; Čelić et al., 2019; Glover et al., 2021). These sediment dynamic changes would induce the morphological evolution of estuaries and deltas and a series of geological disasters, such as coastal erosion, submarine landslides, gravity flow, which seriously threaten the marine engineering activities (Liu et al.; Maloney et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020). Generally speaking, sediment dynamics in estuaries and deltas and its derivative disasters are important aspects of marine geology and engineering studies and is one of the foci of international interest. In this Research Topic, we have gathered contributions from scientists working in diverse disciplines, from the geotechnical and engineering characteristics of sediments, OPEN ACCESS",https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/feart.2022.1079804/pdf,

The datum that defines the MSL (also called the geoid) is a complex surface that requires dense and accurate gravity data to define its shape. Determining the geoid in Iraq is not an easy matter, mainly because of the lack of necessary data at the present time. In the present simple study, ellipsoidal heights were derived from GPS measurements )with respect to WGS84 reference ellipsoid) at specific locations inside the campus of Mosul University. Orthometric heights (MSL) data of the test locations were then obtained according to geoid undulation (geoid height) given by the global model of the geoid (The Earth Gravitational Model 1996: EGM96). From the result of the measurements, a geoid map was produced for the study area. This study is being considered as primary attempt, so later in the future the whole geoid separation of Iraq can be measure or part of Iraq, I hope so. Introduction Physical geodesy is defined as the study of the physical properties of the gravity field of the earth, the geopotential, with a view to their application in geodesy(ref.1). Almost every geodetic measurement depends in a fundamental way on the earth’s gravity field. Therefore, the study of the physical properties of the gravity field and their geodetic application (which are the subject of physical geodesy) forms an essential part of the geodesist’s requirements (7). In view of this, determining the equipotential gravitational surface will still be a problem unless orthometric and geodetic heights are carefully mapped. In general, the global or large-scale features of the geoid are expressed by a spherical harmonic expression of the gravitational potential. Its higher terms are well defined by the ground gravity data, and the lower terms by the satellites tracking data (ref.2). The Earth Gravitational Model 1996 (EGM96) is one of the latest global models. This model suggests a global geoid with errors less than one meter (ref.3). It is recommended to be used with the World Geodetic System1984 (WGS84) ellipsoid. However, the height determined by Global Positioning System: GPS measurements relates to the reference ellipsoid, while the height of (MSL) determined with respect to geoid. The geoid can be as the equipotential surface of the earth gravity field that most closely approximation the mean sea level surface (ref.4).

Their study provides a better understanding of the problems of natural sciences at all levels, from elementary particles, to Universe as a whole. Therefore, the solution of these problems is an urgent and important task, which to the works of many generations of scientists of the world was dedicated. However, they have not been fully resolved. In well-known works, including general relativity, determination of the wave and energy parameters of the gravitational field of the Universe and their numerical values are absent. Solutions found are limited to tensor equations of a general form, which allows their interpretation of over a wide range. Other disadvantages of famous models are: 1) the voluminous world of the Universe reduced to the planes on which space objects and other objects move, sagging planes due to their own mass; 2) signs of “top” and “bottom” of the system, which are not in the real Universe, just as they are not on Earth and not in the Solar system; 3) the formation of “voids” between the object and the curved space and others. Main goals of the work to identify these contradictions and find ways to resolve them are performed. The main difference and the scientific novelty of the work performed are the justification of the gravity model based on a rigorous determination of the wave and energy parameters of the gravitational field of the Universe and their numerical values. The initial parameters of this worked—is the frequency oscillation νG of the waves of the gravitational field (Nastasenko’s constant) found in 2011. Research Results: Knowing νG can find all wave parameters of the gravitational field and their numerical values. The proposed new spatial-wave model of the action of gravity is based on the wave parameters of the gravitational fields of material objects. In the framework of their unity with electromagnetic fields, it reduces their structures to similar ones and eliminates the drawbacks of the previous model—of replaced gravity on curvature of space.",https://doi.org/10.4236/jamp.2020.812202,

Because of the errors caused by the airborne gravimeter sensors, and because of rough flight conditions, such errors cannot be completely eliminated. The precision of the gravity disturbances generated by the airborne gravimetry is around 3–5 mgal. A major obstacle in using airborne gravimetry are the errors caused by the downward continuation. In order to improve the results the external high-accuracy gravity information e.g., from the surface data can be used for high frequency correction, while satellite information can be applying for low frequency correction. Surface data may be used to reduce the systematic errors, while regularization methods can reduce the random errors in downward continuation. Airborne gravity surveys are sometimes conducted in mountainous areas and the most extreme area of the world for this type of survey is the Tibetan Plateau. Since there are no high-accuracy surface gravity data available for this area, the above error minimization method involving the external gravity data cannot be used. We propose a semi-parametric downward continuation method in combination with regularization to suppress the systematic error effect and the random error effect in the Tibetan Plateau; i.e., without the use of the external high-accuracy gravity data. We use a Louisiana airborne gravity dataset from the USA National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to demonstrate that the new method works effectively. Furthermore, and for the Tibetan Plateau we show that the numerical experiment is also successfully conducted using the synthetic Earth Gravitational Model 2008 (EGM08)-derived gravity data contaminated with the synthetic errors. The estimated systematic errors generated by the method are close to the simulated values. In addition, we study the relationship between the downward continuation altitudes and the error effect. The analysis results show that the proposed semi-parametric method combined with regularization is efficient to address such modelling problems.",https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/17/6/1205/pdf?version=1495715332,

The games presented (merry-go-rounds and slides) were designed to work on the astronomical concepts related to the translation of the Earth around the Sun, the phases of the Moon and gravity, and on what is perceived by an observer about those phenomena. The description of each game, their physical and astronomical foundations, and a critical comment about their didactical importance are the key parts of the paper.

From these abstractions I create diaphanous veils of blue that convey a sense of movement; the movement suggests primal forces: wind, water air and fire. The figure in the foreground is one of the elements: gold, copper, silver, which develop into a variety of fantastic shapes. The ‘elements’ which are the foundation of life on earth, are born in the heart of a star and explode out into the universe upon its death and collapse. The force of gravity brings them spiraling together to create planets, solar systems and life. My paintings are meant to convey a sublime feeling for these forces and to draw my audience into a meditation on the wonder of creation. Natural forms communicate feelings and histories of the evolution of life. I am intuitively searching for forms that capture my imagination and launch a universe of meaning. Author/Artist Bio I was raised in Lancaster, California. My father was a test pilot and later became an engineer in the aerospace industry, working to land a man on the moon. As a young child we would walk to the end of our street, which dead-ended at the edge of the desert to watch the X-15 coming in for a landing after skirting the edge of the atmosphere. It was here that the first philosophical musings arose in my young mind. When I stood on the pavement of our street I was in ‘civilization’, but by simply stepping over the edge onto the desert sand I was back in ‘nature’ among the Road Runners, Jack Rabbits, Horny Toads and Kangaroo Rats that were my companions on my excursions into the wild. At the age of 6 we moved to Orange County and my love of the ocean grew out of a youth spent surfing from San Diego to Malibu. I began drawing at a young age and chronicled my friends and the neighborhood where I lived with a drawing pad and a pen always at my side. At the age of 21, after a brief stint trying out commercial illustration, I made a vow to spend the rest of my life pursing my art. I am a self-taught artist, learning with deep passion the history of art from countless hours reading and visiting museums throughout the world. I have curated two major exhibitions, “Them; Artists, Scientists and Designers Concerned with the Entomological World” SOMARTS, San Francisco, CA in 1999 and “The Age of Wonder; Artist’s Engaged with the Natural World” Turtle Bay Museum, Redding, CA in 2011. Both of these exhibitions gave me an opportunity to explore contemporary artists who share my passion for nature and art. My works have been exhibited in New York, Los Angeles and San Francisco and are in private, corporate and museum collections throughout the United States.",https://doi.org/10.5642/steam.20160202.16,

In India, most groundwater level observations are only available on a seasonal scale, i.e., January (late post-monsoon), May (pre-monsoon), August (monsoon), and November (early post-monsoon). The Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) data are available to estimate the monthly variation in groundwater storage (GWS) by subtracting precipitation runoff, canopy water, soil moisture, and solid water (snow and ice) from the GLDAS model. Considering GRACE-based GWS data, the data fusion is further used to estimate monthly spatial maps of groundwater levels using time-varying spatial regression. Seasonal groundwater monitoring data are used in the training stage to identify spatial relations between groundwater level and GWS changes. Estimation of unknown groundwater levels through data fusion is accomplished by utilizing spatial coefficients that remain consistent with the nearest observed months. Monthly groundwater level maps show that the lowest groundwater level is 50 to 55 m below the earth’s surface in the state of Rajasthan. The accuracy of the estimated groundwater level is validated against observations, yielding an average RMSE of 2.37 m. The use of the GWS information enables identification of monthly spatial patterns of groundwater levels. The results will be employed to identify hotspots of groundwater depletion in India, facilitating efforts to mitigate the adverse effects of excessive groundwater extraction.",https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/15/10/8295/pdf?version=1684491183,

It is impossible without the correct coordinate transformation at the transition from one system to another. The determination of the coordinates of points using the satellite radio navigation system NAVSTAR GPS is closely related to the world geodetic coordinate system WGS-84. At the same time, data on gravity observations within the Pulkovo 1942 coordinate system have been accumulated in large volumes. It is obvious the need for recalculation of coordinates given in different systems. Information is given on the coordinate systems, geodetic coordinates, units of measurement, display formats for latitude and longitude values. The reference coordinate system of Pulkovo 1942 and the modern world geodetic system WGS-84 are described in sufficient detail. Formulas are given for calculating the normal gravity in these systems. Historical background and classification of coordinate transformation methods are considered. Significant role is given to the high-precision method of Molodensky and the modified Helmert method of coordinate transformation. The standard method of Molodensky is described at the level it is described in official open reports of US government agencies. Programs are considered that automate the solution of the problem of recalculating the coordinates of objects, as well as the issues of transformation of coordinate systems in geographical information systems.

Since the first Amaldi conference was held in Frascati in 1994, eleven years have passed and the scale of the conference has grown with the increasing activity in the field of gravitational waves. As the centenary celebration of Einstein's `miracle year', 2005 was called `World Year of Physics'. Among his breakthroughs published in 1905, the special theory of relativity is recognized as the most significant revolution in physics, completely changing our views concerning time and space. Ten years later, Einstein proposed the general theory of relativity, by which he predicted the existence of gravitational waves (GWs). At that time, it was only a dream to observe a GW because its effect was so small. Efforts to detect GWs, pioneered by Weber, have continued for almost 40 years, yet their detection remained a dream. However, the presentations at this conference have convinced us that it is no longer a dream. The GW detector projects have made extraordinary advances; in particular, the significant sensitivity improvement of LIGO and the completion of the VIRGO detector mark the beginning of the new era of GW physics. Firm developments in theories and source estimations were also reported. In particular, the data analysis session was very active and various discussions were held. Elaborate experimental techniques were presented, some of them already achieving the requirements for the next generation of detectors, such as Advanced LIGO and LCGT. In addition to the earth-based detectors, many presentations concerning space detectors were contributed; they indicated that space would become the new stage for GW physics and astronomy. This issue brings together the papers which were presented at this exciting conference. The proceedings comprise two volumes; the largest part is published as a volume of Journal of Physics: Conference Series and the other is a special issue of Classical and Quantum Gravity (CQG), presenting the highlights of the conference. This is the first time this format has been used and selecting the highlights for CQG was a difficult task as the quality of the papers submitted was so high. The issue has been published thanks to the excellent work of the reviewers who gave precise and appropriate comments to the Editors. We strongly believe this issue to be a milestone in the inception of GW astronomy. The conference organizers would like to acknowledge the financial support of IUPAP, Okinawa prefecture, Inoue Foundation for Science, The Foundation for Promotion of Astronomy and a Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research on Priority Areas (415) of the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology. The conference scientific programme was organized with the help of the session conveners. Their collaboration was indispensable for the success of the conference. We also appreciate the members of the international advisory committee and the local organizing committee; in particular, we thank Dr Akiteru Takamori for designing the fascinating poster of the conference and the image for the CD of this issue. The miscellaneous duties that were necessary for the conference were carried out with the help of ICS Convention Design Inc. with special thanks due to Ms Makiko Uwato and Mr Hiroyuki Suzuki. The proceedings are published by Institute of Physics Publishing; we would like to express our deep appreciation to Ms Judith Adams for her efficient management of the proceedings. Finally, we thank all of the excellent participants who made the conference so successful.",https://doi.org/10.1088/1742-6596/32/1/e01,

It is, however, a very complex and illusive process because of the interrelation of numerous factors and effects as the nucleate process, the growth of the bubbles, the interaction between the heater’s surface with liquid and vapor, the evaporation process at the liquidvapor interface, and the transport process of vapour and hot liquid away from the heater’s surface. Among many sub-processes in boiling phenomenon, gravity can be involved and play much important roles, even enshroud the real mechanism underlying the phenomenon. Our present knowledge on nucleate pool boiling phenomenon has been built with the aid of numerous meticulous experiments in normal gravity environment on the ground where gravity is a dominant factor. Gravity strongly affects boiling phenomenon by creating forces in the systems that drive motions, shape boundaries, and compress fluids. Furthermore, the presence of gravity can mask effects that ever present but comparatively small. Advances in the understanding of boiling phenomenon have been greatly hindered by masking effect of gravity. Microgravity experiments offer a unique opportunity to study the complex interactions without external forces, such as buoyancy, which can affect the bubble dynamics and the related heat transfer. Furthermore, they can also provide a means to study the actual influence of gravity on the boiling. On the other hand, since many potential applications exist in space and in planetary neighbours due to its high efficiency in heat transfer, pool boiling in microgravity has become an increasing significant subject for investigation. Therefore, the microgravity researches will be conductive to revealing of the mechanism underlying the phenomenon, and then developing of more mechanistic models for the related applications both on Earth and in space. Research on boiling heat transfer in microgravity has a history of more than 50 years with a short pause in the 1970s and has been advanced with the development of various microgravity facilities and with increased experimental opportunities, especially in the last two decades. On the progress in this field, many comprehensive reviews and monographs are available now. Among many others, Straub (2001), Di Marco (2003), Kim (2003), and Ohta (2003a, b) summarized the experimental and theoretical works all over the world, which provided the status of this field at the beginning of our research. In the past decade, two research projects on nucleate pool boiling in microgravity have been conducted aboard the Chinese recoverable satellites by our group in the National",https://doi.org/10.5772/14090,

They threaten the values on which human life and development on Earth depend, and therefore the need for a new ethic arises. The aim of this paper, which is based on a qualitative analysis of theoretical sources, is to highlight the gravity of these crises and to present a 'new ethics', which is referred to as the ethics of the future, the ethics of responsibility for the future or the ethics of sustainability. We draw on the work of H. Jonas and other thinkers who point out that the traditional ethics, which is also referred to as anthropocentric, is no longer sufficient in today's world.  It cannot contribute to solving these crises. We argue in favour of a 'new ethics' that takes into account the distant future and relies on a new dimension of responsibility, but also of justice. It urges people to be able to take responsibility for the consequences of their actions and not to endanger the survival of humanity on the planet and also of all life. With this in mind, it should also play a part in shaping their moral character.",https://czasopisma.uksw.edu.pl/index.php/seb/article/download/13211/11602,

In many mining countries of the world today, the depth of many open pits is already 400–600 m or more. At the same time, the cost of transporting 1 ton of rock mass when operating a quarry whose depth is 400 m is 65–70 % of the total cost of extracting 1 ton of minerals. The object of research is technical devices for transport of rock masses in the technological process of development of solid useful deposits in open pit mining. The main reasons are the need to construct transport routes for them by withdrawing the sections of the rock mass on above them, as well their lifting capacity is limited because of they all do use highly energy-intensive machines for transporting rock minerals. In article has been justified a skip cable winch supplied with a wheels moving along on a railroad way by using only a gravitational counterweight device for transporting rock mass from a place of their formation to Earth surface. There have been created a prototype of a planar skip winch with four cables for practical implement in open-pit mining. The theoretical and experimental investigations of the prototype have being confirmed its performance. The created skip winch will accomplish its performancing without using any energy machines even under adverse climate conditions. Its affected would allow to make an open-pit effectiveness to soar and environmentally do friendly because of there are all but excluded any transport vehicles whether on gasoline or diesel oil",https://journals.uran.ua/eejet/article/download/285259/280443,

The number of dams erected with application of roller compacted concrete is growing year after year in the world. Roller compacted concrete is an especially dry concrete mixture with decreased content of cement and increased content of pozzolana (fly ash). The broad physico-mechanical peculiarities of roller compacted concrete depend not only on its composition but also on technology of its laying and compacting in dam. Rapid construction of gravity dams with use of equipment for earth-moving works enables the more economic construction of protective embankments. Prospects of application of roller compacted concrete during erection and restoration of existing protective embankments in regions with increased flood hazard in the west of Ukraine are considered. The use of roller compacted concrete allows reducing construction deadlines by a factor of 2–3, and, in so doing, reducing the labor content by a factor of 4–5 at the expense of full mechanization of works. Decrease in content of binder in composition of roller compacted concrete by 30–80 kg/m3 favors decrease in heat release and, correspondingly, the occurrence of temperature contraction cracks, which in its turn favors economy during construction of hydro-technical structures of hydro schemes.",https://doi.org/10.1051/e3sconf/202128003004,

Nevertheless, with the advent of satellite gravity missions, it is today possible to recover the Moho constituents (i.e. Moho depth; MD and Moho density contrast; MDC) via gravity observations based on isostatic models. Prior to using gravity observations for this application it must be stripped due to the gravitational contributions of known anomalous crustal density structures, mainly density variations of oceans, glacial ice sheets, and sediment basins (i.e., stripping gravity corrections). In addition, the gravity signals related mainly with masses below the crust must also be removed. The main purpose of this study is to estimate the siginificance of removing also Remaining Isostatic Effects (RNIEs) on gravity, i.e. gravity effects that remain after the stripping corrections. This is carried out by using CRUST19 seismic crustal model and employing Vening Meinesz-Moritz (VMM) gravimetric-isostatic model in recovering the Moho constituents on a global scale to a resolution of 1°×1°. To reach this goal, we present a new model, named MHUU22, formed by the SGGUGM2 gravitational field, Earth2014 topography, CRUST1.0 and CRUST19 seismic crustal models. Particularly, this study has its main emphasis on the RNIEs on gravity and Moho constituents to find out if we can modify the stripping gravity corrections by a specific correction of the RNIEs. The numerical results illustrate that the RMS differences between MHUU22 MD and the seismic model CRUST1.0 and least-squares combined model MOHV21 are reduced by 33% and 41% by applying the NIEs, and the RMS differences between MHUU22 MDC and the seismic model CRUST1.0 and least-squares combined model MDC21 are reduced by 41% and 23% when the above strategy for removing the RNIEs is applied. Hence, our study demonstrates that the specific correction for the RNIEs on gravity disturbance is significant, resulting in remarkable improvements in MHUU22, which more clearly visualize several crustal structures.",https://academic.oup.com/gji/advance-article-pdf/doi/10.1093/gji/ggad189/50205501/ggad189.pdf,

As the pressure of the diabatic nanofluid and/or non-continuum-flows rises, average-mean-free-path diminishes and thus, the Knudsen number lowers heading to a zero-slip wall-boundary condition with the compressible viscous flow regime in the nano scale tubes leading to Sanal flow choking [PMCID: PMC7267099; Physics of Fluids, DOI: 10.1063/5.0040440] creating a physical situation of the sonic-fluid-throat effect in the tube at a critical-total-to-static pressure ratio (CPR). Herein, we presented a closed-form-analytical-model, which is capable to predict exactly the 3D-BLB factor at the Sanal flow choking-condition of nanoscale diabatic fluid flow systems at the zero-slip-length. The innovation of Sanal flow choking model in the nanoscale fluid flow system is established herein through the entropy relation, as it satisfies all the conservation laws of nature. The exact value of the 3D-BLB factor in the sonic-fluid-throat region presented herein for each gas is a universal benchmark data for performing high-fidelity in silico, in vitro and in vivo experiments for the lucrative design optimization of nanoscale fluid flow systems in gravity and microgravity environments and also for drug discovery for prohibiting asymptomatic cardiovascular diseases in Earth and human spaceflight . Note that the relatively high and low-blood-viscosity (creating high turbulence) leads to the Sanal flow choking causing asymptomatic cardiovascular diseases. Such diseases in the cardiovascular system can be negated by maintaining the systolic-to-diastolic blood pressure ratio lower than the CPR <10.1002/gch2.202000076>. The CPR is regulated by the heat capacity ratio (HCR) of the fluid. Note that HCR is the key parameter, which could control simultaneously blood viscosity and turbulence. The physical insight of the boundary-layer-blockage persuaded nanoscale Sanal flow choking in diabatic flows presented in this article sheds light on finding solutions to numerous unresolved scientific problems in physical, chemical and biological systems carried forward over the centuries because the closed-form analytical model describing the phenomenon of Sanal flow choking is a unique scientific language of the real-world-fluid flows. More specifically, mathematical models presented herein are capable to forecast the limiting conditions of deflagration to detonation transition (DDT) in nanoscale systems and beyond with confidence. Additionally, the Sanal flow choking condition will forecast the asymptomatic-hemorrhage and acute-heart-failure https:/﻿/www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/str.52.suppl_1.P804.

On Earth, they occur in a variety of process equipment, such as petroleum production facilities, condensers and re-boilers, power systems and core cooling of nuclear power plants during emergency operation. The potential space applications include active thermal control system, power cycle, storage and transfer of cryogenic fluids, and so on. Reliable design of such systems requires a thorough understanding of the mechanism of two-phase flow, such as the phase distributions (flow patterns), pressure drops and heat transfer coefficients at different gas and liquid flow rates. Among them, flow patterns will play an important role because of strong influence of the phase distributions on pressure drops and heat transfer coefficients and thus attract more attentions of the academic and technical communities all over the world. With the aid of numerous meticulous experiments, our present knowledge on two-phase gas-liquid systems has been built. It is, however, far from complete due to the complicate influence of gravity which is a dominant factor in normal gravity. Gravity strongly affects many phenomena of two-phase gas-liquid systems by creating forces in the systems that drive motions, shape boundaries, and compress fluids. Furthermore, the presence of gravity can mask effects that ever present but comparatively small. Depending on the flow orientation and the phase velocities, gravity can significantly alter the flow patterns, and hence the pressure drops and heat transfer rates associated the flow. Advances in the understanding of two-phase flow have been greatly hindered by masking effect of gravity on the flow. Therefore, the microgravity researches will be conductive to revealing of the mechanism underlying the phenomena, and then developing of more mechanistic models for the two-phase flow and heat transfer both on Earth and in space. Research on two-phase gas-liquid flow in microgravity has a history of more than 50 years with a short pause in the 1970s and has been advanced with the development of various microgravity facilities and with increased experimental opportunities, especially in the last two decades.

Although many studies addressed gravity, the underlying biological and molecular mechanisms that are occurred in altered gravity for those epigenetics-related mechanisms, are mostly inexistent. The present study addressed the effects of hypergravity on development, behavior, gene expression, and most importantly, on the epigenetic changes in a world-wide animal model, the zebrafish (Danio rerio). To perform hypergravity experiments, a custom-centrifuge simulating the large diameter centrifuge (100 rpm ∼ 3 g) were designed and zebrafish embryos were exposed during 5 days post fertilization (dpf). Results showed a significant decrease of survival at 2 dpf but not significance in the hatching rate. Physiological and morphological alterations including fish position, movement frequency and swimming behavior showed significant changes due to hypergravity. Epigenetic studies showed a significant hypermethylation of the genome of the zebrafish larvae subjected to 5 days of hypergravity. A downregulation of the gene expression of three epigenetic-related genes (dnmt1, dnmt3, and tet1), although not significant, were further observed.

Laboratory tests (sieve analysis, Atterberg limits, specific gravity, and compaction tests) were conducted on the clay soil sample, while firing shrinkage, water absorption, unit weight and compressive strength tests were conducted on the fired clay bricks. The unit weight, firing shrinkage and compressive strength decreased with an increasing particle size of the waste glass in the fired clay bricks, while the fired clay bricks absorbed more water as the particle size of its waste glass content decreased. The use of waste glass with particle sizes less than 75 μm for stabilizing the clay was found to produce fired clay bricks with the highest compressive strength. The compressive strength of the fired clay bricks containing less than 75 μm particle sizes of waste glass was increased by 43.9% when compared with the compressive strength of the fired clay bricks having no waste glass. Consequently, waste glass with particle sizes of less than 75 μm is recommended for use in the production of fired clay bricks.

Understanding these changes requires comprehensive monitoring of water resources. Hydrogeodesy, the science that measures the Earth's solid and aquatic surfaces, gravity field, and their changes over time, delivers a range of novel monitoring tools that are complementary to traditional hydrological methods. It encompasses geodetic technologies such as Altimetry, Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR), Gravimetry, and Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS). Beyond quantifying these changes, there is a need to understand how hydrogeodesy can contribute to more ambitious goals dealing with water‐related and sustainability sciences. Addressing this need, we combine a meta‐analysis of over 3,000 articles to chart the range, trends, and applications of satellite‐based hydrogeodesy with an expert elicitation that systematically assesses the potential of hydrogeodesy. We find a growing body of literature relating to the advancements in hydrogeodetic methods, their accuracy and precision, and their inclusion in hydrological modeling, with a considerably smaller portion related to understanding hydrological processes, water management, and sustainability sciences. The meta‐analysis also shows that while lakes, groundwater and glaciers are commonly monitored by these technologies, wetlands or permafrost could benefit from a wider range of applications. In turn, the expert elicitation envisages the potential of hydrogeodesy to help solve the 23 Unsolved Questions of the International Association of Hydrological Sciences and advance knowledge as guidance toward a safe operating space for humanity. It also highlights how this potential can be maximized by combining hydrogeodetic technologies simultaneously, exploiting artificial intelligence, and accurately integrating other Earth science disciplines. Finally, we call for a coordinated way forward to include hydrogeodesy in tertiary education and broaden its application to water‐related and sustainability sciences in order to exploit its full potential.",https://doi.org/10.1029/2023wr037020,

This study explains the mechanism of differentiated distribution of objects that is found in different cities and at different scales from the estate planning to the level of geopolitics. This step is necessary to integrate the sector model of functional zoning into the theoretical apparatus of modern architecture. In animals, this mechanism is defined as magnetic sensation. The implementation of the “magnetic feeling” in human activities for the development of the space of a large city has its own specifics, taking into account both natural-scientific factors, and issues of perception and cognitive processes. In world practice, this description is undertaken for the first time. As the first factor of the “structuring effect” of a certain central object (area, green zone, water body) on the surrounding buildings, the authors accept the natural-scientific factor of gravity. The authors adhere to the point of view that a certain symbolic meaning, which is somehow fixed in culture, arises with respect to the degree of illumination, position in the sky, and the direction of movement of the Sun. These values arise on the basis of the relative positions of the analyzed territory, planet Earth and the Sun. The second factor is the person’s ability to perceive these influences and the intuitive ability to correlate them, as well as the purpose of the placed objects with the types of activities identified in philosophy and determined by the daily cycle. The result of the joint action of these two abilities is the assignment of certain objects with a greater degree of probability to certain sectors. The need to take into account two additional administrativeterritorial units (central, as well as placed outside the sector model) determines the transition from a purely sector model to an integer ten-element functional topological model. In this regard, the development of a sector model of functional zoning is accompanied by an appeal to ten-element models of a generalized description of extremely complex processes that are found in antiquity similarly to the sources of the sector model of functional zoning.",https://doi.org/10.2991/assehr.k.210225.059,

This value is independent on Earth’s tides and others disturbances, therefore it can be used as basic quantity for many applications. Value W0 represents mean sea surface. W0 was developed from data of satellite altimetry which monitores actual ocean’s surface. This value is one of the four fundamental geodetic constants. This value has been accepted worldwide and is included to the International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service Conventions (IERS Conventions) 2003, 2007. This value defines in principle parameters of level ellipsoid which best fit to the surface defined by W0. The body of this level ellipsoid produces normal gravity. We developed other important parameters for determination of the density deviations (VTT technology), i.e. values of normal gravity ge at the equator and gp at the pole on the elipsoid E0 and the value of parameter β. All parameters above used for development of VTT technology are supplied by GPS/leveling data that enable to create so-called density deviation maps at any place in the World. In comparison with gravity anomalies, the density deviations represent more precise density anomalous places in the Earth’s crust. A construction of density deviation map is applied at two from geologically different regions—the Western Carpathians and the Central African Rifts.",http://www.scirp.org/journal/PaperDownload.aspx?paperID=31527,

Physicians involved in space medicine play a pivotal role in understanding the effects of space flight on humans as well as mitigating problems associated with space flight, and managing any health effects that might develop on a mission (1). In addition to the many physiological effects, space medicine includes practicing medicine in this extreme environment. Prevention, diagnosis and treatment must be taken into consideration. It is therefore important to understand the mechanisms of altered human physiological functions in space to establish a new “normal” in reduced microgravity, and to then discover new ways of treating astronauts in space. The space environment has a vast array of effects on almost every component of normal human physiology: cardiopulmonary function (2, 3) neurophysiology (2) bone and mineral metabolism (3-5) muscle structure and function (4, 5) hematological and immunologic function (4, 6) biological effects of radiation (7) circadian rhythm (7) psychological effects (8) It is critical to launch a new era of medicine in Canada. There are many applications of space medicine to medical concerns on Earth. The physiological changes observed in space can shed light on common diseases supporting developments of treatments. First, osteoporosis is a public health concern affecting menopausal women, and the complete absence of microgravity is a model of accelerated osteoporosis. Osteoporosis is a slow, progressive disease except in situations such as short and long-duration space missions and immobilization (9). New treatments addressing these issues and further prevention can be a significant benefit to all women suffering from this disease. Motion sickness is also an obstacle for astronauts and cosmonauts living in microgravity. Pharmaceuticals aimed to prevent space motion sickness can prove useful to terrestrial motion sickness, which affects individuals on long journeys by air, sea, and motor vehicles (10). Additionally, reduced gravity influences the cardiovascular system leading to an understanding of cardiovascular functions in different circumstances. Prolonged hospitalizations can lead to adaptation problems requiring rehabilitation for the cardiovascular system and for muscles. Exercise equipment specifically designed for astronauts in space may be a useful addition to rehabilitation medical equipment (10). Currently, there is no Canadian residency for aerospace medicine. However, the Canadian Space Agency (CSA) does offer an aerospace medicine medical elective for fourth year medical students or residents. The CSA sends selected students to the Johnson Space Center or the Kennedy Space Center to promote awareness of this branch of medicine and to encourage career pursuits in aerospace medicine (11). In spite of this, if a student hopes to pursue a career as an aerospace physician, the only residencies offered are in the USA. The Centre for Altitude, Space and Extreme Environment Medicine (CASE Medicine) offers a medical elective in space medicine and extreme environment physiology for medical students at University College London. Finally, some students and residents interested in this field complete a diploma of space studies at the International Space University. The only two American civilian universities that offer aerospace medicine programs are the University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB) and Wright State University. UTMB focuses more on space medicine whereas the Wright State program centers on aviation medicine. These are competitive programs accepting few candidates from around the world on a per-year basis (12, 13). The space shuttle is retiring in 2010 and it will be making way for the new Ares Launch Vehicles, which will return humans to the Moon and to other destinations (14). Canada has made significant contributions to the development and enhancement of space exploration through pioneering technology; however, new aerospace medicine initiatives should be supported, such as a Canadian fellowship or residency in aerospace medicine. Even though Canada has a small number of astronauts, Canada should establish a training program to train specialists in both an occupational and research setting. There are still many medical challenges associated with space flight, and increased Canadian participation in aerospace medicine research would help in understanding and mitigating the effects of space environment on human physiology. Furthermore, applications of this research could also be beneficial to Earth-related issues. Although Canada should support new training initiatives, political pressure is geared towards addressing the shortage of physicians. For that reason, students interested in this field must be prepared to pursue a unique training path that might not initially include space medicine, but it would be great if students were supported in these pursuits. It is also essential to optimize the health and safety of astronauts before, during, and after space travel. The future of space medicine is for those who would like to embark on a journey to become a pioneer, a student, a teacher, and an explorer in pursuit of understanding the effects of space travel on human physiology, practicing medicine in extreme environments, and applying new knowledge acquired to health care on Earth.

Post-impact, the huge kinetic energy is spread into stellar bodies associated with the light flux under strong mutual connections or gravitational bundle. Einstein’s general relativity theory including the gravitational field can be expressed under a condensed tensor formulation as E  R − Rg =  T where E defines the geometry via a curved space-time structure (R) over the gravity field (1/2Rg), embedded in a matter distribution T The fundamental (ten non-linear partial differential) equations of the gravitational field are a kind of the space-time machine using the curvature of a four-dimensional space-time to engender the gravity field carrying away material structures. Gravity according to the curved space-time theory is not seen as a gravitational force, but it manifests itself in the relativistic form of the space-time curvature needing the constancy of the light speed. But the constant light velocity makes the tidal wave/pulsating energy, a characteristic of solar energy, impossible. The Einstein’s field equation, expressed in terms of tensor formulation along with the constant light speed postulate, needs two special space-time tensors (curvature and torsion) in 4 dimensions, where for the simplicity the torsion/twist tensor is less well approximated (Bianchi identity) leading to a constant/frozen gravity (twist-free gravity).The non-zero torsion tensor plays a significant physical role in the planetary dynamics as a finest gear of a planet, where its spinning rotation is directly connected to the own work and space-time structure (or clock), controlled by light fluctuations (or tidal effect of gravity). The spin correction of Einstein’s gravitational field refers to the curvature-torsion effect coupled with fluctuating light speed. The mutual curvature-torsion bundle self-sustained by the quantum fluctuations of light speed engenders helical gravitational wave fields of a quantum nature where bodies orbit freely in the light speed field (cosmic wind). In contrast to the Einstein’s field equation describing a gravitational frozen field, a quantum tidal gravity model is proposed in the paper.",https://doi.org/10.13111/2066-8201.2021.13.1.5,

French sinology takes a special place in the history of the sinological studies development. It was France that became the first country where the transformation of missionary sinology, which was common among a limited circle of researchers (mainly in a religious sphere), into the academic scientific discipline, which had already been taught and studied at a professional level in academic institutions, occurred. The Parisian type of sinology used to dominate the entire world for a long time, including such powerful centers of Chinese studies as Germany, Great Britain, the USA, and China itself. In order to form a complete picture of sinology development in France, the authors singled out and analyzed three historical periods covering the entire history of Chinese studies development, starting from its birth and flourishment to the process of stagnation. Modern scientific communication traditionally uses visual narratives, such as comics, for education, presentation of scientific achievements to a mass audience, and as an object of research. In the article by Oksana Hudoshnyk and Oleksandr P. Krupskyi, offers a three-level characterization of the interaction of comic culture and science in a diachronic aspect. Attention is focused not only on the chronological stages of these intersections, the expression of the specifics of the interaction is offered against the background of scientific and public discussions that accompany the comics–science dialogue to this day. Emphasis is placed on the unique phenomenon of the simultaneous concordance of various stages of the dialogue between comics and science, on the prolonged replication of successful inventions into modern experience, and the active testing of known narratives at new levels of a scientific presentation. The next paper assesses the topicality of Vernadsky's concept of the noosphere, coined over almost twenty years starting in the early 20th century. Emphasizing the uniqueness of Vernadsky's concept of the noosphere as the transformation of the biosphere by a man using reason, we concentrate on the assessment of the utopian or realistic nature of his vision of the future of humanity. Based on the philosophical case-studies analysis, it identifies the ideological roots of the noosphere concept, the development of views on the concept in time, the role of reason and scientific thinking, the opinions of its supporters and critics, and Moiseev's related concept of co-evolution. Lectures de Potentia Restitutiva or Of Spring: Explaining the Power of Springing Bodies (1678) is an important book for the history of science. This book is better known for Hooke’s presentation of the law that bears his name. In the article by Isadora Monteiro, seeks to study the Lectures de Potentia Restitutiva once again to better understand Hooke’s thoughts about the rule which bears his name and his conception of gravity, which the author considered a force. Here Hooke’s definitions of body and motion will be presented, as well as his actual objective when he formulated the so-called Hooke’s Law. As we will see, Hooke intended to create a “philosophical scale” to measure the gravitational attraction between bodies. By considering his previous publications, such as An attempt to prove the motion of the Earth from Observations or Micrographia: or some Physiological Descriptions of Minute Bodies, or even unpublished works such as On the inflection of a direct motion into a curve by supervening Attractive principle, it becomes clear that Hooke was already opening a path toward an understanding of gravity before Newton’s Principia (1687) were published. By taking into account the controversy between Isaac Newton and Robert Hooke, we also intend to strengthen the idea that Hooke was an indispensable contributor to the elaboration of a law of universal gravitation. In 1915, the first occupational therapy school was founded by Jane Addams at Hull House (Chicago, USA). In that process, Addams inspired the first generation of occupational therapists, especially Eleanor Clarke Slagle. Thus, in the article by Rodolfo Morrisonseeks to highlight the contribution of Jane Addams to the development of Occupational Therapy through an in-depth bibliographic review, from primary sources. The next article presents the results of a study of the features of biographical and prosopographic materials about famous mathematicians and natural scientists, published in one of the most authoritative journals “Bulletin of Experimental Physics and Elementary Mathematics”, which was published in Kyiv and Odesa during 1886–1917. In fact, the journal was an unofficial periodical printed branch of the Mathematical Department of the Novorossiysk Society of Naturalists. The aim of the next research is to study the policy efforts conducted by the Indonesian government since the beginning of independence in 1945 to present, in advancing science and technology and innovation. A content analysis approach is employed to identify each stipulated regulation in Indonesia in the form of Laws, Government Regulations, Presidential Regulations, Presidential Decrees, and Presidential Instructions. There are 78 regulations in the field of science and technology and innovation that are analyzed. The results of the analysis are described based on the emergence of regulations and institutional implications generated as part of the ecosystem. In the article by Ihor Annienkov, based on the problem-chronological, comparative-historical, historiographical, and source-research methods, as well as the method of actualization, identifies the extent of borrowing foreign design and technological solutions in the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic for projecting electrical machines in the second half of the 1930s, as well as the reasons for the absence of unambiguous information in historiography regarding the existence of this phenomenon in the republic at this chronological stage. The publication provides a general assessment of the quality of scientific support for the processes of creating electrical machines, establishes the ways of fulfilling the scientific-technical borrowings that were studiedand the dynamics of their development, analyzes their role in the growth of the technical level of products of the Ukrainian electrical machine-building branch. In the article by Mykola Ruban and Andrii Fomin, attempts to investigate the historical circumstances of the mastering and development of the industrial production of rolling stock in Ukraine from 1991 to 2021. In the course of the scientific development of the proposed research, materials from mass-circulation newspapers, industry publications of railway transport, as well as technical studies of employees of manufacturing plants were used. The next discusses the conditions and prerequisites for choosing the location of the plant; considers the stage of the establishment (foundation) of the plant; examines the stage of plant construction and equipping it with technological facilities in detail; analyzes the development and establishment of the plant between 1897 and 1914. A brief analysis of locomotive designs produced by the Kharkiv Locomotive Plant from 1897 to 1914 has been made. The article shows the significance of Consultative Congresses of Traction Engineers for the development of railway machinery both at Kharkiv Locomotive Plant and for the entire railway industry. The purpose of next study is to highlight the peculiarities of the development of the Russian aviation industry during the First World War. The focus is on analyzing production programs and matching their quantitative and qualitative parameters to war requirements. Production plans of leading Russian aviation factories as well as qualitative and quantitative parameters of products have been analyzed in the article.",https://www.hst-journal.com/index.php/hst/article/download/538/393,

It might be surprising, but in my opinion this is something worth to know and study it in details in order to help our world and too safe our life. Why I am claiming that?

Marine pollutants are transported, mixed and diffused in the ocean, which means the understanding and modelling of marine transport is key for mitigation purposes (Moulton et al., 2022). Additional to large scale and planetary currents that play a major role in marine transport, free surface waves, internal gravity waves in density stratified fluids and the Coriolis force due to the rotation of the Earth are also fundamental drivers of transport that need to be accounted for. The fundamental fluid mechanics processes associated with these are often not resolved in large-scale models, but are instead included in a parametrised form. However, some fundamental processes associated with wave-induced currents (e.g., Stokes drift) in rotating, density-stratified fluids with a free surface remain unclear and untested. In addition, parametrisation for different environments, forcings and time scales must be developed and tested before being implemented into models for them to reliably predict transport, accumulation and storage of marine pollutants. For this purpose, the Delta Transport Processes Laboratory (DTPLab) is being developed at TUDelft Hydraulic Engineering Laboratory. This laboratory pioneers the combined experimental study of surface waves, density stratification and Coriolis forces in a single laboratory. The DTPLab was designed with a multi- users and purposes vision, with interchangeable facilities and state-of-the-art measurement devices. This paper presents the DTPLab facilities (under construction) and equipment that make this laboratory unique in the world, and describes, as an example of what is feasible, a novel experiment that will be performed in this lab.",https://proceedings.open.tudelft.nl/coastlab24/article/download/757/738,

We developed three‐dimensional numerical simulations, using a ridge‐flank hydrothermal system on Earth as a reference, to test the influence of ocean world gravity on fluid and heat transport. Simulations represented the upper ∼4–5 km below the seafloor and explored ranges of: heat input at the base, aquifer thickness, depth, and permeability, and gravity values appropriate for Earth, Europa, and Enceladus. We tested when a hydrothermal siphon could be sustained and quantified consequent circulation temperatures, flow rates, and advective heat output. Calculations illustrate a trade‐off in energy between the reduction of buoyancy at lower gravity, which tends to reduce the primary forces driving fluid circulation, and the concomitant reduction in secondary convection, which consumes available energy. When a siphon was sustained under lower gravity, circulation temperatures tended to increase modestly (which should lead to more extensive geochemical reactions), whereas mass flow rates and advective heat output tended to be reduced. Deeper subseafloor circulation resulted in higher temperatures and flow rates, with a deeper, thin aquifer being more efficient in removing heat from the rocky interior. Water‐rock ratios were lower when gravity was lower, as was the efficiency of heat extraction, whereas the time required to circulate the volume of an ocean‐world's ocean through the seafloor increased. This may help to explain how small ocean worlds could sustain hydrothermal circulation for a long time despite limited heat sources.",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1029/2023JE008202,

For example, in some regimes physical testing cannot be performed and/or the cost of performing extensive validation in a physical testbed is prohibitively expensive. The design exploration space for project risk reduction, first principles simulation and data mining to discover new physical phenomena of interest, the need to produce high quality animations in a timely fashion, and design-trade studies for engineering analysis are also driving JPL’s needs for High Capability Computing (HCC) to meet our mission challenges. High Capability Computing involves the use of parallel computer systems (those with hundreds to thousands of processors) to solve a large problem more rapidly than a desktop computer system and/or to solve many variations of a specific problem simultaneously. This is an enabling capability for addressing the most advanced problems in science and engineering. High Capability Computing also includes development of computational technologies that both improve the fidelity of existing applications and spawn the generation of new ones. JPL maintains HCC systems within labs at the group, flight project, and institutional level. Furthermore, with various partners, JPL develops world-class science and engineering analysis software. Many, particularly Earth observing missions, have used HCC in some form since JPL acquired initial systems in the early 1990s. Although one of the main drivers at that time was computational electromagnetics modeling even a few planetary missions, such as Magellan (1989), later benefited from HCC for comnbining radar surface topography data with digital elevation maps to produce visualizations of virtual flyovers of the Venetian surface. Such efforts span from re-processing of past data sets to very recent work such as the calculation of gravity fields, and other measurements, from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) mission. As the technology and our infrastructure advanced so have our capabilities.

For one thing, it has grown out of a long history of public service (e.g., weather forecasting for the public and private sectors; oceanography and marine meteorology for naval applications). For another, public interest in climatic events — ice ages, nuclear winter, El Nino, sea-level change — is sufficiently high that climate is nearly continuously in the news and has been for years. However, compared to many other branches of science — biomedicine and nuclear physics come to mind — the community of scientists who investigate the workings of Earth’s climate has tended to avoid the spotlight. They did this with fair success until recently, when global warming came along. Now, they are thrust into the glare of public scrutiny due to the controversy over projections of the rise of global temperatures associated with increases of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Earth’s climate is an extraordinarily complicated physical, chemical, and biological system. Simulating its behavior is both challenging and fraught with uncertainty due to chaotic processes within the climate system itself and lack of knowledge about future atmospheric composition as well as both known and unknown deficiencies in the computer models used for the simulations. When public scrutiny becomes part of the equation, matters become even more complicated, because explaining the complexities of the climate’s behavior to the lay public is a challenge unto itself. Unfortunately, this challenge is not always met successfully. For example, there is widespread, interchangeable use of the terms “greenhouse effect” and “global warming,” an error that introduces only confusion into the ongoing discussion. It is perhaps worthwhile to emphasize the difference between the two here. What we call, with some imprecision, the greenhouse effect is a climate system process, in which gases in Earth’s atmosphere absorb and re-radiate the heat given off by Earth’s surface and by the atmosphere itself. The net effect of this is to insulate the planet and to keep the place livable. Without our atmosphere, Earth’s average temperature would be around –18oC (0oF) rather than the balmy 15oC (59oF) or so that we enjoy today. The greenhouse effect is as real as gravity and, in many respects, more well understood at the quantum level. Global warming, on the other hand, is one possible result of the net effect of all climate system processes when the system is perturbed somehow.

Further, in contrast to traditional analysis conducted in the excitation domain, this study focuses on the polar motion domain and incorporates the wavelet analysis technique. Our findings reveal some intriguing phenomena: Between 2006 and 2020, the cryosphere contributed an average amplitude of approximately 4.85 mas to CW, equivalent to 5.05%, with its impact escalating to about 11 mas from 2018 to 2022, representing a fourfold rise in its contribution ratio to approximately 20%. This marked surge can be attributed to the more erratic glacier mass balance results from ongoing climate change. Moreover, there is a pronounced decrease in the CW signal post‐2018, which starkly contrasts with cryospheric contribution, suggesting a potential linkage to climate change yet warrants further investigation.",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1029/2024GL108992,

For this world needs to start using renewable energy resources. The following project shows how electricity can be generated using gravity in simplest possible way. Mechanical components like Spur gears, chain and mass provide input to an electrical circuit through a generator motor. Every time you lift the weight, gravitational potential energy is converted into electrical energy for 12 seconds in this model. The power generation from gravity is cheaper and bio-efficient as compared to solar and other renewable energy sources. In recent times due to effects of pollution and global warming there is a need for generating power from renewable sources. The reason for generating power using gravity is that it is available all over the Earth, abundant and consistent too. In this project, the gravitational energy of a heavy particle is converted to the electrical energy. When the heavy particle falls down from a higher altitude to a lower one, its potential energy is converted into the kinetic energy. Then this energy is converted to electricity by using a synchronous motor. With the increasing of the altitude of the load, the lighting time increases. If load increases, power production also increases, but the lighting time decreases.",https://doi.org/10.3126/jie.v15i1.27726,

This variation is generally inconsequential to physiological systems and inhabitants traveling within these elevations rapidly acclimate. Only about 0.004% of the world’s population lives above 5000 m (0.53 atm or 0.537 bar), where the fall in atmospheric pressure reduces the oxygen molecules present, now at nearly one-half (~11.2%) that at sea level, and thus reduces the driving pressure for gas exchange in the lungs (Tremblay and Ainslie, 2021). Extending further in elevation physiological responses and adaptation, say to high altitude flight and space travel, can only be achieved using specialized life support systems. Another extreme occurs below sea level. Due to ambient pressure and CO2 buildup a human subject on average can breathe air through a tube at a depth of less than 1 m underwater. Air can still be used to a depth of about 60 m in recreational diving using specialized equipment to regulate the pressured air from a tank. Below that level non-recreational open-sea dives to a record depth 534 m (“Hydra 8” program) have been performed using exotic heliox (helium and O2) and hydrox (hydrogen and O2) mixtures or even deeper, e.g. ~700 m, using an atmospheric diving suit. Going a step further one diver, Theo Mavrostomos, spent 2 hours under 71.1 atm of pressure in an onshore hyperbaric chamber in a simulated dive to 701 m using hydreliox (exotic breathing gas mixture of helium, oxygen and hydrogen). Challenges to human habitation are mounting even at our “sweet” zone of sea level.

We have lived for more than three centuries in the old academic paradigm, which claimed that the world existed forever and no one created it. In the 20th century, as a result of discoveries, first of all, in the field of quantum physics, there was formed the hypothesis that our Universe, including the Solar System, arose as a result of the Big Bang. Today we are on the verge of creating a theory of everything, which would be based on the superstring theory that can unite the theory of general relativity of Albert Einstein and the theory of quantum mechanics. It is assumed that the aforementioned theory will unite four main Universe interactions: gravity, strong and weak nuclear interactions, and electromagnetism. This should give answers to questions that have worried humanity for many years, for example: “How and where did the Universe originate from? What is its true nature? How did life begin on earth? What does the anthropic principle mean, according to which man appeared and evolved?” Purpose. The purpose of the article is to disclose the author's vision of human development in the system of personality formation. To compare how these ideas are described in the existing and innovative knowledge systems. Methods. Was used a system of theoretical and empirical research methods to achieve the goal and reveal the relevance of the topic: analysis, deduction, induction, modeling, abstraction, as well as specific research methods, such as observation and experiment. Results . The article reveals the essence of the concept of ""consciousness"" and gives serious remarks to the traditional theory of human cognition. The article contains rationale of the use of innovation ontological paradigm and introducing a new scientific direction - quantum psychology. Originality. The essence of fundamental differences between ideological approaches in traditional and innovative systems of knowledge about a person has been revealed. Conclusion. We are convinced that there is necessity to introduce in the nearest future a new scientific direction - quantum psychology. The proposed direction is not an alternative to the existing system (psychoanalysis, behavioralism, Erickson’s direction, gestalt-direction, hypnosis, etc.). It is complementary to the current system of psychological science and logically fills the gaps that were not previously taken into account. Our strategy is to create the direction of quantum psychology. It coincides with the ideas of such prominent scientists in the area as Robert Wilson, Stephen Volynsky, John von Neumann, and others. In our opinion, the basis of the system of knowledge in the field of quantum psychology should be provided by harmoniously combined experience from the spheres of the traditional branches of Western psychology, the philosophy of the East (Eastern traditions), quantum mechanics, and a new philosophical paradigm based on the ontological model represented by the formula ""Consciousness - Information - Energy - Matter. "" In this scientific direction, Consciousness as the only and main substance of the Genesis of the Universe, in contrast to the psyche, which in modern psychology is its main subject, must possess an exceptional and appropriate place for in the multidimensional human life, as well as a basic subject of psychology.",https://doi.org/10.33099/2617-1783/2018-2/144-151,

A fundamentally new approach is proposed, on the basis of which new calculated dependences and their numerical values were found for the first time to determine the action of the forces of gravity of planetary systems. They are confirmed by comparative calculations of the new gravitational parameters of the Earth, which agree well with its known parameters. Conclusions. For the first time, new scientific data have been obtained, which significantly expand the range of parameters of the gravitational field of the planets and the level of knowledge of the fundamentals of the material world.",https://archive.interconf.center/index.php/2709-4685/article/download/328/349,

There is no dam failure in history of Switzerland. Swiss dam safety surveillance mode is highly praised by International Commission on Large Dams and is of enlightening and reference significance to the safety management of reservoir dams in China. Based on introducing the basic information of dams in Switzerland and safety surveillance concept, this paper systematically analyzes the safety surveillance mode of dams in Switzerland, digs the safety surveillance characteristics of dams in Switzerland. Through contrastive analysis of the dam safety management modes in China and Switzerland, building safety culture, defining management responsibilities, enhancing surveillance and inspection, making innovative management mode, attaching importance to emptying requirements, perfecting metal structure testing system and a series of experience in Switzerland are put forward for China’s reference. BASIC INFORMATION OF RESERVOIR DAMS IN SWITZERLAND There are 1200 reservoirs of all kinds in Switzerland. Most of them are dominated by the types of retaining water and generating electricity and those in minority are oriented by flood protection, irrigation, sand interception and other social benefits. Switzerland began building industrial dams in the beginning of 19th century, damming industry had further development in 1930s, and reached its climax in 1950~1970 with a batch of high dams and large reservoirs built in succession[1]. Grande Dixence built in 1961, with dam height of 285m, is still keeping the highest world record of concrete gravity dam at present. Reservoirs in Switzerland can be classified into small reservoirs and large ones according to the project scale[2]. Large reservoirs refer to the reservoirs with dam height above 25m or dam height above 15m and storage capacity above 50,000 m3, or dam height above 10m and storage capacity above 100,000 m3, or storage capacity above 500,000 m3; small reservoirs refer to those with dam height above 10m or dam height above 5m and storage capacity no less than 50,000 m3. There are 227 large reservoirs in Switzerland, and the rest 1000 ones are small reservoirs. In order to further enhance the safety surveillance of dams in lager scales, the concept of outsize reservoirs is further emphasized within the large reservoir scope in management. This kind of reservoirs refers to the reservoirs with dam height no less than 40m or dam height no less than 10m and storage capacity no less than 1,000,000 m3. Classified according to dam type, gravity dams account for 35%, earth dams account for 32%, arch dams account for 24%, buttress dams account for 1% and the rest 8% are water gates, which are also supervised as reservoir dams. Switzerland preliminarily established the legal framework for dam safety management in 1943. Dam Law in 1998 (WRFA) [3]was enforced and was perfected year by year hereafter and reaches current situation. At present, the main laws and regulations on safety surveillance of reservoir dam in Switzerland are Dam Law and Dam Regulation (WRFO) [4]. To carry out Dam Regulation, Federal Office of Energy published dam safety criterion, structure safety, flood control safety, earth5th International Conference on Civil, Architectural and Hydraulic Engineering (ICCAHE 2016) © 2016. The authors Published by Atlantis Press 798 quake-resistance standard assessment, dam monitoring and maintenance, contingency plan and a series of guidelines. Grading supervision similar to that of China is also implemented for reservoir dam safety in Switzerland. 227 large reservoirs are in the charge of Swiss Federal Office of Energy (SFOE) and the rest 1000 small reservoirs are in the charge of state government reservoir dam safety supervision organs. Swiss Federal Office of Energy (SFOE) exercises indirect supervision on the supervisory behaviors of small reservoirs conducted by governmental dam safety supervision organs.. SAFETY CONCEPT OF RESERVOIR DAM IN SWITZERLAND The safety management objective of dams in Switzerland is to control initial, operation and residual risks and ensure the dam safety and effective respond to emergency circumstances[5]. This concept can be realized in three aspects (see Fig.1). Fig.1 Safety Concept of Reservoir Dam in Switzerland (1) Structure safety. Supervision organs examine construction plans in pre-construction phase of dams, make whole process supervision of dam construction behaviors in the construction and implementation, and examine initial filling to ensure the engineering structure safety and provide foundation for the official operation in later phase. (2) Safety surveillance. In the whole-life process of dams, the owners must exercise effective safety surveillance, find defects and abnormal forms in time, prevent possible dangers, and submit safety report to the supervision organs on a regular basis. The supervision organs should have dam monitoring under control and comply with the relevant legal provisions, should meet dam safety requirements at any time, and may require the owners to take appropriate measures to ensure the dam structure safety. (3) Emergency plan. Although safety surveillance is carried out continuously, the dam safety cannot be ensured forever due to inevitable abnormal behaviors, natural accidents or destructive activities, etc. Once unexpected accidents happen, all measures must be taken to avoid endangering the safety of personnel, property and environment. Therefore, the contingency plans should be prepared to prevent the safety problems that may appear to control the residual risks. SURVEILLIANCE MODE OF SWITZERLAND Dam safety surveillance system Swiss dam safety surveillance system is divided into four layers (see Fig.2), respectively are L1 dam caretakers, L2 qualified engineers, L3 senior experts and L4 supervisors. Through the continuous inspection and tests of L1 dam caretakers, monitoring and assessment of L2 qualified engineers each year or at any time, deep safety assessment of L3 senior experts once every five years, supervision and management of L4 supervisors and interaction between the personnel of all layers and their constant operation, this system guarantees the continuous effect of dam safety surveillance.",https://download.atlantis-press.com/article/25863141.pdf,

The subject of the meeting was the rheology of foams and emulsions, with two aims: to provide a forum for the discussion of new results in the field and to introduce the subject to rheologists used to working with rather more “traditional” materials. The programme attracted over 50 delegates from a range of academic disciplines and industries. Although the number of people who study the rheology of these highly structured fluids is perhaps small compared to those working with materials of a polymeric nature, it is clear that foams and emulsions are of interest to mathematicians, physicists, chemical engineers and food and materials scientists, among many others, and industries such as mining, petroleum and personal care. A foam is a complex fluid with a rather precise internal structure: Plateau’s rules indicate that soap films always meet three-fold in Plateau borders, the liquid-carrying channels that run between the bubbles. In turn, these borders meet tetrahedrally. The material, although disordered, is not disorganized. Before proceeding, we should also point out that concentrated emulsions have the same structure and behave in much the same way as foams, and for many purposes may even be preferable. This cellular structure gives an elastic response at low strain, and as strain, or strain-rate, increases, there is plastic yielding and then viscous flow. With the addition of surface chemistry, this is indeed a rich field for research. The first lecture, given by Jan Cilliers (Imperial) on “How bubbles float the world economy”, emphasized the importance of foams for ore-separation, and thus the effect that foam research can have on wealth creation. Cilliers described model experiments and simulations of the combined liquid, solid and gas motion in a flotation froth as the gangue flows up and over a weir to collect and purify the mineral particles. Although it is difficult to persuade mining companies to implement even the small changes to processes suggested by research, slight increases in efficiency have a remarkable effect on profit. Such improvements are even more worthwhile in the current climate, where the cost of minerals such as copper is becoming ever higher. The following talk was partly motivated by another industrial application in which foam plays an important role: the use of foams for enhanced oil recovery. Sylvie Cohen-Addad (Paris Est) described the viscoelastic response of aqueous foams containing a proportion of solid particles. Even in the linear regime, the particles increase the shear modulus of the foam, and she described this in terms of a rigidity percolation model. The effect is confirmed by Surface Evolver (SE) simulations on ordered dry foams with solid inclusions. A related presentation by Tudur Davies (Aberystwyth) described SE simulations of the interaction of circular particles descending through a foam under gravity.

Drought frequently occurs in North China and is the most damaging disaster in this region owing to its large-scale impact on hydrology and ecosystems. This is the main reason that China implemented the world-famous South-to-North Water Diversion (SNWD) project. However, quantifying the drought-induced water deficit at a regional scale is still a significant challenge. Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellites monitor temporal variations in the Earth’s gravitational potential and provide quality data sets for water storage analysis. In this study, we quantify the water deficit over North China in the context of the implementation of the SNWD project by focusing on a recent drought event, the 2009/10 drought, and identifying its onset, persistence, and recovery. As confirmed with ground-measured and land surface modelling data sets, GRACE can successfully capture temporal variations in total water storage. Total water storage shows a declining trend, reaching a low point during the 2009/10 drought with a water storage deficit of up to 25 km3 (~ 22 mm). Groundwater storage shows a similar pattern, with a trend of −6.97 mm yr−1. Together with the water deficit, vegetation growth is substantially restricted, as indicated by a reduction in the leaf area index. The amount of water transfer by the SNWD project can roughly meet the water deficit in North China but the effectiveness of the SNWD will depends on specific water configuration strategies.",https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-2016-313,

It is a great honor for us Chinese, but also a great challenge for the project staff through the whole process. Of the characteristics of automatic navigation control, the moon landing stage is considered to be the most important test. In this paper, the dynamic model based on the uniform sphere three-dimensional soft landing model is established to searching Chang'e-3’s optimal trajectory in the main reduction process along the moon landing stage. Also, the computer simulation method and the exhaustive method are employed. Compared with the searched video information, the accuracy of the results is verified. Introduction Chang'e-3 launched on December 12, 2013 and successfully landed on the moon two days later. It is the first time for china to send a spacecraft land on the surface of an extraterrestrial body and conduct surveys on the moon. Furthermore, the success makes China the third country to carry out such a rover mission after the United States and former Soviet Union. For there is no air on the moon, parachute is unavailable. Chang'e-3 has to rely on a variable thrust engine, to complete the soft landing task in the mid-course corrections, the braking at perilune, the powered lowering, and the hovering period. At this stage, the measurement and control technology can not keep up with the operation of the satellite. As a consequence, Chang'e-3, armed with the program set in advance, depend entirely on autonomous navigation control, reducing the height, determining the landing site, achieving the soft landing and a series of key actions. In this paper, the dynamic model based on the uniform sphere three-dimensional soft landing model is established to solve Chang'e-3’s optimal trajectory in the main reduction section. The optimization goal is the fuel consumption, and is transferred to the seeking for the shortest time, for the largest thrust remains the same in the main reduction stage. Then, the exhaustive method list three kinds of movements: constant horizontal thrust, constant speed reverse thrust and constant speed reverse thrust after constant speed reverse resultant force., and only to find that just the last one state meet the key position after simulation. Then, the computer simulation method is employed, and the movement of the main reduction process is given. Compared with the searched video information, the accuracy of the results is verified.

Glaciers are constantly moving and melting because of internal and external pressure and gravity under its own weight. Although extensive glaciers systems lies on different mountain ranges of the landforms in the world i.e. more than seven thousand glaciers lies in Africa, Andes, Alaska, Canada, Greenland, Eurasia, European Alps, New Zeeland, Nepal, Norway, Pakistan, South America and in North America Continent. In the mountain landforms, Pakistan has more glacial ice in the Himalayan Range, Karakorum Range and Koh-Hindu-Kush Range. Glaciers also exist in southern hemisphere in Antarctic Region, in Northern Hemisphere in Arctic Region, Greenland and remaining occurs in the landforms of mountain regions. Glaciers exhibit the different wave like motions that mostly occur internally thus resulting the glacier surge, and waves of velocity. When the glaciers and ice sheet gains a large eroded material through the accumulation of snow above the equilibrium line, the glacier mass is lost through the ablation process and melting water runoff towards the down slope at lowest elevations below the equilibrium line that results the formation of accumulation area, alluvial fan stratification, alluvial plans, arête, askers, braided streams, cirques, crevasses, drumlins, fjords, fracture zones, glacial valleys, ice aprons, and ice bergs. Glaciers are among the oldest and coldest ecosystems on earth that together support the psychrophilic taxa and also impart a requisite water source to shape the downstream ecosystems. But due to global warming and rapid rise in the tropical climate change, melting of tropical glaciers, the fast ablation has contributed the shrinking of global glaciers thus causing the major biological, environmental and human consequences. Subsequently, mountain erosion results the transportation of debris, silt up, floods, and land sliding, raised the global environmental issues. The study includes the core concept of glaciers and melting glaciers effecting the global environments.

These are the chemical ele ments, from hydrogen to uranium. Hydrogen, found with oxygen in our plentiful oceanic water, is by far the most abundant element in the universe; iron is the most common of the heavier elements. All the combinations of atoms in the complex chem ical com pounds studied by chemists on Earth are also possible components of the objects that we see in the cos mos. Although almost all of the regions that we astronomers study are so hot that the more com pli cated compounds would be torn apart by the heat, some surprisingly unstable organic molecules, such as cyanopolyynes, have been detected in cold re gions of space with very low density of matter. Nev ertheless, the astronomical world is simpler than the chemical world of the laboratory or the real bio log ical world. But the enormous spatial and temporal extent of the cosmos allows us–and in fact forces us–to ask questions that would seem offbeat to a chemist. Where do the chemical elements come from? Precisely how, where, and when were they made? Do the abundances of the elements change with time? Does alternative “matter” that is not made of the or dinary chemical elements exist and exert gravity in the universe?

It contains copper, gold, silver, uranium, and rare earths, and in terms of present market prices, is valued at over $100 billion, making it one of the world's most valuable deposits. When brought on line in 1988, the projected production of 4,000 tons/year of U3O8 as a by-product will have a significant impact on the world uranium market. The deposit is hosted in middle Proterozoic rocks in a deep, small basin within the Gawler craton, and is overlain by 350 m (1,148 ft) of unmineralized late Proterozoic miogeoclinical Adelaidean sediments on the Stuart shelf. The nearest host rocks are no closer than 150 km (93 mi). According to Western Mining Corporation, the discovery resulted from regional considerations, with target selection being decided by nearly superimposed gravity and magnetic highs identified from detailed geophysical studies. The present study is a synthesis and integration of large amounts of geological, geophysical, and geochemical data available from the South Australian Department of Mines and Energy, mining companies, and universities. The presence of a probable analog deposit at Mt. Painter, approximately 270 km (168 mi) east-northeast of Olympic Dam, available for field study and sampling, makes possible the testing of ideas and hypotheses. The exposed Gawler craton and surface and drill core samples from Mt. Painter have supplied materials for further study. Plate tectonic reconstructions of the Gawler craton make it possible to apply Olympic Dam genetic models to other continents. The present study undertakes this application to the United States resulting in several areas being interesting targets.

Hitherto, only limited research has been undertaken on how Muslim astronauts can maintain their Islam for a prolonged period away from the Earth. This paper will commence with an introduction to Islamic law (which includes the distinct term fiqh), before discussing the obligations of Muslims in space. Also discussed in this paper will be the Maqasid, or higher objectives, which provides an avenue for Muslim space travelers to maintain their Islam within the framework of the religion. The methodology used in this paper is based on research of existing literature, comments from previous Muslim astronauts as well as a review of Muslim law that pertains to travel. The finding of this paper sets out the application of Islamic Law for interstellar Space Travel and off-world colonisation. It discusses the relevant ibadah rulings (literally meaning religious rituals such as prayer, fasting, ablution, keeping halal, and death rites inter alia) and how these can be practically applied in the context of space travel. This paper also outlines the moral, legal and practical challenges faced by a Muslim undertaking Space Travel and discusses the relevant Islamic ‘knowledge’ that may assist in reconciling these issues. The term interstellar Space Travel and colonisation is used to refer to those activities that are performed away from the Earth, such as in the micro-gravity of space or on an off world colony i.e., Mars. This paper is unique from other published papers in the field as it contemplates off world habitation and not just a short-term sojourn into space. The research finding is that Islamic Law is able to adapt to the challenges of space by incorporating how early Muslims maintained their Islam while traveling long distances outside their home countries. This is an emerging area of study, so there is a dearth and scarcity of literature about Muslims in space written from a scholarly perspective. This paper intends to rectify this situation by providing a marker for other scholars and researchers to follow",https://jurnal.iain-padangsidimpuan.ac.id/index.php/F/article/download/7655/4711,

The new paradigm of plate tectonics began in 1960 with Harry H. Hess's 1960 realization that new ocean floor was being created today and is not everywhere of Precambrian age as previously thought. In the following decades an unprecedented coming together of bathymetric, topographic, magnetic, gravity, seismicity, seismic profiling data occurred, all supporting and building upon the concept of plate tectonics. Most investigators accepted the premise that there was no net torque amongst the plates. Bowin (2010) demonstrated that plates accelerated and decelerated at rates 10−8 times smaller than plate velocities, and that globally angular momentum is conserved by plate tectonic motions, but few appeared to note its existence. Here we first summarize how we separate where different mass sources may lie within the Earth and how we can estimate their mass. The Earth's greatest mass anomalies arise from topography of the boundary between the metallic nickel–iron core and the silicate mantle that dominate the Earth's spherical harmonic degree 2 and 3 potential field coefficients, and overwhelm all other internal mass anomalies. The mass anomalies due to phase changes in olivine and pyroxene in subducted lithosphere are hidden within the spherical harmonic degree 4–10 packet, and are an order of magnitude smaller than those from the core–mantle boundary. Then we explore the geometry of the Emperor and Hawaiian seamount chains and the 60° bend between them that aids in documenting the slow acceleration during both the Pacific Plate's northward motion that formed the Emperor seamount chain and its westward motion that formed the Hawaiian seamount chain, but it decelerated at the time of the bend (46 Myr). Although the 60° change in direction of the Pacific Plate at of the bend, there appears to have been nary a pause in a passive spreading history for the North Atlantic Plate, for example. This, too, supports phase change being the single driver for plate tectonics and conservation of angular momentum. Since mountain building we now know results from changes in momentum, we have calculated an experimental deformation index value (1–1000) based on a world topographic grid at 5 arcmin spacing and displayed those results for viewing.",https://se.copernicus.org/articles/6/1075/2015/se-6-1075-2015.pdf,

Both Soviet and U.S. scientists were forced to speculate about how objects would perform above the atmosphere without knowing what would truly happen. TIROS I, for example, was the first successful orbit-sustaining satellite, designed to map the earth's weather. It was launched by the United States' National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) on 1 April I960.1 Thirty years later, NASA turned the TIROS technology around and started looking outward, towards deep space. In 1990, NASA launched the Hubble Space Telescope into orbit and created some of the most detailed visible-light images ever, thereby allowing a deep view into space and time. Many Hubble observations have led to significant breakthroughs in astrophysics. By taking modem theory from communications satellites and looking outward instead of toward Earth, or ""reversing the lens,"" scientists were able to discover a new universe. But could scientists have accurately predicted the Internet, a rover on Mars, or hypersonic travel in the 1950s?In the field of political science, there is often a similar practice of taking previous observations and using them to try to build pictures of what world governments will look like in the future. Evidence would show, however, that there is a lack of current consensus among academics on what the world order will look like over the next fifty years. Will it finally be the end of Charles Krauthammer's ""Unipolar Moment""2 for the United States, as the world transitions to Giovanni Grevi's ""Interpolar world""?3 Or will the world develop an equilibrium solution to the ""political trilemma"" between global democracy, national determination, and economic globalization proposed by Harvard professor Dani Rodrik?4 Perhaps it could develop into a ""G-Zero"" world, as proposed by Ian Bremmer, where every state fends for itself?5 Additionally, what of the possibility that the U.S. might face a steady relative decline, while the remaining states experience Fareed Zakaria's ""Rise of the Rest""?6 Particular difficulties arrive when trying to analyze the end of the Cold War, the rapid rise of Brazil, India, China, and South Africa (BRICS), the formation of the European Union, and the deep entrenchment of the global war on terror. With so many chaotic events, political scientists are left striving to paint a coherent picture that accurately predicts the future state of the world.Sometimes, when scientists are left without a feasible theoretical basis for understanding effects in play, they look to other fields of study to identify an applicable method that might help them toward new discoveries in their own field. In the late 1980s, an air power theorist named Colonel John Warden developed an ""Air Theory for the Twenty-first Century.""7 This common-sense theory provided a ""Five-Rings Model"" lens through which strategic-level planners could examine a state and determine how best to go about dismantling a regime using the tool of military intervention. The theory breaks a state down into five basic centers of gravity (a concept proposed in the 1820s by the German military theorist Carl von Clausewitz), which military forces can then attack to impose strategic paralysis on an enemy. ""Reversing the lens"" of this theory, we can use the Five-Rings Model to examine how to build up (instead of surgically destroy) a state. However, the modem state is influenced by a factor that is much more prevalent now than in the late 1980s, when Warden developed his theory: globalization. Adding a sixth ring of globalization to the model adds another dimension to the lens with which we can examine the state. To completely understand the effects of this theory on the construct of global governance, we must first examine in more detail the Six Rings, which are Leadership, System Essentials, Infrastructure, Population, Fielded Military Forces, and Globalization. …",https://doi.org/10.11610/connections.12.3.04,
