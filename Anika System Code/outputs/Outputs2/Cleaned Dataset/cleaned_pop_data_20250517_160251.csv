Based on the LPJ‐Dynamic Global Vegetation Model, LPJmL simulates the transient changes in carbon and water cycles due to land use, the specific phenology and seasonal CO2 fluxes of agricultural‐dominated areas, and the production of crops and grazing land. It uses 13 CFTs (11 arable crops and two managed grass types), with specific parameterizations of phenology connected to leaf area development. Carbon is allocated daily towards four carbon pools, one being the yield‐bearing storage organs. Management (irrigation, treatment of residues, intercropping) can be considered in order to capture their effect on productivity, on soil organic carbon and on carbon extracted from the ecosystem. For transient simulations for the 20th century, a global historical land use data set was developed, providing the annual cover fraction of the 13 CFTs, rain‐fed and/or irrigated, within 0.5° grid cells for the period 1901–2000, using published data on land use, crop distributions and irrigated areas. Several key results are compared with observations. The simulated spatial distribution of sowing dates for temperate cereals is comparable with the reported crop calendars. The simulated seasonal canopy development agrees better with satellite observations when actual cropland distribution is taken into account. Simulated yields for temperate cereals and maize compare well with FAO statistics. Monthly carbon fluxes measured at three agricultural sites also compare well with simulations. Global simulations indicate a ∼24% (respectively ∼10%) reduction in global vegetation (respectively soil) carbon due to agriculture, and 6–9 Pg C of yearly harvested biomass in the 1990s. In contrast to simulations of the potential natural vegetation showing the land biosphere to be an increasing carbon sink during the 20th century, LPJmL simulates a net carbon source until the 1970s (due to land use), and a small sink (mostly due to changing climate and CO2) after 1970. This is comparable with earlier LPJ simulations using a more simple land use scheme, and within the uncertainty range of estimates in the 1980s and 1990s. The fluxes attributed to land use change compare well with Houghton's estimates on the land use related fluxes until the 1970s, but then they begin to diverge, probably due to the different rates of deforestation considered. The simulated impacts of agriculture on the global water cycle for the 1990s are∼5% (respectively∼20%) reduction in transpiration (respectively interception), and∼44% increase in evaporation. Global runoff, which includes a simple irrigation scheme, is practically not affected.",https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01757164/file/Bondeau2007.pdf,

The crop contributes about 20 % of the total dietary calories and proteins worldwide. Food demand in the developing regions is growing by 1 % annually and varies from 170 kg in Central Asia to 27 kg in East and South Africa. The developing regions (including China and Central Asia) account for roughly 53 % of the total harvested area and 50 % of the production. Unprecedented productivity growth from the Green Revolution (GR) since the 1960s dramatically transformed world wheat production, benefitting both producers and consumers through low production costs and low food prices. Modern wheat varieties were adopted more rapidly than any other technological innovation in the history of agriculture, recently reaching about 90 % of the area in developing regions. One of the key challenges today is to replace these varieties with new ones for better sustainability. While the GR “spared” essential ecosystems from conversion to agriculture, it also generated its own environmental problems. Also productivity increase is now slow or static. Achieving the productivity gains needed to ensure food security will therefore require more than a repeat performance of the GR of the past. Future demand will need to be achieved through sustainable intensification that combines better crop resistance to diseases and pests, adaptation to warmer climates, and reduced use of water, fertilizer, labor and fuel. Meeting these challenges will require concerted efforts in research and innovation to develop and deploy viable solutions. Substantive investment will be required to realize sustainable productivity growth through better technologies and policy and institutional innovations that facilitate farmer adoption and adaptation. The enduring lessons from the GR and the recent efforts for sustainable intensification of cereal systems in South Asia and other regions provide useful insights for the future.",https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s12571-013-0263-y.pdf,

Accumulating evidence shows that mental ill-health and poverty tend to be traveling partners, but which is the cause? Ridley et al. reviewed the literature on natural and controlled economic experiments involving individuals living in poverty. The authors sought to resolve the mechanisms whereby poverty triggers mental illness and how mental illness compounds poverty. Their results reveal the benefits of cash support and of low-cost therapeutic interventions for those suffering from mental illness under poverty. Science, this issue p. eaay0214 BACKGROUND Depression and anxiety disorders are together responsible for 8% of years lived with disability globally. Contrary to widely held preconceptions, these are not diseases of affluence. Within a given location, those with the lowest incomes are typically 1.5 to 3 times more likely than the rich to experience depression or anxiety. ADVANCES Recent research has established a bidirectional causal relationship between poverty and mental illness. Researchers have begun to isolate the underlying mechanisms, which can guide effective policies to protect the mental health of those living in poverty. We now know that loss of income causes mental illness. Negative income shocks, such as bad harvests due to poor rainfall or job losses due to factory closures, worsen mental health. Conversely, cash transfers and broader antipoverty programs reduce depression and anxiety in randomized trials. Multiple mechanisms mediate this causal chain. Poverty is associated with volatile income and expenditures. The resulting worries and uncertainty can worsen mental health. Providing health, employment, or weather insurance, or other ways of smoothing shocks, may thus lower depression and anxiety. Living in inadequate housing in low-income neighborhoods, the poor are also more exposed to environmental stresses such as pollution, temperature extremes, and challenging sleep environments, which can cause mental illness. Early-life conditions—poverty experienced in childhood and in utero—increase the likelihood of poor nutrition and other stressors, resulting in impaired cognitive development and adult mental illness. This makes a strong case for providing financial support to pregnant women and caregivers of young children. Poverty is also associated with worse physical health; greater exposure to trauma, violence, and crime; and lower social status, each of which may affect mental health. Mental illness in turn worsens economic outcomes for individuals. Studies show that randomized interventions to treat mental illnesses increase days worked. Depression and anxiety directly affect the way people think, by capturing their attention and distorting their memory. Such effects are likely to influence economic preferences and beliefs and thus distort important economic decisions made by individuals, such as how much to work, invest, and consume. Reduced concentration and greater fatigue reduce work productivity, and the social stigma of mental illness may further worsen labor-market outcomes. Mental illness appears to increase the likelihood of catastrophic health expenditures for individuals through its comorbidity with chronic illnesses such as diabetes and heart disease. Mental illness may also hinder education and skill acquisition among youth and exacerbate gender inequalities through its disproportionate prevalence among women. Parental mental illness can also influence children’s cognitive development and educational attainment, transmitting mental illness and poverty across generations. OUTLOOK The burden of mental illness is likely to increase in the coming decades. Although richer individuals within a given location are less likely to be mentally ill, richer countries do not have lower rates of mental illness. Thus, aggregate economic growth alone is unlikely to reduce mental illness. Climate change is likely to worsen mental health, both directly through the effect of higher temperatures on mood and through reductions in agricultural yields because of changes in rainfall and water supply, more frequent weather-related disasters, and an increased likelihood of violent conflict. Technological change and globalization create large overall economic gains but also concentrated groups of losers whose mental health may be compromised. The spread of social media and associated technologies may also be harming mental health, especially among adolescents. Policy action on mental health is vital, as is interdisciplinary research on the mechanisms that link poverty and mental illness. Recently developed approaches to psychotherapy, delivered through nonspecialist providers, provide a scalable and effective approach to improving mental health in low-income countries. Given the associated economic benefits of improved mental health, such interventions should be a part of the antipoverty toolkit alongside more traditional economic interventions. Understanding the most effective combination of economic and psychological support in different populations is an important next step. A priority for research is testing for a mental health–based “poverty trap.”If such poverty traps exist, then powerful one-time interventions will have large long-run effects as gains in mental health and economic outcomes reinforce one another. Evaluations of economic interventions should routinely measure mental health, and long-run evaluations of mental health interventions should measure potential impacts on poverty and other key economic outcomes. The causal relationship between poverty and mental health is even more pertinent given the ongoing pandemic, which has disproportionately affected the poor and may have lasting impacts on their economic and mental well-being. A massive investment in mental health was already long overdue. It has now become critically urgent. The causal relationship between poverty and common mental illnesses. This schematic shows the principal mechanisms we identify, on the basis of theory and empirical evidence, through which poverty and depressive and anxiety disorders interact. Why are people who live in poverty disproportionately affected by mental illness? We review the interdisciplinary evidence of the bidirectional causal relationship between poverty and common mental illnesses—depression and anxiety—and the underlying mechanisms. Research shows that mental illness reduces employment and therefore income, and that psychological interventions generate economic gains. Similarly, negative economic shocks cause mental illness, and antipoverty programs such as cash transfers improve mental health. A crucial step toward the design of effective policies is to better understand the mechanisms underlying these causal effects.",https://pure.uva.nl/ws/files/74206488/eLetter.pdf,

Improving our understanding of their impacts on crop yields is crucial to enhance the resilience of the global food system. This study analyses, to our knowledge for the first time, the impacts of climate extremes on yield anomalies of maize, soybeans, rice and spring wheat at the global scale using sub-national yield data and applying a machine-learning algorithm. We find that growing season climate factors—including mean climate as well as climate extremes—explain 20%–49% of the variance of yield anomalies (the range describes the differences between crop types), with 18%–43% of the explained variance attributable to climate extremes, depending on crop type. Temperature-related extremes show a stronger association with yield anomalies than precipitation-related factors, while irrigation partly mitigates negative effects of high temperature extremes. We developed a composite indicator to identify hotspot regions that are critical for global production and particularly susceptible to the effects of climate extremes. These regions include North America for maize, spring wheat and soy production, Asia in the case of maize and rice production as well as Europe for spring wheat production. Our study highlights the importance of considering climate extremes for agricultural predictions and adaptation planning and provides an overview of critical regions that are most susceptible to variations in growing season climate and climate extremes.",https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ab154b/pdf,

Human land use activities have resulted in large changes to the biogeochemical and biophysical properties of the Earth's surface, with consequences for climate and other ecosystem services. In the future, land use activities are likely to expand and/or intensify further to meet growing demands for food, fiber, and energy. As part of the World Climate Research Program Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6), the international community has developed the next generation of advanced Earth system models (ESMs) to estimate the combined effects of human activities (e.g., land use and fossil fuel emissions) on the carbon–climate system. A new set of historical data based on the History of the Global Environment database (HYDE), and multiple alternative scenarios of the future (2015–2100) from Integrated Assessment Model (IAM) teams, is required as input for these models. With most ESM simulations for CMIP6 now completed, it is important to document the land use patterns used by those simulations. Here we present results from the Land-Use Harmonization 2 (LUH2) project, which smoothly connects updated historical reconstructions of land use with eight new future projections in the format required for ESMs. The harmonization strategy estimates the fractional land use patterns, underlying land use transitions, key agricultural management information, and resulting secondary lands annually, while minimizing the differences between the end of the historical reconstruction and IAM initial conditions and preserving changes depicted by the IAMs in the future. The new approach builds on a similar effort from CMIP5 and is now provided at higher resolution (0.25∘×0.25∘) over a longer time domain (850–2100, with extensions to 2300) with more detail (including multiple crop and pasture types and associated management practices) using more input datasets (including Landsat remote sensing data) and updated algorithms (wood harvest and shifting cultivation); it is assessed via a new diagnostic package.

Carbon sequestration in grasslands can be determined directly by measuring changes in soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks and indirectly by measuring the net balance of C fluxes. A literature search shows that grassland C sequestration reaches on average 5 ± 30 g C/m2 per year according to inventories of SOC stocks and -231 and 77 g C/m2 per year for drained organic and mineral soils, respectively, according to C flux balance. Off-site C sequestration occurs whenever more manure C is produced by than returned to a grassland plot. The sum of on- and off-site C sequestration reaches 129, 98 and 71 g C/m2 per year for grazed, cut and mixed European grasslands on mineral soils, respectively, however with high uncertainty. A range of management practices reduce C losses and increase C sequestration: (i) avoiding soil tillage and the conversion of grasslands to arable use, (ii) moderately intensifying nutrient-poor permanent grasslands, (iii) using light grazing instead of heavy grazing, (iv) increasing the duration of grass leys; (v) converting grass leys to grass-legume mixtures or to permanent grasslands. With nine European sites, direct emissions of N2O from soil and of CH4 from enteric fermentation at grazing, expressed in CO2 equivalents, compensated 10% and 34% of the on-site grassland C sequestration, respectively. Digestion inside the barn of the harvested herbage leads to further emissions of CH4 and N2O by the production systems, which were estimated at 130 g CO2 equivalents/m2 per year. The net balance of on- and off-site C sequestration, CH4 and N2O emissions reached 38 g CO2 equivalents/m2 per year, indicating a non-significant net sink activity. This net balance was, however, negative for intensively managed cut sites indicating a source to the atmosphere. In conclusion, this review confirms that grassland C sequestration has a strong potential to partly mitigate the GHG balance of ruminant production systems. However, as soil C sequestration is both reversible and vulnerable to disturbance, biodiversity loss and climate change, CH4 and N2O emissions from the livestock sector need to be reduced and current SOC stocks preserved.",https://doi.org/10.1017/s1751731109990784,

This paper reviews the impacts of climate change on fourteen strategic crops for eight sub-Saharan Africa countries. Climate change is projected to increase median temperature by 1.4–5.5°C and median precipitation by −2% to 20% by the end of the 21st century. However, large levels of uncertainty exist with temporal and spatial variability of rainfall events. The impact of climate change on crop yields in the region is largely negative. Among the grain crops, wheat is reported as the most vulnerable crop, for which up to 72% of the current yield is projected to decline. For other grain crops, such as maize, rice and soybean, up to 45% yield reductions are expected by the end of this century. Two grain crops, millet and sorghum, are more resilient to climate change for which projected impacts on crop yields are <20%. Root crops, such as sweet potato, potato and cassava are projected to be less affected than the grain crops with changes to crop yields ranging from about −15% to 10%. For the two major export crops, tea and coffee, up to 40% yield loss is expected due to the reduction in suitable areas caused by temperature increase. Similar loss of suitable areas is also expected for banana and sugarcane production, however, this reduction is due to rainfall variability in lowland areas. Other crops such as cotton and sugarcane are projected to be more susceptible to precipitation variation that will vary significantly in the region. In order to mitigate the long-term impacts of climate change on agricultural sectors, the development of small-scale irrigation systems and water harvesting structures seems promising, however, affordability of such measures remains a key issue.",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1002/fes3.61,

This is also true for agricultural regions, where exposure to extreme heat, particularly during key growth phases such as the reproductive period, can severely damage crop production in ways that are not captured by most crop models. Here, we analyze exposure of crops to physiologically critical temperatures in the reproductive stage (Tcrit), across the global harvested areas of maize, rice, soybean and wheat. Trends for the 1980–2011 period show a relatively weak correspondence (r = 0.19) between mean growing season temperature and Tcrit exposure trends, emphasizing the importance of separate analyses for Tcrit. Increasing Tcrit exposure in the past few decades is apparent for wheat in Central and South Asia and South America, and for maize in many diverse locations across the globe. Maize had the highest percentage (15%) of global harvested area exposed to at least five reproductive days over Tcrit in the 2000s, although this value is somewhat sensitive to the exact temperature used for the threshold. While there was relatively little sustained exposure to reproductive days over Tcrit for the other crops in the past few decades, all show increases with future warming. Using projections from climate models we estimate that by the 2030s, 31, 16, and 11% respectively of maize, rice, and wheat global harvested area will be exposed to at least five reproductive days over Tcrit in a typical year, with soybean much less affected. Both maize and rice exhibit non-linear increases with time, with total area exposed for rice projected to grow from 8% in the 2000s to 27% by the 2050s, and maize from 15 to 44% over the same period. While faster development should lead to earlier flowering, which would reduce reproductive extreme heat exposure for wheat on a global basis, this would have little impact for the other crops. Therefore, regardless of the impact of other global change factors (such as increasing atmospheric CO2), reproductive extreme heat exposure will pose risks for global crop production without adaptive measures such as changes in sowing dates, crop and variety switching, expansion of irrigation, and agricultural expansion into cooler areas.",https://doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/8/2/024041,

Current research efforts have identified NUCS as having potential to reduce food and nutrition insecurity, particularly for resource poor households in SSA. This is because of their adaptability to low input agricultural systems and nutritional composition. However, what is required to promote NUCS is scientific research including agronomy, breeding, post-harvest handling and value addition, and linking farmers to markets. Among the essential knowledge base is reliable information about water utilisation by NUCS with potential for commercialisation. This commentary identifies and characterises NUCS with agronomic potential in SSA, especially in the semi-arid areas taking into consideration inter alia: (i) what can grow under water-scarce conditions, (ii) water requirements, and (iii) water productivity. Several representative leafy vegetables, tuber crops, cereal crops and grain legumes were identified as fitting the NUCS category.

In this contribution we present a whole-systems analysis of the BECCS value chain associated with cultivation, harvesting, transport and conversion in dedicated biomass power stations in conjunction with CCS, of a range of biomass resources – both dedicated energy crops (miscanthus, switchgrass, short rotation coppice willow), and agricultural residues (wheat straw). We explicitly consider the implications of sourcing the biomass from different regions, climates and land types. The water, carbon and energy footprints of each value chain were calculated, and their impact on the overall system water, carbon and power efficiencies was evaluated. An extensive literature review was performed and a statistical analysis of the available data is presented. In order to describe the dynamic greenhouse gas balance of such a system, a yearly accounting of the emissions was performed over the lifetime of a BECCS facility, and the carbon “breakeven time” and lifetime net CO2 removal from the atmosphere were determined. The effects of direct and indirect land use change were included, and were found to be a key determinant of the viability of a BECCS project. Overall we conclude that, depending on the conditions of its deployment, BECCS could lead to both carbon positive and negative results. The total quantity of CO2 removed from the atmosphere over the project lifetime and the carbon breakeven time were observed to be highly case specific. This has profound implications for the policy frameworks required to incentivise and regulate the widespread deployment of BECCS technology. The results of a sensitivity analysis on the model combined with the investigation of alternate supply chain scenarios elucidated key levers to improve the sustainability of BECCS: (1) measuring and limiting the impacts of direct and indirect land use change, (2) using carbon neutral power and organic fertilizer, (3) minimising biomass transport, and prioritising sea over road transport, (4) maximising the use of carbon negative fuels, and (5) exploiting alternative biomass processing options, e.g., natural drying or torrefaction. A key conclusion is that, regardless of the biomass and region studied, the sustainability of BECCS relies heavily on intelligent management of the supply chain.",https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlepdf/2017/ee/c7ee00465f,

In sub-Saharan Africa, the number of people suffering from hunger is estimated at 239 million, and this figure could increase in the near future.There are many examples of food insecurity in sub-Saharan Africa, some of them having reached catastrophic dimensions, for example, in the Horn of Africa or southern Madagascar. Food insecurity is not just about insufficient food production, availability, and intake, it is also about the poor quality or nutritional value of the food. The detrimental situation of women and children is particularly serious, as well as the situation among female teenagers, who receive less food than their male counterparts in the same households.Soaring food prices and food riots are among the many symptoms of the prevailing food crisis and insecurity. Climate change and weather vagaries, present and forecast, are generally compounding food insecurity and drastically changing farming activities, as diagnosed by the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR) in June 2011.The key cause of food insecurity is inadequate food production. Since the global food crisis of 2007–2008, there has been an increasing awareness throughout the world that we must produce more and better food; and we should not be derailed from this goal, despite some relief brought by the good cereal harvests in 2011–2012. This is particularly true in sub-Saharan Africa, which needs and wants to make its own green revolution.The African challenge indeed is key to mitigating food insecurity in the world. Commitments were made by the heads of states and governments of the African Union to double the part of their domestic budgets devoted to agriculture in 2010–2011, so as to reach 10%. Technical solutions exist and there are indeed, throughout Africa, good examples of higher-yielding and sustainable agriculture. But good practices have to spread throughout the continent, while at the same time social and economic measures, as well as political will, are indispensable ingredients of Africa’s green revolution. It is also necessary that international donors fulfil their commitment to help African farmers and rural communities and protect them against unfair trade, competition, and dumping of cheap agrifood products from overseas.",https://agricultureandfoodsecurity.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/2048-7010-1-2,

In each village, a sample size of 10% of all households was interviewed. Findings showed that local people perceived changes in rainfall and temperature. The changes have affected crops and livestock in a number of ways resulting in reduced productivity. Empirical analysis of rainfall suggest decreasing rainfall trend between 1922 and 2007 whereas mean maximum and minimum temperature increased by 1.9 and 0.2°C respectively. The average annual temperature increase of 0.7°C between 1984 and 2004 was realized. There are different wealth groups namely the rich, the middle and the poor and these are differently vulnerable climate change. The study concluded that, the wealth of knowledge on coping and adaptation that farmer has should form a foundation for designing agricultural innovation systems to deal with impacts of climate change and variability.

Developing countries with weak purchasing power tend to import as little food as possible from global markets, suffering consumption deficits during times of high prices or production declines. Local agricultural production, therefore, is critical to both food security and economic development among the rural poor. The level of local agricultural production, in turn, will be determined by the amount and quality of arable land, the amount and quality of agricultural inputs (fertilizer, seeds, pesticides, etc.), as well as farm-related technology, practices and policies. This paper discusses several emerging threats to global and regional food security, including declining yield gains that are failing to keep up with population increases, and warming in the tropical Indian Ocean and its impact on rainfall. If yields continue to grow more slowly than per capita harvested area, parts of Africa, Asia and Central and Southern America will experience substantial declines in per capita cereal production. Global per capita cereal production will potentially decline by 14% between 2008 and 2030. Climate change is likely to further affect food production, particularly in regions that have very low yields due to lack of technology. Drought, caused by anthropogenic warming in the Indian and Pacific Oceans, may also reduce 21st century food availability in some countries by disrupting moisture transports and bringing down dry air over crop growing areas. The impacts of these circulation changes over Asia remain uncertain. For Africa, however, Indian Ocean warming appears to have already reduced rainfall during the main growing season along the eastern edge of tropical Africa, from southern Somalia to northern parts of the Republic of South Africa. Through a combination of quantitative modeling of food balances and an examination of climate change, this study presents an analysis of emerging threats to global food security.",https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s12571-009-0026-y.pdf,

At the same time, these food production systems themselves have a range of negative impacts on the environment. In this paper we review the published literature and assess the depth of recent research (since 2000) on crop x environment interactions for rice, maize, sorghum/millets, sweetpotato/yam and cassava in these two regions. We summarize current understandings of the environmental impacts of crop production systems prior to crop production, during production and post-production, and emphasize how those initial environmental impacts become new and more severe environmental constraints to crop yields. Pre-production environmental interactions relate to agricultural expansion or intensification, and include soil degradation and erosion, the loss of wild biodiversity, loss of food crop genetic diversity and climate change. Those during crop production include soil nutrient depletion, water depletion, soil and water contamination, and pest resistance/outbreaks and the emergence of new pests and diseases. Post-harvest environmental interactions relate to the effects of crop residue disposal, as well as crop storage and processing. We find the depth of recent publications on environmental impacts is very uneven across crops and regions. Most information is available for rice in South Asia and maize in Sub-Saharan Africa where these crops are widely grown and have large environmental impacts, often relating to soil nutrient and water management. Relatively few new studies have been reported for sorghum/millets, sweetpotato/yam or cassava, despite their importance for food security on large areas of marginal farmland in Sub-Saharan Africa – however, there is mounting evidence that even these low-input crops, once thought to be environmentally benign, are contributing to cycles of environmental degradation that threaten current and future food production. A concluding overview of the emerging range of published good practices for smallholder farmers highlights many opportunities to better manage crop x environment interactions and reduce environmental impacts from these crops in developing countries.",https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s12571-015-0478-1.pdf,

The Indus Basin is shared by 4 countries – Pakistan, India, Afghanistan and China. With a current population of 237 million people which is projected to increase to 319 million in 2025 and 383 million in 2050, already today water resources are abstracted almost entirely (more than 95% for irrigation). Climate change will result in increased water availability in the short term. However in the long term water availability will decrease. Some current aspects in the basin need to be re-evaluated. During the past decades water abstractions – and especially groundwater extractions – have augmented continuously to support a rice-wheat system where rice is grown during the kharif (wet, summer) season (as well as sugar cane, cotton, maize and other crops) and wheat during the rabi (dry, winter) season. However, the sustainability of this system in its current form is questionable. Additional water for domestic and industrial purposes is required for the future and should be made available by a reduction in irrigation requirements. This paper gives a comprehensive listing and description of available options for current and future sustainable water resources management (WRM) within the basin. Sustainable WRM practices include both water supply management and water demand management options. Water supply management options include: (1) reservoir management as the basin is characterised by a strong seasonal behaviour in water availability (monsoon and meltwater) and water demands; (2) water quality conservation and investment in wastewater infrastructure; (3) the use of alternative water resources like the recycling of wastewater and desalination; (4) land use planning and soil conservation as well as flood management, with a focus on the reduction of erosion and resulting sedimentation as well as the restoration of ecosystem services like wetlands and natural floodplains. Water demand management options include: (1) the management of conjunctive use of surface and groundwater; as well as (2) the rehabilitation and modernization of existing infrastructure. Other demand management options are: (3) the increase of water productivity for agriculture; (4) crop planning and diversification including the critical assessment of agricultural export, especially (basmati) rice; (5) economic instruments and (6) changing food demand patterns and limiting post-harvest losses.",https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-16-1063-2012,

The farming systems are facing constraints such as small land size, lack of resources, and increasing degradation of soil quality that hamper sustainable crop production and food security. The effects of climate change (e.g., frequent occurrence of extreme weather events) exacerbate these problems. Applying appropriate technologies like climate-smart agriculture (CSA) can help to resolve the constraints of smallholder farming systems. This paper provides a comprehensive overview regarding opportunities and challenges of traditional and newly developed CSA practices in Ethiopia, such as integrated soil fertility management, water harvesting, and agroforestry. These practices are commonly related to drought resilience, stability of crop yields, carbon sequestration, greenhouse gas mitigation, and higher household income. However, the adoption of the practices by smallholder farmers is often limited, mainly due to shortage of cropland, land tenure issues, lack of adequate knowledge about CSA, slow return on investments, and insufficient policy and implementation schemes. It is suggested that additional measures be developed and made available to help CSA practices become more prevalent in smallholder farming systems. The measures should include the utilization of degraded and marginal lands, improvement of the soil organic matter management, provision of capacity-building opportunities and financial support, as well as the development of specific policies for smallholder farming.",https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0472/11/3/192/pdf?version=1615454550,

Many previous studies were mainly focused on the whole crop growth period through expensive manual surveys, remote sensing, or climate data. However, the effect of selecting different time window on yield prediction was still unknown. Thus, we separated the whole growth period into four time windows and assessed their corresponding predictive ability by taking the major winter wheat production regions of China as an example in the study. Firstly we developed a modeling framework to integrate climate data, remote sensing data and soil data to predict winter wheat yield based on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. The results show that the models can accurately predict yield 1~2 months before the harvesting dates at the county level in China with an R2 > 0.75 and yield error less than 10%. Support vector machine (SVM), Gaussian process regression (GPR), and random forest (RF) represent the top three best methods for predicting yields among the eight typical machine learning models tested in this study. In addition, we also found that different agricultural zones and temporal training settings affect prediction accuracy. The three models perform better as more winter wheat growing season information becomes available.

This study reviews existing and available literature on farmers’ perceptions and adaptations to climate change in sub-Sahara Africa. It is evident that the majority of farmers in sub-Sahara Africa are aware of warmer temperatures and changes in precipitation patterns. To respond to these changes, farmers have adopted crop diversification, planting different crop varieties, changing planting and harvesting dates to correspond to the changing pattern of precipitation, irrigation, planting tree crops,water and soil conservation techniques, and switching to non-farm income activities. Years of farming experience, household size, years of education, access to credit facilities, access to extension services and off-farm income are among the signicant determinants of adopting climate change adaptation measures. To enable sub-Sahara African farmers to develop more effective climate change adaptationstrategies,there is the need for African governments to support farmers by providing the necessary resources such as credit, information and extension workers to train farmers on climate change adaptation strategies and technologies, and investing in climate resilient projects like, improving on existing or building new water infrastructure and building climate change monitoring and reporting stations.",https://ccsenet.org/journal/index.php/jas/article/download/23791/15889,

Ample evidence exists that improved on-farm water management can close water-related yield gaps to a considerable degree, but its global significance remains unclear. In this modeling study we investigate systematically to what extent integrated crop water management might contribute to closing the global food gap, constrained by the assumption that pressure on water resources and land does not increase. Using a process-based bio-/agrosphere model, we simulate the yield-increasing potential of elevated irrigation water productivity (including irrigation expansion with thus saved water) and optimized use of in situ precipitation water (alleviated soil evaporation, enhanced infiltration, water harvesting for supplemental irrigation) under current and projected future climate (from 20 climate models, with and without beneficial CO2 effects). Results show that irrigation efficiency improvements can save substantial amounts of water in many river basins (globally 48% of non-productive water consumption in an ‘ambitious’ scenario), and if rerouted to irrigate neighboring rainfed systems, can boost kcal production significantly (26% global increase). Low-tech solutions for small-scale farmers on water-limited croplands show the potential to increase rainfed yields to a similar extent. In combination, the ambitious yet achievable integrated water management strategies explored in this study could increase global production by 41% and close the water-related yield gap by 62%. Unabated climate change will have adverse effects on crop yields in many regions, but improvements in water management as analyzed here can buffer such effects to a significant degree.",https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/11/2/025002/pdf,

We used four approaches at different scales to gauge the potential of UFF to enhance urban sustainability and contribute to food security in the context of urbanization and climate change. First, we identified 37 current initiatives based around urban food trees, and analyzed their activities in three categories: planting, mapping, and harvesting, finding that the majority (73 %) only performed one activity, and only 8 % performed all three. Second, we analyzed 30 urban forestry master plans, finding that only 13 % included human food security among their objectives, while 77 % included habitat for wildlife. Third, we used Burlington, Vermont as a case study to quantify the potential fruit yield of publicly accessible open space if planted with Malus domestica (the common apple) under nine different planting and yield scenarios. We found that 108 % of the daily recommended minimum intake of fruit for the entire city’s population could be met under the most ambitious planting scenario, with substantial potential to contribute to food security even under more modest scenarios. Finally, we developed a Climate–Food–Species Matrix of potential food trees appropriate for temperate urban environments as a decision-making tool. We identified a total of 70 species, 30 of which we deemed “highly suitable” for urban food forestry based on their cold hardiness, drought tolerance, and edibility.

Average rates of photosynthesis and stomatal conductance are closely correlated and operate near 50% of their maximal rate, with light being the limiting factor in humid regions and air humidity and soil water the limiting factor in arid climates. Leaf area is the main factor to extrapolate from leaves to canopies, with maximum surface conductance being dependent on leaf level stomatal conductance. Additionally, gas exchange depends also on rooting depth which determines the water and nutrient availability and on mycorrhizae which regulate the nutrient status. An important anthropogenic disturbance is the nitrogen uptake from air pollutants, which is not balanced by cation uptake from roots and this may lead to damage and breakdown of the plant cover. Photosynthesis is the main carbon input into ecosystems, but it alone does not represent the ecosystem carbon balance, which is determined by respiration of various kinds. Plant respiration and photosynthesis determine growth (net primary production) and microbial respiration balances the net ecosystem flux. In a spruce forest, 30% of the assimilatory carbon gain is used for respiration of needles, 20% is used for respiration in stems. Soil respiration is about 50% the carbon gain, half of which is root respiration, half is microbial respiration. In addition, disturbances lead to carbon losses, where fire, harvest and grazing bypass the chain of respiration. In total, the carbon balance at the biome level is only about 1% of the photosynthetic carbon input, or may indeed become negative. The recent observed increase in plant growth has different reasons depending on the region of the world: anthropogenic nitrogen deposition is the controlling factor in Europe, increasing global temperatures is the main factor in Siberia, and maybe rising CO2 the factor controlling the carbon fluxes in Amazonia. However, this has not lead to increases in net biome productivity, due to associated losses. Also important is the interaction between biodiversity and biogeochemical processes. It is shown that net primary productivity increases with plant species diversity (50% species loss equals 20% loss in productivity). However, in this extrapolation the action of soil biota is poorly understood although soils contribute the largest number of species and of taxonomic groups to an ecosystem. The global terrestrial carbon budget strongly depends on areas with pristine old growth forests which are carbon sinks. The management options are very limited, mostly short term, and usually associated with high uncertainty. Unmanaged grasslands appear to be a carbon sink of similar magnitude as forest, but generally these ecosystems lost their C with grazing and agricultural use. Extrapolation to the future of Earth climate shows that the biota will not be able to balance fossil fuel emissions, and that it will be essential to develop a carbon free energy system in order to maintain the living conditions on earth.",https://bg.copernicus.org/articles/3/147/2006/bg-3-147-2006.pdf,

However, historical impacts on European crop production associated with droughts, heatwaves, floods, and cold waves are not well understood—especially in view of potential adverse trends in the severity of impacts due to climate change. Here, we combine observational agricultural data (FAOSTAT) with an extreme weather disaster database (EM-DAT) between 1961 and 2018 to evaluate European crop production responses to EWD. Using a compositing approach (superposed epoch analysis), we show that historical droughts and heatwaves reduced European cereal yields on average by 9% and 7.3%, respectively, associated with a wide range of responses (inter-quartile range +2% to −23%; +2% to −17%). Non-cereal yields declined by 3.8% and 3.1% during the same set of events. Cold waves led to cereal and non-cereal yield declines by 1.3% and 2.6%, while flood impacts were marginal and not statistically significant. Production losses are largely driven by yield declines, with no significant changes in harvested area. While all four event frequencies significantly increased over time, the severity of heatwave and drought impacts on crop production roughly tripled over the last 50 years, from −2.2% (1964–1990) to −7.3% (1991–2015). Drought-related cereal production losses are shown to intensify by more than 3% yr−1. Both the trend in frequency and severity can possibly be explained by changes in the vulnerability of the exposed system and underlying climate change impacts.",https://doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/abf004,

Their durations and intensities increase, and their seasonal timing alters with changing climate. During the ontogenic cycle of crop plants, each development stage, such as seed germination, seedling establishment, vegetative root and shoot growth, flowering, pollination and seed and fruit development, is specifically sensitive to dehydration. Desiccation threatens yield and leads to specific patterns, depending on the type of crop plant and the harvested plant parts, e.g. leafy vegetables, tubers, tap roots or fruits. This review summarizes the effects of drought stress on crop plants and relates the dehydration-dependent yield penalty to the harvested organ and tissue. The control of shoot transpiration and the reorganization of root architecture are of core importance for maintaining proper plant water relationships. Upon dehydration, the provision and partitioning of assimilates and the uptake and distribution of nutrients define remaining growth activity. Domestication of crops by selection for high yield under high input has restricted the genetic repertoire for achieving drought stress tolerance. Introgression of suitable alleles from wild relatives into commercial cultivars might improve the ability to grow with less water. Future research activities should focus more on field studies in order to generate more realistic improvements to crops. Robotic field phenotyping should be integrated into genetic mapping for the identification of relevant traits.",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1111/plb.13304,

Brazil is the third largest fruit producer, with output of around 40 million tons a year, but has only 2% of global trade industry, which demonstrates the high domestic consumption. The Brazilian fruit growing area is approximately 1.9 million hectares of which 1,034,708 hectares of tropical fruits, 928,552 ha of subtropical fruits and 135,857 ha of temperate species. Among the fruits of temperate climate, are table and wine grapes (81,677 ha), apples (39,081 ha), peaches, plums and nectarines (19,102 ha), persimmons (8,740 ha), strawberries, blackberries, raspberries , blueberries (3,560 ha), figs (3,072 ha), pears (1,404 ha) and quinces (211 ha). Even with a smaller area than the species of tropical and subtropical climate, the temperate fruits have a social importance, highlighted in several regions of southern Brazil, which corresponds to the states of Rio Grande do Sul, Santa Catarina, Parana, of southeastern Brazil, Sao Paulo and Minas Gerais, and in the Sao Francisco Valley region, in northeasten Brazil, either as fresh crops, agribusiness and/or agrotourism. Brazilian exports of fruits in recent years have been very positive, both in volume and in value. In 1998 Brazil exported 294,222 tons of fruits, whereas in 2008 exported 887,978 tons, representing a 201.8% increase in export volume. The main fruits that contributed to this significant increase were melon, mango, banana, apple and grape, with an increase in export volume between 1998 and 2008 of 226, 242, 91, 948 and 1766% respectively. The production of quality fruits in the temperate regions of southeastern Brazil needs genetic and breeding programs and studies on agricultural management, as well as on plant physiology to adapt them to the mild winter and to the range of temperatures, very frequent in major Brazilian regions. The long summers and precipitation excess cause many diseases and pests, which often requires pesticide treatments in excess. The management of the orchards with integrated fruit production is enabling the production of high quality fruits and at the same time is reducing the environmental impact of the activity. The challenges are related to climate changes, the necessity of pesticide use reduction and supplies, the fruit handling pre-and post-harvest, and to the need for logistics to suit the different markets, the control of pests and diseases and the breeding programs, in order to meet the new demands of each temperate species.",https://www.scielo.br/j/rbf/a/SXWHsCGHCt3dmrYpHzTd3Sk/?lang=pt&format=pdf,

This has provided an opportunity to estimate how a management alternative impacts greenhouse gas emissions at a large regional scale. We integrated a process‐based model, DNDC, with a GIS database of paddy area, soil properties, and management factors. We simulated soil carbon sequestration (or net CO2 emission) and CH4 and N2O emissions from China's rice paddies (30 million ha), based on 1990 climate and management conditions, with two water management scenarios: continuous flooding and midseason drainage. The results indicated that this change in water management has reduced aggregate CH4 emissions about 40%, or 5 Tg CH4 yr−1, roughly 5–10% of total global methane emissions from rice paddies. The mitigating effect of midseason drainage on CH4 flux was highly uneven across the country; the highest flux reductions (>200 kg CH4‐C ha−1 yr−1) were in Hainan, Sichuan, Hubei, and Guangdong provinces, with warmer weather and multiple‐cropping rice systems. The smallest flux reductions (<25 kg CH4‐C ha−1 yr−1) occurred in Tianjin, Hebei, Ningxia, Liaoning, and Gansu Provinces, with relatively cool weather and single cropping systems. Shifting water management from continuous flooding to midseason drainage increased N2O emissions from Chinese rice paddies by 0.15 Tg N yr−1 (∼50% increase). This offset a large fraction of the greenhouse gas radiative forcing benefit gained by the decrease in CH4 emissions. Midseason drainage‐induced N2O fluxes were high (>8.0 kg N/ha) in Jilin, Liaoning, Heilongjiang, and Xinjiang provinces, where the paddy soils contained relatively high organic matter. Shifting water management from continuous flooding to midseason drainage reduced total net CO2 emissions by 0.65 Tg CO2‐C yr−1, which made a relatively small contribution to the net climate impact due to the low radiative potential of CO2. The change in water management had very different effects on net greenhouse gas mitigation when implemented across climatic zones, soil types, or cropping systems. Maximum CH4 reductions and minimum N2O increases were obtained when the mid‐season draining was applied to rice paddies with warm weather, high soil clay content, and low soil organic matter content, for example, Sichuan, Hubei, Hunan, Guangdong, Guangxi, Anhui, and Jiangsu provinces, which have 60% of China's rice paddies and produce 65% of China's rice harvest.",http://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/2027.42/134297/2/ecs21459.pdf,

Fresh vegetables are an integral part of a healthy diet, providing vitamins, minerals, antioxidants and other health‐promoting compounds. The diversity of fresh vegetables and packaging formats (spring mix in clamshell container, bagged heads of lettuce) support increased consumption. Unfortunately, vegetable production and processing practices are not sufficient to ensure complete microbial safety. This review highlights a few specific areas that require greater attention and research. Selected outbreaks are presented to emphasize the need for science‐based ‘best practices’. Laboratory and field studies have focused on inactivation of pathogens associated with manure in liquid, slurry or solid forms. As production practices change, other forms and types of soil amendments are being used more prevalently. Information regarding the microbial safety of fish emulsion and pellet form of manure is limited. The topic of global climate change is controversial, but the potential effect on agriculture cannot be ignored. Changes in temperature, precipitation, humidity and wind can impact crops and the microorganisms that are associated with production environments. Climate change could potentially enhance the ability of pathogens to survive and persist in soil, water and crops, increasing human health risks. Limited research has focused on the prevalence and behaviour of viruses in pre and post‐harvest environments and on vegetable commodities. Globally, viruses are a major cause of foodborne illnesses, but are seldom tested for in soil, soil amendments, manure and crops. Greater attention must also be given to the improvement in the microbial quality of seeds used in sprout production. Human pathogens associated with seeds can result in contamination of sprouts intended for human consumption, even when all appropriate ‘best practices’ are used by sprout growers.",https://europepmc.org/articles/pmc4265071?pdf=render,

A moderate scenario, implying both a 25% reduction in evaporation and a 25% collection of runoff, suggests that global crop production can be increased by 19%, which is comparable with the effect of current irrigation (17%). Climate change alone (three climate models, SRES A2r emissions and population, constant land use) will reduce global crop production by 9% by 2050, which could be buffered by a vapor shift level of 50% or a water harvesting level of 25%.

Recent climate change models predict severe losses in crop production worldwide due to the changing environment, and in wheat, this can be as large as 42 Mt/°C rise in temperature. Although wheat occupies the largest total harvested area (38.8%) among the cereals including rice and maize, its total productivity remains the lowest. The major production losses in wheat are caused more by abiotic stresses such as drought, salinity, and high temperature than by biotic insults. Thus, understanding the effects of these stresses becomes indispensable for wheat improvement programs which have depended mainly on the genetic variations present in the wheat genome through conventional breeding. Notably, recent biotechnological breakthroughs in the understanding of gene functions and access to whole genome sequences have opened new avenues for crop improvement. Despite the availability of such resources in wheat, progress is still limited to the understanding of the stress signaling mechanisms using model plants such as Arabidopsis, rice and Brachypodium and not directly using wheat as the model organism. This review presents an inclusive overview of the phenotypic and physiological changes in wheat due to various abiotic stresses followed by the current state of knowledge on the identified mechanisms of perception and signal transduction in wheat.

Microalgal biofuels are produced using sunlight, water, and simple salt minerals. Their high growth rate, photosynthesis, and carbon dioxide sequestration capacity make them one of the most important biorefinery platforms. Furthermore, microalgae's ability to alter their metabolism in response to environmental stresses to produce relatively high levels of high-value compounds makes them a promising alternative to fossil fuels. As a result, microalgae can significantly contribute to long-term solutions to critical global issues such as the energy crisis and climate change. The environmental benefits of algal biofuel have been demonstrated by significant reductions in carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxide, and sulfur oxide emissions. Microalgae-derived biomass has the potential to generate a wide range of commercially important high-value compounds, novel materials, and feedstock for a variety of industries, including cosmetics, food, and feed. This review evaluates the potential of using microalgal biomass to produce a variety of bioenergy carriers, including biodiesel from stored lipids, alcohols from reserved carbohydrate fermentation, and hydrogen, syngas, methane, biochar and bio-oils via anaerobic digestion, pyrolysis, and gasification. Furthermore, the potential use of microalgal biomass in carbon sequestration routes as an atmospheric carbon removal approach is being evaluated. The cost of algal biofuel production is primarily determined by culturing (77%), harvesting (12%), and lipid extraction (7.9%). As a result, the choice of microalgal species and cultivation mode (autotrophic, heterotrophic, and mixotrophic) are important factors in controlling biomass and bioenergy production, as well as fuel properties. The simultaneous production of microalgal biomass in agricultural, municipal, or industrial wastewater is a low-cost option that could significantly reduce economic and environmental costs while also providing a valuable remediation service. Microalgae have also been proposed as a viable candidate for carbon dioxide capture from the atmosphere or an industrial point source. Microalgae can sequester 1.3 kg of carbon dioxide to produce 1 kg of biomass. Using potent microalgal strains in efficient design bioreactors for carbon dioxide sequestration is thus a challenge. Microalgae can theoretically use up to 9% of light energy to capture and convert 513 tons of carbon dioxide into 280 tons of dry biomass per hectare per year in open and closed cultures. Using an integrated microalgal bio-refinery to recover high-value-added products could reduce waste and create efficient biomass processing into bioenergy. To design an efficient atmospheric carbon removal system, algal biomass cultivation should be coupled with thermochemical technologies, such as pyrolysis.",https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10311-022-01458-1.pdf,

We developed a spatially explicit global dataset of historical yields for maize, soybean, rice and wheat to explore the historical changes in mean, year-to-year variation and annual rate of change in yields for the period 1982–2006. Location This study was conducted at the global scale. Methods We modelled historical and spatial patterns of yields at a grid size of 1.125° by combining global agricultural datasets related to the crop calendar and harvested area in 2000, country yield statistics and satellite-derived net primary production. Modelled yields were compared with other global datasets of yields in 2000 (M3-Crops and MapSPAM) and subnational yield statistics for 23 major crop-producing countries. Historical changes in modelled yields were then examined. Results Modelled yields explained 45–81% of the spatial variation of yields in 2000 from M3-Crops and MapSPAM, with root-mean-square errors of 0.5–1.8 t ha−1. Most correlation coefficients between modelled yield time series and subnational yield statistics for the period 1982–2006 in major crop-producing regions were greater than 0.8.

Main conclusions Our analyses revealed increased instability of yields across a broad region of the Southern Hemisphere, where many developing countries are located.

We show that if 90% of the new urban population would be housed in newly built urban mid-rise buildings with wooden constructions, 106 Gt of additional CO2 could be saved by 2100. Forest plantations would need to expand by up to 149 Mha by 2100 and harvests from unprotected natural forests would increase. Our results indicate that expansion of timber plantations for wooden buildings is possible without major repercussions on agricultural production. Strong governance and careful planning are required to ensure a sustainable transition to timber cities even if frontier forests and biodiversity hotspots are protected. Wood used in construction stores carbon and reduces the emissions from steel and cement production. Transformation to timber cities while protecting forest and biodiversity is possible without significant increase in competition for land.",https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-32244-w.pdf,

However, there is limited attention in the region to emerging initiatives, technologies and policies that are tailored to building the adaptive capacity of agricultural systems to climate change and variability. In this paper, we discuss the prospects for climate-smart agriculture technologies and enabling policies in dealing with climate change and variability at different sub-regional levels of sub-Saharan Africa to sustain farm productivity and livelihoods of agrarian communities. The review provides substantial information suggesting that without appropriate interventions, climate change and variability will affect agricultural yields, food security and add to the presently unaceptable levels of poverty in sub-Saharan Africa. Although some of them were already existing, the past decades have seen the development and promotion of climate-smart agriculture innovations such as the use of high yielding drought tolerant crop varieties, climate information services, agricultural insurance, agroforestry, water harvesting techniques, integrated soil fertility management practices, etc. In the context of climate change, this appears as a stepping up approach to sustainably improving farm productivity, rural livelihoods and adaptive capacity of farmers and production systems while contributing to mitigation. The development of regional, sub-regional and national climate change policies and plans targeted at mitigating climate change and improving adaptive capacity of the African people have also been developed to enable mainstreaming of climate-smart agriculture into agricultural development plans.

While numerous studies have examined climate change effects on crop yields, relatively few studies have examined effects on crop quality (concentrations of nutrients, minerals, and secondary metabolites). This review article employs a culturally relevant beverage crop, tea (Camelia sinensis), as a lens to examine environmental effects linked to climate change on the directionality of crop quality. Our systematic review identified 86 articles as relevant to the review question. Findings provide evidence that shifts in seasonality, water stress, geography, light factors, altitude, herbivory and microbes, temperature, and soil factors that are linked to climate change can result in both increases and decreases up to 50% in secondary metabolites. A gap was found regarding evidence on the direct effects of carbon dioxide on tea quality, highlighting a critical research area for future study. While this systematic review provides evidence that multiple environmental parameters are impacting tea quality, the directionality and magnitude of these impacts is not clear with contradictory evidence between studies likely due to confounding factors including variation in tea variety, cultivar, specific environmental and agricultural management conditions, and differences in research methods. The environmental factors with the most consistent evidence in this systematic review were seasonality and water stress with 14 out of 18 studies (78%) demonstrating a decrease in concentrations of phenolic compounds or their bioactivity with a seasonal shift from the spring and /or first tea harvest to other seasons and seven out of 10 studies (70%) showing an increase in levels of phenolic compounds or their bioactivity with drought stress. Herbivory and soil fertility were two of the variables that showed the greatest contradictory evidence on tea quality. Both herbivory and soil fertility are variables which farmers have the greatest control over, pointing to the importance of agricultural management for climate mitigation and adaptation. The development of evidence-based management strategies and crop breeding programs for resilient cultivars are called for to mitigate climate impacts on crop quality and overall risk in agricultural and food systems.",https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpls.2019.00939/pdf,

Unlike plants, green microalgae have higher biomass productivity, will not compete with food and agriculture, and do not require fertile land for cultivation. However, microalgae biofuels currently suffer from high capital and operating costs due to low yields and costly extraction methods. Microalgae grown under optimal conditions produce large amounts of biomass but with low neutral lipid content, while microalgae grown in nutrient starvation accumulate high levels of neutral lipids but are slow growing. Producing lipids while maintaining high growth rates is vital for biofuel production because high biomass productivity increases yield per harvest volume while high lipid content decreases the cost of extraction per unit product. Therefore, there is a need for metabolic engineering of microalgae to constitutively produce high amounts of lipids without sacrificing growth. Substrate availability is a rate-limiting step in balancing growth and fatty acid (FA) production because both biomass and FA synthesis pathways compete for the same substrates, namely acetyl-CoA and NADPH. In this review, we discuss the efforts made for improving biofuel production in plants and microorganisms, the challenges faced in achieving lipid productivity, and the important role of precursor supply for FA synthesis. The main focus is placed on the enzymes which catalyzed the reactions supplying acetyl-CoA and NADPH.",https://biotechnologyforbiofuels.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s13068-016-0671-2,

However, there is currently no spatially explicit and time-continuous crop harvesting area information with a high resolution for China. The spatiotemporal patterns of major crop harvesting areas at a national scale have rarely been investigated. In this study, we proposed a new crop phenology-based crop mapping approach to generate a 1 km harvesting area dataset for three staple crops (i.e. rice, wheat, and maize) in China from 2000 to 2015 based on GLASS leaf area index (LAI) products. First, we retrieved key phenological dates of the three staple crops by combining the inflexion- and threshold-based methods. Then, we determined the grids cultivated for a certain crop if its three key phenological dates could be simultaneously identified. Finally, we developed crop classification maps and a dataset of annual harvesting areas (ChinaCropArea1 km), comprehensively considering the characteristics of crop phenology and the references of drylands and paddy fields. Compared with the county-level agricultural statistical data, the crop classification had a high accuracy, with R2 values consistently greater than 0.8. The spatiotemporal patterns of major crop harvesting areas during the period were further analyzed. The results showed that paddy rice harvesting areas had expanded aggressively in northeastern China but decreased in southern China. Maize harvesting areas expanded substantially in major maize cultivation areas across China. Wheat harvesting areas declined overall, although they increased notably in their major production areas. The spatiotemporal patterns could be ascribed to various anthropogenic, biophysical, and social-economic drivers, including urbanization, reduced cropping intensity in southern China, frequent disasters from climate change, and large areas of abandoned farmland in northern and southwestern China. The resultant dataset can be applied for many purposes, including land surface modeling, agro-ecosystem modeling, agricultural production and land use policy-making.",https://doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/ab80f0,

Imbalances between nitrogen applied and nitrogen used by crops contributes to excess nitrogen in the environment, with negative consequences for water quality, air quality, and climate change. Here we utilize crop input-yield models to investigate how to minimize nitrogen application while achieving crop production targets. We construct a tradeoff frontier that estimates the minimum nitrogen fertilizer needed to produce a range of maize, wheat, and rice production levels. Additionally, we explore potential environmental consequences by calculating excess nitrogen along the frontier using a soil surface nitrogen balance model. We find considerable opportunity to achieve greater production and decrease both nitrogen application and post-harvest excess nitrogen. Our results suggest that current (circa 2000) levels of cereal production could be achieved with ∼50% less nitrogen application and ∼60% less excess nitrogen. If current global nitrogen application were held constant but spatially redistributed, production could increase ∼30%. If current excess nitrogen were held constant, production could increase ∼40%. Efficient spatial patterns of nitrogen use on the frontier involve substantial reductions in many high-use areas and moderate increases in many low-use areas. Such changes may be difficult to achieve in practice due to infrastructure, economic, or political constraints. Increases in agronomic efficiency would expand the frontier to allow greater production and environmental gains.",https://doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/9/5/054002,

The yield of a crop may vary from year to year depending on the variations in climate, soil parameters and fertilizers used. Automation in the agricultural industry moderates the usage of resources and can increase the quality of food in the post-pandemic world. Agricultural robots have been developed for crop seeding, monitoring, weed control, pest management and harvesting. Physical counting of fruitlets, flowers or fruits at various phases of growth is labour intensive as well as an expensive procedure for crop yield estimation. Remote sensing technologies offer accuracy and reliability in crop yield prediction and estimation. The automation in image analysis with computer vision and deep learning models provides precise field and yield maps.

Over the coming decades, climate change will affect the natural resource base of livestock production, especially the productivity of rangeland and feed crops. Based on a comprehensive impact modeling chain, we assess implications of different climate projections for agricultural production costs and land use change and explore the effectiveness of livestock system transitions as an adaptation strategy. Simulated climate impacts on crop yields and rangeland productivity generate adaptation costs amounting to 3% of total agricultural production costs in 2045 (i.e. 145 billion US$). Shifts in livestock production towards mixed crop-livestock systems represent a resource- and cost-efficient adaptation option, reducing agricultural adaptation costs to 0.3% of total production costs and simultaneously abating deforestation by about 76 million ha globally. The relatively positive climate impacts on grass yields compared with crop yields favor grazing systems inter alia in South Asia and North America. Incomplete transitions in production systems already have a strong adaptive and cost reducing effect: a 50% shift to mixed systems lowers agricultural adaptation costs to 0.8%. General responses of production costs to system transitions are robust across different global climate and crop models as well as regarding assumptions on CO2 fertilization, but simulated values show a large variation. In the face of these uncertainties, public policy support for transforming livestock production systems provides an important lever to improve agricultural resource management and lower adaptation costs, possibly even contributing to emission reduction.",https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/10/9/094021/pdf,

Microclimatic parameters, crop development and harvestable yields were monitored in 2017 and 2018. Overall, an alteration in microclimatic conditions and crop production under AV was confirmed. Photosynthetic active radiation was on average reduced by about 30% under AV. During summertime, soil temperature was decreased under AV in both years. Furthermore, reduced soil moisture and air temperatures as well as an altered rain distribution have been found under AV. In both years, plant height of all crops was increased under AV.

In addition, influence of organic farming on health related compounds, on pesticide residues and heavy metals in crops, and relations between organic food and health biomarkers as well as in vitro studies are also the focus of the present paper. Nutritionally beneficial compounds of highest relevance for public health were micronutrients, especially Fe and Zn, and bioactive compounds such as carotenoids (including pro-vitamin A compounds), tocopherols (including vitamin E) and phenolic compounds. Extremely large variations in the contents of these compounds were seen, depending on genotype, climate, environment, farming conditions, harvest time, and part of the crop. Highest amounts seen were related to the choice of genotype and were also increased by genetic modification of the crop. Organic cultivation did not influence the content of most of the nutritional beneficial compounds, except the phenolic compounds that were increased with the amounts of pathogens. However, higher amounts of pesticide residues and in many cases also of heavy metals were seen in the conventionally produced crops compared to the organic ones.

This is so because extreme weather conditions induced by climate change are detrimental to most crops and affect the expected quantity of agricultural production. Although there is no way to fully mitigate these natural phenomena, it could be much better if there is information known earlier about the future so that farmers can plan accordingly. Early information sharing about expected crop production may support food insecurity risk reduction. In this regard, this work employs data mining techniques to predict future crop (i.e., Irish potatoes and Maize) harvests using weather and yields historical data for Musanze, a district in Rwanda. The study applies machine learning techniques to predict crop harvests based on weather data and communicate the information about production trends. Weather data and crop yields for Irish potatoes and maize were gathered from various sources. The collected data were analyzed through Random Forest, Polynomial Regression, and Support Vector Regressor. Rainfall and temperature were used as predictors. The models were trained and tested. The results indicate that Random Forest is the best model with root mean square error of 510.8 and 129.9 for potato and maize, respectively, whereas R2 was 0.875 and 0.817 for the same crops datasets. The optimum weather conditions for the optimal crop yield were identified for each crop. The results suggests that Random Forest is recommended model for early crop yield prediction.

Through a round‐table, dual‐language workshop discussion and literature evaluation, we recognized 59 political, economic, legal, social, logistical and research challenges, for which five key underlying factors were identified. These challenges relate to the 3Rs adopted by the Indonesian Peatland Restoration Agency (Rewetting, Revegetation and Revitalization), plus a fourth R that we suggest is essential to incorporate into (peatland) conservation planning: Reducing Fires. Our analysis suggests that (a) all challenges have potential for impact on activities under all 4Rs, and many are inter‐dependent and mutually reinforcing, implying that narrowly focused solutions are likely to carry a higher risk of failure; (b) addressing challenges relating to Rewetting and Reducing Fire is critical for achieving goals in all 4Rs, as is considering the local socio‐political situation and acquiring local government and community support; and (c) the suite of challenges faced, and thus conservation interventions required to address these, will be unique to each project, depending on its goals and prevailing local environmental, social and political conditions.

Mostly overlooked is whether gender influences influenced perception of effectiveness of adaptation practices and preferences for institutional support for future adaptation. Using key informant interviews, household surveys, and focus group discussions, we address these gaps by exploring coping and adaptation measures adopted by heads of farm households to counter climate change impacts on their livelihood activities and household well-being in the Guinea Savanna agroecological zone in Ghana. Additionally, we assessed the preferred institutional adaptation support of heads of farm households in adapting to future projected impacts. We find that female heads of farm households relied mainly on borrowed money from village savings and loans group as a coping measure; male heads of farm households depended primarily on sales of livestock. Varying planting and harvesting dates, crop diversification, and use of improved crop varieties were the major adaptation strategies adopted by farmers. We argue that provision of dams and/or dugouts, postharvest processing facilities, adaptation capacity-building resources, and improved access to markets and credit could enhance the adaptive capacity of male and female heads of farm households to mitigate projected climate change impacts on their livelihood activities and household well-being.",https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3298/5/8/86/pdf?version=1532662651,

Chinyanja Triangle is a region that is increasingly experiencing mid-season dry spells and an increase in occurrence of drought, which is attributed largely to climate variability and change. This poses high agricultural production risks, which aggravate poverty and food insecurity. For this region, adoption of small-scale irrigation farming as a climate-smart agriculture practice is very important. Through a binary logistic and ordinary least squares regression, this article determines factors that influence the adoption of small-scale irrigation farming as a climate-smart agriculture practice and its influence on income among smallholder farmers. The results show that off-farm employment, access to irrigation equipment, access to reliable water sources and awareness of water conservation practices, such as rainwater harvesting, have a significant influence on the adoption of small-scale irrigation farming. On the other hand, the farmer’s age, distance travelled to the nearest market and nature of employment negatively influence the adoption of small-scale irrigation farming decisions. Ordinary least squares regression results showed that the adoption of small-scale irrigation farming as a climate-smart agriculture practice has a significant positive influence on agricultural income. We therefore conclude that to empower smallholder farmers to respond quickly to climate variability and change, practices that will enhance the adoption of small-scale irrigation farming in the Chinyanja Triangle are critical, as this will significantly affect agricultural income. In terms of policy, we recommend that the governments of Zambia, Malawi and Mozambique, which cover the Chinyanja Triangle, formulate policies that will enhance the adoption of sustainable small scale-irrigation farming as a climate-smart agriculture practice. This will go a long way in mitigating the adverse effects that accompany climate variability and change in the region.",https://www.mdpi.com/2073-445X/7/2/49/pdf?version=1525348521,

The past 30 years has witnessed a dramatic reemergence of epidemic vector-borne diseases throughout much of the world (Atkinson, 2010). Prior to the development and commercial success of synthetic insecticides in the mid1930s to 1950s, botanical insecticides were the foremost weapons against insect pests. The synthetic insecticides (organochlorines, organophosphates, carbamates and later the pyrethroids and neonicotinoids) are characterized by efficacy, speed of action, ease of use, and low cost. Accordingly, they drove many natural control methods, such as using of botanicals, predators, and parasitoids to near obscurity. Twenty years after synthetic insecticides were overzealously entrenched in ‘modern’ agricultural production; they induce widespread environmental contamination, toxicity to non-target organisms, development of resistance against insecticides, and negative effects on animal and human health (Pretty, 2009). Consequently, there is an urgent need to explore and utilize naturally occurring products for combating pests. The terms “biorational pesticide” and “biopesticides” are gaining popularity in the current climate of environmental awareness and public concern. Both terms are derived from two words, “biological” and “rational”, referring to pesticides that have limited or no adverse effects on the environment, nontarget organisms including humans. Biorational insecticides include: biochemicals insecticides (botanicals, insect growth regulators, insect pheromones, photoinsecticides, and inorganics); biological insecticides, using of natural enemies such as parasitoids, predators, nematodes, and pathogens (virus, bacteria, fungi, or protozoa); and transgenic insecticides (genetically modified plants or organisms). Natural enemies play an important role in limiting potential pest populations and they are more likely to survive in case of application of ecofriendly biopesticides. Approaches to the biological control of insects include: conservation of existing natural enemies; introducing new natural enemies and establishing a permanent population (called “classical biological control”); and mass rearing and periodic release, either as a seasonal introduction of a small population of natural enemies, or a massive, “inundative” release. In developing countries, biopesticides offer unique and challenging opportunities for exploration and development of their own biorational insecticides.

In Tanzania as in most African countries, farming depends almost entirely on rainfall, a situation that makes agriculture and thus rural livelihoods especially in semiarid environments particularly vulnerable to climate change. This study analyses the impacts of climate change and variability on rural livelihoods with particular focus on agricultural production, food security and adaptive capacities in semiarid areas of Tanzania. The methods used in this study included focus group discussions, key informant interviews, household surveys and field observations. Results from the study indicate that communities understood climate change in terms of variability in rainfall patterns and amount, temperature patterns, wind, water availability, increased incidences of drought and decreased agricultural productivity. Communities in the study area acknowledged that while rainfall amounts have decreased over the last thirty years, temperatures have increased; an experience is also supported by meteorological data. Such changes were claimed to have reduced agricultural productivity particularly due to prolonged drought, inadequate and uneven distribution of rainfall as well as unpredictable onset and ending of rains. Stressors such as crop diseases and pests, low soil fertility and inadequate extension services were also reported to contribute to the decline in agricultural productivity and re-occurrence of food insecurity. In response, communities have developed multiple adaptation strategies, including growing of drought tolerant and early maturing crop varieties, increasing wetlands cultivation, water harvesting for small-scale irrigation and livestock keeping. However, households with limited livelihood assets are more vulnerable to the impacts of climate change and food insecurity. The study argues that diversification of adaptive strategies, such as water harvesting for small-scale irrigation, integration of livestock and crop production are crucial to ensuring sustainable livelihood in a changing climate.",http://www.scirp.org/journal/PaperDownload.aspx?paperID=33833,

While these models have generally been developed as separate applications, each with a separate purpose and audience, they share many common features. We present a general framework, called a state‐and‐transition simulation model (STSM), which captures a number of these common features, accompanied by a software product, called ST‐Sim, to build and run such models. The STSM method divides a landscape into a set of discrete spatial units and simulates the discrete state of each cell forward as a discrete‐time‐inhomogeneous stochastic process. The method differs from a spatially interacting Markov chain in several important ways, including the ability to add discrete counters such as age and time‐since‐transition as state variables, to specify one‐step transition rates as either probabilities or target areas, and to represent multiple types of transitions between pairs of states. We demonstrate the STSM method using a model of land‐use/land‐cover (LULC) change for the state of Hawai'i, USA. Processes represented in this example include expansion/contraction of agricultural lands, urbanization, wildfire, shrub encroachment into grassland and harvest of tree plantations; the model also projects shifts in moisture zones due to climate change. Key model output includes projections of the future spatial and temporal distribution of LULC classes and moisture zones across the landscape over the next 50 years. State‐and‐transition simulation models can be applied to a wide range of landscapes, including questions of both land‐use change and vegetation dynamics. Because the method is inherently stochastic, it is well suited for characterizing uncertainty in model projections. When combined with the ST‐Sim software, STSMs offer a simple yet powerful means for developing a wide range of models of landscape dynamics.",https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1111/2041-210X.12597,

Increases in productivity achieved in the past are attributed in part to the significant use of fossil fuels. Energy use in agriculture is therefore also expected to rise in the future, further contributing to greenhouse emissions. At the same time, more than two-fifths of the world’s population still depends on unsustainably harvested wood energy for cooking and heating. Both types of energy use have detrimental impacts on the climate and natural resources. Continuing on this path is not an option as it will put additional pressure on the already stressed natural resource base and local livelihoods, while climate change is further reducing the resilience of agro-ecosystems and smallholder farmers. Ecosystem approaches that combine both food and energy production, such as agroforestry or integrated crop–livestock–biogas systems, could substantially mitigate these risks while providing both food and energy to rural and urban populations. Information and understanding on how to change course through the implementation of the practices outlined in this paper are urgently needed. Yet the scientific basis of such integrated systems, which is essential to inform decision-makers and to secure policy support, is still relatively scarce.

It is ubiquitous in distribution, being found in a variety of environments (plant surfaces, soil, water, rock surfaces and manmade surfaces), and with a worldwide distribution from cold to warm climates and wet/humid regions to arid ones. Isolates and strains of A. pullulans produce a wide range of natural products well documented in the international literature and which have been regarded as safe for biotechnological and environmental applications. Showing antagonistic activity against plant pathogens (especially post-harvest pathogens) is one of the major applications currently in agriculture of the fungus, with nutrient and space competition, production of volatile organic compounds, and production of hydrolytic enzymes and antimicrobial compounds (antibacterial and antifungal). The fungus also shows a positive role on mycotoxin biocontrol through various modes, with the most striking being that of binding and/or absorption. A. pullulans strains have been reported to produce very useful industrial enzymes, such as β-glucosidase, amylases, cellulases, lipases, proteases, xylanases and mannanases. Pullulan (poly-α-1,6-maltotriose biopolymer) is an A. pullulans trademark product with significant properties and biotechnological applications in the food, cosmetic and pharmaceutical industries. Poly (β-l-malic acid), or PMA, which is a natural biopolyester, and liamocins, a group of produced heavy oils and siderophores, are among other valuable compounds detected that are of possible biotechnological use. The fungus also shows a potential single-cell protein source capacity with high levels of nucleic acid components and essential amino acids, but this remains to be further explored. Last but not least, the fungus has shown very good biocontrol against aerial plant pathogens. All these properties are of major interest in the vitivinicultural sector and are thoroughly reviewed under this prism, concluding on the importance that A. pullulans may have if used at both vineyard and winery levels.

Accounting for harvest, grazing and tillage resulted in cumulative ELUC since 1850 ca. 70% larger than in simulations ignoring these processes, but also changed the timescale over which these emissions occurred and led to underestimations of the carbon sequestered by possible future reforestation actions. The vast majority of Earth system models in the recent IPCC Fifth Assessment Report omit these processes, suggesting either an overestimation in their present-day ST, or an underestimation of SL, of up to 1.0 Pg C a−1. Management processes influencing crop productivity per se are important for food supply, but were found to have little influence on ELUC.",https://doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/10/12/124008,

Using a dataset of 450 farm households collected from three agro-ecological zones, this study examines rural networks, assesses farm-level institutional support and documents any existing structural gaps on climate change adaptation in the agricultural sector of Pakistan. For this purpose, a social network analysis method is used. The study findings reveal that farmers reported a decrease in crop production and increase in pests and diseases due to climate change. Further, changing crop varieties, sowing dates, input mixes and planting trees are the key measures adopted by farmers. Lack of information, finances and resources are the key adaptation constraints. The study findings show that only 28% and 13% of the respondents do not have access to financial services and climate adaptation knowledge, respectively. Support to farmers mainly consists of marketing information and farm equipment from community-based organizations, while private institutions offer weather forecasting services. Public institutions are poorly represented in the network analysis. We also found that extension services are key institutions in the climate adaptation network, while agricultural credits, post-harvest services and marketing of produce were dominant but weakly connected in the financial support network. We also found that with an increase in the provision of services at the farm level, farmers not only adapt more but also move from low-cost and short-term measures to advanced measures.

It grows optimally at 25 °C with a minimum necessary water activity of 0.75. It starts to produce secondary metabolites at 10-12 oC, but the most toxic ones are produced at 25°C with a water activity of 0.95 (Hesseltine 1976). Those toxic secondary metabolites named aflatoxins (AF) is a group of mycotoxins produced by a large number of Aspergillus species, basically by three phylogenetically distinct sections. The main producers are A. flavus, and A. parasiticus, but it has been demonstrated that A. nomius, A. pseudotamarii, A. parvisclerotigenus, and A.bombycis of section Flavi, A. ochraceoroseus and A. rambellii from section Ochraceorosei and Emericella astellata and E. venezuelensis from Nidulatans section also generate aflatoxins (IARC 2002; Frisvad et. al., 2005). All of them contaminate a large fraction of the world’s food, including maize, rice, sorghum, barley, rye, wheat, peanut, groundnut, soya, cottonseed, and other derivative products made from these primary feedstuffs in low-income countries (Rizzi et al., 2003; Saleemullah et al., 2006; Strosnider et. al., 2006; Masoero et. al., 2007; Caloni, 2010). Although aflatoxins have been a problem throughout history, until 1960 they have been recognized as significant contaminants within agriculture, because in this year they were initially isolated and identified as the causative toxins in “Turkey-X-disease” after 100,000 turkeys died in England from an acute necrosis of the liver and hyperplasia of the bile duct after consuming groundnuts infected with Aspergillus flavus (Asao et. al., 1965; D’Mello, 1997; Strosnider et. al., 2006). Williams et al. estimated in 2004 that 4.5 billion of the world’s population is exposed to aflatoxins because they are also everywhere. Some essential factors that affect aflatoxin contamination include the climate of the region, the genotype of the crop planted, the soil type, the minimum and maximum daily temperatures, and the daily net evaporation (Strosnider et. al., 2006). Moreover, aflatoxin contamination is also promoted by stress or damage to the crop due to drought before harvest, the insect activity, a poor timing of harvest, the heavy rains during and after harvest, and an inadequate drying of the crop before storage.

The establishment and management of vegetated strips adjacent to farmed fields (including various field margins, buffer strips and hedgerows) are commonly advocated mitigation measures for these negative environmental impacts. However, it may be difficult to obtain reliable evidence on the effects of implementation and management of vegetated strips, even though a substantial body of evidence exists. We describe a systematic map of research relating to vegetated strips in boreo-temperate farming systems to answer the question: What evidence exists regarding the effects of field margins on nutrients, pollutants, socioeconomics, biodiversity, and soil retention in boreo-temperate systems?MethodsWe searched 13 bibliographic databases, 1 search engine and 37 websites of stakeholder organisations using a predefined and tested search string focusing on a comprehensive list of English language vegetated strip synonyms. Searches in Danish, Finnish, Spanish, and Swedish were also conducted using web searches. We screened search results at title, abstract and full text levels, recording the number of studies deemed non-relevant (with reasons at full text). A systematic map database of meta-data (i.e. descriptive summary information about the settings and methods) for relevant studies was produced following full text assessment. The systematic map database is provided as an evidence atlas: interactive, web-based geographical information system.ResultsOver 31,000 search results were identified, resulting in a total of 1072 relevant primary research studies and 130 evidence reviews. Articles used a variety of terminology to describe vegetated strips, with ‘field margin’, ‘hedgerow’, ‘shelterbelt’ and ‘riparian buffer’ most common. The volume of primary research is increasing linearly year-by-year, whilst the increase in reviews has tailed off in the last 10 years. The USA and UK were most frequently studied and reviewed. Arable systems were investigated in c. 70% of primary research but 50% of reviews. Some 50% of primary research vegetated strips were field edge and 25% riparian, whilst riparian and field edge strips were roughly equally the focus of around a half of all described strips in reviews. Terrestrial biodiversity, nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus) and soil/water loss or retention were the most commonly measured outcomes in primary studies and reviews, although some other outcomes were more common in reviews than research articles (e.g. pesticides).ConclusionsWe identified substantial bodies of evidence on particular sets of related outcomes and ecosystem services, which constitute important knowledge clusters/synthesis gaps relating to: strip width, terrestrial biodiversity, nutrient retention, hydrological regimes, toxic substances, erosion protection, pests, carbon sequestration, and soil and biodiversity combined. We also identified key knowledge gaps relating to: climate regulation, freshwater biodiversity, strip harvesting, cultural ecosystem services, long-term impacts, the relationship between pest populations and crop yield, fuel and fibre production, specific regions and countries (e.g. Russia and South America), and multi-use vegetated strips.

There is no consensus on the etiology. Anecdotal evidence from the 1990s pointed to work in sugarcane; pesticides and heat stress were suspected. Subsequent population-based surveys supported an occupational origin with overall high male-female ratios in high-risk lowlands, but small sex differences within occupational categories, and low prevalence in non-workers. CKDnt was reported in sugarcane and other high-intensity agriculture, and in non-agricultural occupations with heavy manual labor in hot environments, but not among subsistence farmers. Recent studies with stronger designs have shown cross-shift changes in kidney function and hydration biomarkers and cross-harvest kidney function declines related to heat and workload. The implementation of a water-rest-shade intervention midharvest in El Salvador appeared to halt declining kidney function among cane cutters. In Nicaragua a water-rest-shade program appeared sufficient to prevent kidney damage among cane workers with low-moderate workload but not among cutters with heaviest workload. Studies on pesticides and infectious risk factors have been largely negative. Non-occupational risk factors do not explain the observed epidemiologic patterns. In conclusion, work is the main driver of the CKDnt epidemic in Mesoamerica, with occupational heat stress being the single uniting factor shown to lead to kidney dysfunction in affected populations. Sugarcane cutters with extreme heat stress could be viewed as a sentinel occupational population. Occupational heat stress prevention is critical, even more so in view of climate change.",https://iris.paho.org/bitstream/handle/10665.2/51826/v44e152020.pdf;jsessionid=F309D394B276CC925DF0ABD52BDB39FA?sequence=1,

After agriculture, wood harvest is the human activity that has most reduced the storage of carbon in vegetation and soils^ 1 , 2 . Although felled wood releases carbon to the atmosphere in various steps, the fact that growing trees absorb carbon has led to different carbon-accounting approaches for wood use, producing widely varying estimates of carbon costs. Many approaches give the impression of low, zero or even negative greenhouse gas emissions from wood harvests because, in different ways, they offset carbon losses from new harvests with carbon sequestration from growth of broad forest areas^ 3 , 4 . Attributing this sequestration to new harvests is inappropriate because this other forest growth would occur regardless of new harvests and typically results from agricultural abandonment, recovery from previous harvests and climate change itself. Nevertheless some papers count gross emissions annually, which assigns no value to the capacity of newly harvested forests to regrow and approach the carbon stocks of unharvested forests. Here we present results of a new model that uses time discounting to estimate the present and future carbon costs of global wood harvests under different scenarios. We find that forest harvests between 2010 and 2050 will probably have annualized carbon costs of 3.5–4.2 Gt CO_2e yr^−1, which approach common estimates of annual emissions from land-use change due to agricultural expansion.

Examples on wild species include responses to harvest (e.g. fisheries, hunting, angling), habitat loss and fragmentation (e.g. genetic effects of isolation), biotic exchange (e.g. evolutionary responses to control measures), climate change (e.g. local adaptation and its interplay with dispersal processes) and the responses of endangered species to conservation measures.

Such opportunities should be extended to other sectoral policies of direct relevance for biodiversity – notably nature conservation, fisheries, agriculture, water resources, spatial planning and climate change.

Bottom-up scaling of net ecosystem production (NEP) and net biome production (NBP) was used to generate a carbon budget for a large heterogeneous region (the state of Oregon, 2.5×105 km2) in the western United States. Landsat resolution (30 m) remote sensing provided the basis for mapping land cover and disturbance history, thus allowing us to account for all major fire and logging events over the last 30 years. For NEP, a 23-year record (1980–2002) of distributed meteorology (1 km resolution) at the daily time step was used to drive a process-based carbon cycle model (Biome-BGC). For NBP, fire emissions were computed from remote sensing based estimates of area burned and our mapped biomass estimates. Our estimates for the contribution of logging and crop harvest removals to NBP were from the model simulations and were checked against public records of forest and crop harvesting. The predominately forested ecoregions within our study region had the highest NEP sinks, with ecoregion averages up to 197 gC m−2 yr−1. Agricultural ecoregions were also NEP sinks, reflecting the imbalance of NPP and decomposition of crop residues. For the period 1996–2000, mean NEP for the study area was 17.0 TgC yr−1, with strong interannual variation (SD of 10.6). The sum of forest harvest removals, crop removals, and direct fire emissions amounted to 63% of NEP, leaving a mean NBP of 6.1 TgC yr−1. Carbon sequestration was predominantly on public forestland, where the harvest rate has fallen dramatically in the recent years. Comparison of simulation results with estimates of carbon stocks, and changes in carbon stocks, based on forest inventory data showed generally good agreement. The carbon sequestered as NBP, plus accumulation of forest products in slow turnover pools, offset 51% of the annual emissions of fossil fuel CO2 for the state. State-level NBP dropped below zero in 2002 because of the combination of a dry climate year and a large (200 000 ha) fire. These results highlight the strong influence of land management and interannual variation in climate on the terrestrial carbon flux in the temperate zone.",https://bg.copernicus.org/articles/4/597/2007/bg-4-597-2007.pdf,

Recent studies have proven remote sensing is an efficient method for yield estimation and machine learning, especially deep learning, can infer a good prediction by integrating multisource datasets such as satellite data, climate data, soil data, and so on. However, there are some bottleneck challenges to improve accuracy. First, the popular remote sensing data used for yield prediction fall into two major groups—time-series data and constant data. Surprisingly little attention has been devoted to deep learning networks which can integrate the two kinds of data effectively; second, both temporal and spatial features play a role in affecting the yields. But most of the existing approaches employed either convolutional neural network (CNN) or recurrent neural network (RNN). CNN cannot learn temporal patterns, while RNN barely can learn spatial characteristics. This work proposed a novel multilevel deep learning model coupling RNN and CNN to extract both spatial and temporal features. The inputs include both time-series remote sensing data, soil property data, and the model outputs yield.

Open biomass burning (OBB) has significant impacts on air pollution, climate change and potential human health. OBB has gathered wide attention but with little focus on the annual variation of pollutant emission. Central and eastern China (CEC) is one of the most polluted regions in China. This study aims to provide a state-of-the-art estimation of the pollutant emissions from OBB in CEC from 2003 to 2015, by adopting the satellite observation dataset – the burned area product (MCD64Al) and the active fire product (MCD14 ML) – along with local biomass data (updated biomass loading data and high-resolution vegetation data) and local emission factors. The successful adoption of the double satellite dataset for long-term estimation of pollutants from OBB with a high spatial resolution can support the assessing of OBB on regional air quality, especially for harvest periods or dry seasons. It is also useful to evaluate the effects of annual OBB management policies in different regions. Here, monthly emissions of pollutants were estimated and allocated into a 1×1 km spatial grid for four types of OBB including grassland, shrubland, forest and cropland. From 2003 to 2015, the emissions from forest, shrubland and grassland fire burning had an annual fluctuation, whereas the emissions from crop straw burning steadily increased. The cumulative emissions of organic carbon (OC), elemental carbon (EC), methane (CH4), nitric oxide (NOx), non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs), sulfur dioxide (SO2), ammonia (NH3), carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO2) and fine particles (PM2.5) were 3.64×103, 2.87×102, 3.05×103, 1.82×103, 6.4×103, 2.12×102, 4.67×102, 4.59×104, 9.39×105 and 4.13×103 Gg in these years, respectively. Crop straw burning was the largest contributor for all pollutant emissions, by 84 %–96 %. For the forest, shrubland and grassland fire burning, forest fire burning emissions contributed the most, and emissions from grassland fire were negligible due to little grass coverage in this region. High pollutant emissions concentrated in the connection area of Shandong, Henan, Jiangsu and Anhui, with emission intensity higher than 100 tons per square kilometer, which was related to the frequent agricultural activities in these regions. Peak emission of pollutants occurred during summer and autumn harvest periods including May, June, September and October, during which ∼50 % of the total pollutant emissions were emitted in these months. This study highlights the importance of controlling the crop straw burning emissions. From December to March, the crop residue burning emissions decreased, while the emissions from forest, shrubland and grassland exhibited their highest values, leading to another small peak in emissions of pollutants. Obvious regional differences in seasonal variations of OBB were observed due to different local biomass types and environmental conditions. Rural population, agricultural output, economic levels, local burning habits, social customs and management policies were all influencing factors for OBB emissions.",https://acp.copernicus.org/articles/18/11623/2018/acp-18-11623-2018.pdf,

However, it suffers from several agronomic problems that limit productivity and postharvest quality. To reduce losses, new information is needed to better describe the impact of crop load on productivity and postharvest fruit quality in a desert environment and the major region where ‘Honeycrisp’ expansion is occurring. Here, 7-year-old ‘Honeycrisp’ trees on the M9Nic29 rootstock (2.53 0.9 m) were hand thinned to five different crop loads [from 4.7 to 16.0 fruit/cm of trunk cross-sectional area (TCSA)] to compare fruit quality, maturity, fruit size, elemental concentration, and return bloom. Fruit size distribution was affected by crop load. Trees with the highest crop load (16 fruit/cm) produced smaller fruit. Index of absorbance difference (IAD) measurements (absorption difference between 670 and 720 nm), a proxy indicator of the chlorophyll content below the skin of fruit measured by a DA-meter, were made shortly after harvest (T0) and after 6 months of storage (T1). Fruit from the trees with the lowest crop load had lower IAD values indicating advanced fruit ripeness. The comparison between the IAD classes at T0 and T1 showed that fruit belonging to the lowest IAD class had significantly higher redblushed overcolor percentage, firmness, dry matter, and soluble solid content than those in the ‘‘most unripe’’ class (highest IAD readings) regardless of crop load. The percentage of blushed color, firmness, titratable acidity (TA), soluble solids content, and dry matter were all higher in the lowest crop loads at both T0 and T1. Fruit calcium (Ca) concentration was lowest at the lowest crop load. The (K + Mg + N):Ca ratio decreased as crop load increased until a crop load of 11.3 fruit/cm, which was not significantly different from higher crop loads. For return bloom, the highest number of flower clusters per tree was reported for 4.7 fruit/cm crop load, and generally it decreased as crop load increased. Here, we highlight the corresponding changes in fruit quality, storability, and elemental balance with tree crop load. To maintain high fruit quality and consistency in yield, careful crop load management is required to minimize bienniality and improve fruit quality and storability. The apple variety, ‘Honeycrisp’, is a premium fresh fruit marketplace variety (Embree et al., 2007; Rosenberger et al., 2004) selected in Minnesota. As such, it is well adapted to northern climatic conditions (Luby and Bedford, 1990). ‘Honeycrisp’ is a profitable apple for growers and, for this reason, the acreage is expanding from cold to warmer areas (Nichols and Wright, 2003) including Washington State. Orchard management and the production of high quality for ‘Honeycrisp’ fruit can be challenging, especially in hot climate areas like Washington State. Washington’s climate varies greatly from west to east. In the Columbia Basin, one of the main area for apple production, the climate is semiarid (http://www.wrcc.dri. edu). Early fruit production before the trees have developed a complete canopy can permanently limit the final tree size and consequently, can impact future productivity (Castro et al., 2015). Crop load management is particularly important for ‘Honeycrisp’ because it can limit inconsistent annual flowering and fruit set (Embree et al., 2007), improve fruit quality (Baugher and Schupp, 2010), and decrease susceptibility to storage disorders (Robinson and Watkins, 2009). ‘Honeycrisp’ has exhibited an extreme predisposition to overcropping, therefore, is susceptible to biennial bearing (Crassweller et al., 2005; Embree and Nichols, 2005; Robinson and Watkins, 2003; Wright et al., 2006), especially when thinning is completed too late (Pellerin et al., 2011, 2012). Thinning is a common agronomical practice to optimize crop load to improve fruit size and quality as well as reducing biennial bearing (Dennis, 2000; Link, 2000; Wertheim, 2000). Thinning affects the cell number and fruit size (Bain and Robertson, 1951), and is considered effective within 4 to 12 weeks after full bloom, while its efficacy is cultivar dependent (Bergh, 1990; Denne, 1960). Both crop load and warmer climate conditions can affect the balance of nutrients in the fruits and leaves and, subsequently, affects postharvest fruit quality and postharvest susceptibility to storage disorders. Young ‘Honeycrisp’ orchards are susceptible to bitter pit and symptoms can appear before harvest or during storage (Rosenberger et al., 2004). High vegetative vigor can lead to transpiration imbalances and less Ca being allocated to the developing fruit (W€unsche and Ferguson, 2005). These effects may be further magnified in a hot, desert climate where transpiration pressures are greater. The amount of affected fruit can increase dramatically in situations of excessive vigor and/or low crop loads. Bitter pit is associated with low Ca concentration in fruit and the elemental balance between Ca, potassium (K), magnesium (Mg), and nitrogen (N). High concentrations of K, Mg, and N are associated with an increase in the percentage of fruit lost to bitter pit. Crop load has a strong effect on fruit size (Embree et al., 2007). Fruit size can also be influenced by low soil pH, boron deficiency, and environmental stress such as drought (Faust and Shear, 1968; Ferguson and Watkins, 1989; Rosenberger et al., 2004). Bangerth (1979) and W€unsche and Ferguson (2005) reported that larger fruit have lower Ca concentrations suggesting that high fruit growth rates in late stages of fruit development can lead to fruit Ca deficiencies. High crop loads can limit tree vigor and fruit size and can decrease the incidence of this physiological disorder. However, it is well known that a high crop load can reduce size, color appearance, lower flesh firmness, lower sugars, and acidity of fruits (Embree et al., 2007; Hampson and Kemp, 2003) in addition to return bloom the following year. Crop load can also affect the photosynthesis in apple tree (Palmer et al., 1997) and dry matter Received for publication 2 Oct. 2015. Accepted for publication 13 Jan. 2016.

The effect of crop load on ‘Honeycrisp’ postharvest quality has not been widely reported in Washington State. Here, the main objective was to determine the impact of different crop loads on fruit quality, storability, nutritional balance, and return of bloom in ‘Honeycrisp’ in a desert environment. Our hypothesis was that lower crop loads would promote more return bloom and increase fruit quality for ‘Honeycrisp’ grown in warmer climates. Additionally, our preliminary work indicated that a nondestructive approach using the DA-meter (Ziosi et al., 2008) can be used to predict quality attributes of pome fruit in storage. Additionally, we sought to further test the application of DA-meter for ‘Honeycrisp’ fruit maturity and storability assessments. Understanding the impact of tree crop load on mineral nutritional balance in combination with fruit quality, ripening, and storability can help to optimize tree management and better identify optimum crop loads suitable for ‘Honeycrisp’ grown in warmer climates. Materials and Methods Field conditions. The experimental field was located in Naches, WA (46 43#23.01##N, 120 40#26.07##W). Seven-year-old apple trees cv. Honeycrisp grafted on M9-NIC29 were trained to a vertical axis with a planting density of 2.5 · 0.9 m (4444 trees/ha). The orchard was watered with drip irrigation and mulched along the rows with coarse bark chips. Soil in the trial location was collected (at 20 cm from the trunk under the mulch) at two depths (0–30 and 30–60 cm) pooling together three rows. Soil was classified as a loam (U.S. Department of Agriculture texture) with 50% sand, 12% clay, and 38% silt in the first 30 cm of soil sampling, while 40% sand, 14% clay, and 46% silt in 30–60 cm depth. pH was 7.7 and 7.2 at the two depths, respectively, which is a little higher than conventional apple orchards in the same region of Washington (Glover et al., 2000). Soil analysis did not indicate abnormal nutrient or pH imbalances and fertility was managed with a combination of fertigation applied with drip irrigation and foliar treatments. Tree size was variable within the orchard. To limit the effect of tree-to-tree variation on fruit productivity and quality during tree sample selection, trunk cross-sectional area was measured for 40 trees that ranged from 5.2 to 10.0 cm (Supplemental Fig. 1). Fifteen homogeneous trees (average height 314 cm) were selected with a trunk cross-sectional area between 7 and 9 cm (measured at 15 cm from the grafting point). In 2014, full bloom in the experimental block occurred during the last week of April. At the end of June, sample trees were hand thinned to five different crop load targets; 30–40, 50–65, 75–85, 90–100, and 125–135 fruit/tree, which at harvest averaged 34, 56, 84, 95, and 130 fruit/tree, respectively. Converting to fruit/TCSA cm crop was equal to 4.7, 7.5, 11.3, 12.5, and 16.0 fruit/TCSA cm, from low to high crop loads described above, respectively. These were the actual number of fruit remaining on the tree at harvest and, therefore, crop loads were not evenly distributed between treatments. Fruit analysis. Fruit were harvested in a single picking (1 week before commercial harvest) on 28 Aug. 2014. The number of fruits and yield (kg/tree) were measured for each tree. Yield per tree and total number of fruit per tree were combined with trunk crosssectional area to calculate yield efficiency (kg/cm) and crop load (fruit/cm), respectively. Fruit from each tree was categorized into fruit size classes (<55, 55–59, 60–64, 65–69, 70",https://journals.ashs.org/downloadpdf/journals/hortsci/51/3/article-p236.pdf,

The crop contributes about 20 % of the total dietary calories and proteins worldwide. Food demand in the developing regions is growing by 1 % annually and varies from 170 kg in Central Asia to 27 kg in East and South Africa. The developing regions (including China and Central Asia) account for roughly 53 % of the total harvested area and 50 % of the production. Unprecedented productivity growth from the Green Revolution (GR) since the 1960s dramatically transformed world wheat production, benefitting both producers and consumers through low production costs and low food prices. Modern wheat varieties were adopted more rapidly than any other technological innovation in the history of agriculture, recently reaching about 90 % of the area in developing regions. One of the key challenges today is to replace these varieties with new ones for better sustainability. While the GR “spared” essential ecosystems from conversion to agriculture, it also generated its own environmental problems. Also productivity increase is now slow or static. Achieving the productivity gains needed to ensure food security will therefore require more than a repeat performance of the GR of the past. Future demand will need to be achieved through sustainable intensification that combines better crop resistance to diseases and pests, adaptation to warmer climates, and reduced use of water, fertilizer, labor and fuel. Meeting these challenges will require concerted efforts in research and innovation to develop and deploy viable solutions. Substantive investment will be required to realize sustainable productivity growth through better technologies and policy and institutional innovations that facilitate farmer adoption and adaptation.

Unifying the aspirations of the nutrition and sustainable agriculture communities into a single statement presents a unique opportunity to align the goals of these sectors in a common and even more ambitious cause. A productive, diverse, ecologically and socially sustainable agricultural sector has long been recognized as crucial for shaping healthy diets and improving human nutrition. More than three-quarters of a century ago, the League of Nations recognized the importance of agricultural adaptation for dietary diversification, noting that changes in production decisions that supported more protective foods (i.e. fruits and vegetables), could lead to nutritional benefits.1 Observers today continue to call attention to the importance of food systems for shaping human health and nutrition.2,3 That our systems of food production should be designed to meet recommendations for healthy diets seems obvious. Yet, the goals of agriculture and nutrition have often diverged. Following the Second World War, increasing food production was seen as fundamental to fighting hunger, reducing social inequities and lifting families out of poverty. Investments in agricultural research to develop high-yielding varieties of wheat and rice helped to double cereal yields in Asia and Latin America. This Green Revolution averted global food shortages and saved millions of lives. Part of its legacy however, has been a persistent emphasis on expanding production of a select few staple grains. This calories-first inheritance has limited the contribution of agriculture to meeting most national dietary recommendations that emphasize consumption of fruits, vegetables and pulses, as well as cereals. Reshaping modern agriculture and food systems to be more nutrition-sensitive has been only a secondary concern of most nutrition programmes and policies. Instead, efforts to strengthen primary health care, and reduce deficiencies of specific micronutrients through supplementation and fortification have been favoured. These efforts, and those of agriculture to generate an abundance of affordable food, have been enormously important for reducing both severe acute and chronic malnutrition. However, the global landscape of malnutrition has shifted in recent decades. Countries that have made impressive strides in reducing undernutrition (e.g. Brazil, China and Chile) have also experienced rapid increases in the prevalence of obesity and related chronic disease.4 Unfortunately, many countries now face a double burden of undernutrition and obesity as economic development, changing diet patterns, sedentary lifestyles and urban migration have outpaced efforts to develop infrastructure, strengthen institutions and expand provision of health services.5 More than ever, integrative solutions are needed that are able to combat malnutrition on multiple fronts, across the spectrum from deficiencies of energy and micronutrients to overconsumption, obesity and related diseases. The food and agriculture sectors are uniquely positioned to provide such solutions. The complexity of the diet-health nexus and an emphasis on the health impacts of specific dietary compounds rather than foods has made it difficult to communicate a consistent and clear message to guide the goals of food production. Yet, an increasing number of academics, health professionals and practitioners advocate that foods, rather than nutrients, should serve as the basis for dietary recommendations.6 From a food-based perspective, there is broad and consistent scientific evidence to support a simple dietary guideline for optimizing health: eat a variety of real foods; mostly plants.7 Agriculture is essential to meeting this simple directive. Yet, in many ways, our current systems of agriculture have not been designed for the production of a diversity of nutrient-dense foods. Just three food crops – rice, maize and wheat – provide nearly two-thirds of global dietary energy intake. The global supply of pulses, fruits and vegetables, the primary sources of diversity in most diets, is insufficient to meet recommended population-level intakes.8 At the same time, agriculture has increasingly become an engine not for producing food, but for generating animal feed, biofuels and industrial ingredients for processed food products (e.g. sugar-sweetened beverages, ready-to-eat meals and snacks).9 If the goals of agriculture are to be aligned with our aspirations for healthy diets, diversity must be prioritized alongside the critical goal of enhancing staple crop productivity. New investments in agricultural research, and perhaps more aptly, food systems research, are needed to develop technologies for production of pulses, fruits and vegetables at lower cost. Parallel efforts to strengthen the functioning of markets and adapt food value chains must accompany enhanced production efficiencies. These efforts are important for supporting stable incomes for farmers expanding the production of vegetables, pulses and fruits, while ensuring that the nutritional quality of these foods is not diminished after harvest. These investments and actions are only sensible if coupled with parallel investments elsewhere in the food system to increase demand for nutrient-dense foods.10 Evidence-based behaviour-change strategies are needed that reflect the enormously successful commercial marketing approaches used by the food and beverage industry to promote highly processed foods and beverages. Cultivating food environments that promote health is also essential. In some contexts, regulatory approaches may be appropriate – for example, taxation of sugar-sweetened beverages, mandatory front-of-pack labels on packaged food products or limits on marketing of certain foods to children.11 However, influencing behavioural cues by subtly altering the convenience and attractiveness of health-promoting pulses, vegetables and fruits in schools, markets, workplaces and in homes may also be effective without restricting choices.12 The public health and nutrition communities also need to more fully integrate food systems approaches into the training of health professionals, into the goals and designs of their respective programmes, as well as into policy advocacy efforts, as one strategy in an ever-evolving toolkit for addressing malnutrition. The complex nutritional challenges that we now face – reflected in the double burden of undernutrition and obesity– are daunting, but not insurmountable. These challenges defy solutions that rely on conventional sectoral approaches, but in doing so, invite new thinking that could afford multiple benefits. For example, there is enormous unrealized market potential in the production of pulses, fruits, vegetables and ancient grains that could contribute to new livelihood opportunities for millions of smallholder farmers.13 These same crops are essential for preventing undernutrition, obesity and diet-related disease that together are contributing to increase in health-related costs and lost productivity. Therefore, with consonant objectives, global health and food systems could help to restore the vitality of economies globally. Realigning the goals of agriculture to address human health by meeting dietary guidelines is only the most conspicuous of many possible pathways through which food systems can be leveraged to affect human health and nutrition. Food systems, for example, also have potential to affect food safety, exposure to infectious illness, food prices, household incomes and women’s access to productive resources – all of which are key mediators of nutrition and health.14 Since agriculture contributes up to one-third of global greenhouse gas emissions, new and improved climate-smart food production and processing systems could have a particularly positive impact on both the environment and the many human health and nutrition outcomes that otherwise would be negatively affected by extreme weather.15 It is our hope that the agriculture, nutrition and health communities can leverage the potential for shared solutions across sectors to confront the challenge of improving nutrition and health and ending global hunger while protecting the global ecosystem services on which food production depends.",https://doi.org/10.2471/blt.15.164509,

This element is an essential component of plant cells at the structural, genetic and metabolic levels, getting involved in many processes of plant growth and development which finally lead to yield as well as the quality of harvested organs (seeds or shoot biomass). While soil N availability can be enhanced in agricultural areas through fertilizers supply, under natural conditions mineral N generally limits plant growth because of spatial and temporal fluctuations in its availability in the soil. Moreover, in the context of climate change, plants will experience more abiotic stresses, including those impacting water availability (drought, flooding), extreme temperatures (chilling, heat), presence of heavy metals, nutrients availability, and soil structure, which can have dramatic consequences on yield and quality, as they directly or indirectly modify plant N acquisition and utilization. Among plants species, legumes have the capacity to acquire soil N via roots and, in addition atmospheric dinitrogen through symbiosis with bacteria. While in legumes both these N retrieval ways interact (the interaction being mediated by soil nitrate availability), they also complement for an optimum N nutrition. However, even in legumes, because of the high energy cost of N2 fixation (Voisin et al., 2003b) and the high sensitivity of nodules to environmental factors (Salon et al., 2001; Serraj et al., 1999), N acquisition is also very frequently spatially and temporally limited. Hence, details concerning the differences between legumes and non-legume plants can set the foundation for the understanding of the stress impacts on plants. One of the biggest challenge for European agronomy in the next years will be to cope with the necessary reduction/optimization of fertilizer use in order to minimize agricultural detrimental impacts on the environment (reducing fossil use energy and greenhouse gas emissions, maintaining/enhancing biodiversity through pesticides/herbicide use reduction) while producing more feed/food for the ever growing population. One way to solve this dilemma consists in the identification/selection of crops having enhanced N use efficiency",https://www.intechopen.com/citation-pdf-url/18399,

During the last decades an increasing area of drained peatlands has been rewetted. Especially in Germany, rewetting is the principal treatment on cutover sites when peat extraction is finished. The objectives are bog restoration and the reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The first sites were rewetted in the 1980s. Thus, there is a good opportunity to study long-term effects of rewetting on greenhouse gas exchange, which has not been done so far on temperate cutover peatlands. Moreover, Sphagnum cultivating may become a new way to use cutover peatlands and agriculturally used peatlands as it permits the economical use of bogs under wet conditions. The climate impact of such measures has not been studied yet. We conducted a field study on the exchange of carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide at three rewetted sites with a gradient from dry to wet conditions and at a Sphagnum cultivation site in NW Germany over the course of more than 2 years. Gas fluxes were measured using transparent and opaque closed chambers. The ecosystem respiration (CO2) and the net ecosystem exchange (CO2) were modelled at a high temporal resolution. Measured and modelled values fit very well together. Annually cumulated gas flux rates, net ecosystem carbon balances (NECB) and global warming potential (GWP) balances were determined. The annual net ecosystem exchange (CO2) varied strongly at the rewetted sites (from −201.7 ± 126.8 to 29.7± 112.7g CO2-C m−2 a−1) due to differing weather conditions, water levels and vegetation. The Sphagnum cultivation site was a sink of CO2 (−118.8 ± 48.1 and −78.6 ± 39.8 g CO2-C m−2 a−1). The annual CH4 balances ranged between 16.2 ± 2.2 and 24.2 ± 5.0g CH4-C m−2 a−1 at two inundated sites, while one rewetted site with a comparatively low water level and the Sphagnum farming site show CH4 fluxes close to 0. The net N2O fluxes were low and not significantly different between the four sites. The annual NECB was between −185.5 ± 126.9 and 49.9 ± 112.8 g CO2-C m−2 a−1 at the rewetted sites and −115.8 ± 48.1 and −77 ± 39.8 g CO2-C m−2 a−1 at the Sphagnum cultivating site. The annual GWP100 balances ranged from −280.5 ± 465.2 to 644.5 ± 413.6 g CO2-eq. m−2 a−1 at the rewetted sites. In contrast, the Sphagnum farming site had a cooling impact on the climate in both years (−356.8 ± 176.5 and −234.9 ± 145.9 g CO2-C m−2 a−1). If the carbon exported through the harvest of the Sphagnum biomass and the additional CO2 emission from the decay of the organic material is considered, the NECB and GWP100 balances are near neutral. Peat mining sites are likely to become net carbon sinks and a peat accumulating (""growing"") peatland within 30 years of rewetting, but the GWP100 balance may still be positive. A recommended measure for rewetting is to achieve a water level of a few centimetres below ground. Sphagnum farming is a climate-friendly alternative to conventional commercial use of bogs. A year-round constant water level of a few centimetres below ground level should be maintained.",https://bg.copernicus.org/articles/12/2101/2015/bg-12-2101-2015.pdf,

Since most suitable lands worldwide have been cultivated, there is a growing pressure to increase yields on existing agricultural lands. In tropical and subtropical regions, multicropping is widely used to increase food production, but regional-to-global information related to multicropping practices is poor. The high temporal resolution and moderate spatial resolution of the MODIS sensors provide an ideal source of information for characterizing cropping practices over large areas. Relative to studies that document agricultural extensification, however, systematic assessment of agricultural intensification via multicropping has received relatively little attention. The goal of this work was to help close this information gap by developing methods that use multitemporal remote sensing to map multicropping systems in Asia. Image time-series analysis is especially challenging in this part of the world because atmospheric conditions including clouds and aerosols lead to high frequencies of missing or low-quality observations, especially during the Asian Monsoon. The methodology that we developed builds upon the algorithm used to produce the MODIS Land Cover Dynamics product (MCD12Q2), but uses an improved methodology optimized for crops. We assessed our results at the aggregate scale using state, district, and provincial level inventory statistics reporting total cropped and harvested areas, and at the field scale using survey results for 191 field sites in Bangladesh. While the algorithm highlighted the dominant continental-scale patterns in agricultural practices throughout Asia, and produced reasonable estimates of state and provincial level total harvested areas, field-scale assessment revealed significant challenges in mapping high cropping intensity due to abundant missing data.",http://oar.icrisat.org/9185/1/Mapping%20Asian%20Cropping%20Intensity%20With%20MODIS.pdf,

Producing biomass for bioenergy from low‐input perennial species mixtures on marginal land has the potential to support biodiversity and soil carbon sequestration in synergy with greenhouse gas mitigation. We compared biomass production in species‐rich mixtures of perennial grasses, legumes and forbs with pure‐stand grasses and relatively species‐poor mixtures under different nitrogen fertilization regimes. Field experiments were performed on different types of marginal land, that is agricultural field margins and land with poor soil fertility, at four sites in southernmost and western Sweden. Biomass production was measured for three years in perennial grasses grown as pure stands, in legume‐grass mixtures, and legume‐grass‐forb mixtures across a species richness gradient. In unfertilized species‐rich mixtures, average biomass yields per experimental site and year were in the range from 3 to 9 metric ton DM ha−1 yr−1. While the most productive pure‐stand grasses fertilized with 60–120 kg N ha−1 yr−1 often produced higher biomass yields than unfertilized mixtures, these differences were generally smaller than the variations between years and sites. Calculations of climate impact using the harvested biomass for conversion to biogas as vehicle fuel showed that the average greenhouse gas emissions per energy unit were about 50% lower in unfertilized systems than in treatments fertilized with 100–120 kg N ha−1 yr−1. Our findings thereby show that unfertilized species‐rich perennial plant mixtures on marginal land provide resource‐efficient biomass production and contribute to the mitigation of climate change.

Therefore, there is an incentive to apply it in other important domains such as agriculture. Fertilizers, electricity, chemicals, human labor, and water are the components of total energy consumption in agriculture. Yield estimates are critical for food security, crop management, irrigation scheduling, and estimating labor requirements for harvesting and storage. Therefore, estimating product yield can reduce energy consumption. Two deep learning models, Long Short-Term Memory and Gated Recurrent Units, have been developed for the analysis of time-series data such as agricultural datasets. In this paper, the capabilities of these models and their extensions, called Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory and Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Units, to predict end-of-season yields are investigated. The models use historical data, including climate data, irrigation scheduling, and soil water content, to estimate end-of-season yield. The application of this technique was tested for tomato and potato yields at a site in Portugal. The Bidirectional Long Short-Term memory outperformed the Gated Recurrent Units network, the Long Short-Term Memory, and the Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Units network on the validation dataset. The model was able to capture the nonlinear relationship between irrigation amount, climate data, and soil water content and predict yield with an MSE of 0.017 to 0.039. The performance of the Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory in the test was compared with the most commonly used deep learning method, the Convolutional Neural Network, and machine learning methods including a Multi-Layer Perceptrons model and Random Forest Regression. The Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory outperformed the other models with an R2 score between 0.97 and 0.99. The results show that analyzing agricultural data with the Long Short-Term Memory model improves the performance of the model in terms of accuracy. The Convolutional Neural Network model achieved the second-best performance. Therefore, the deep learning model has a remarkable ability to predict the yield at the end of the season.",https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/14/11/3004/pdf?version=1621845293,

New agricultural research is needed to provide additional information to farmers, policy makers and other decision makers on how to accomplish sustainable agriculture over the wide variations in climate change around the world. Therefore many researchers have over the years shown interest in finding ways to estimate the yield of crops before harvest.

These two concurring adverse environmental conditions will surely have a detrimental effect on crop performance and productivity that will be particularly severe on woody crops such as citrus, olive and grapevine that define the backbone of traditional Mediterranean agriculture. These woody species have been traditionally selected for traits such as improved fruit yield and quality or alteration in harvesting periods, leaving out traits related to plant field performance. This is currently a crucial aspect due to the progressive and imminent effects of global climate change. Although complete genome sequence exists for sweet orange (Citrus sinensis) and clementine (Citrus clementina), olive tree (Olea europaea) and grapevine (Vitis vinifera), the development of biotechnological tools to improve stress tolerance still relies on the study of the available genetic resources including interspecific hybrids, naturally occurring (or induced) polyploids and wild relatives under field conditions. To this respect, post-genomic era studies including transcriptomics, metabolomics and proteomics provide a wide and unbiased view of plant physiology and biochemistry under adverse environmental conditions that, along with high-throughput phenotyping, could contribute to the characterization of plant genotypes exhibiting physiological and/or genetic traits that are correlated to abiotic stress tolerance. The ultimate goal of precision agriculture is to improve crop productivity, in terms of yield and quality, making a sustainable use of land and water resources under adverse environmental conditions using all available biotechnological tools and high-throughput phenotyping.

Field-scale models have increased our understanding of rice yield and its estimation under theoretical environmental conditions. However, they offer little information on spatial variability effects on farm-scale yield. Remote Sensing (RS) is a useful tool to upscale yield estimates from farm scales to regional levels. Much research used RS with rice models for reliable yield estimation. As several countries start to operationalize rice monitoring systems, it is needed to synthesize current literature to identify knowledge gaps, to improve estimation accuracies, and to optimize processing. This paper critically reviewed significant developments in using geospatial methods, imagery, and quantitative models to estimate rice yield. First, essential characteristics of rice were discussed as detected by optical and radar sensors, band selection, sensor configuration, spatial resolution, mapping methods, and biophysical variables of rice derivable from RS data. Second, various empirical, process-based, and semi-empirical models that used RS data for spatial estimation of yield were critically assessed – discussing how major types of models, RS platforms, data assimilation algorithms, canopy state variables, and RS variables can be integrated for yield estimation. Lastly, to overcome current constraints and to improve accuracies, several possibilities were suggested – adding new modeling modules, using alternative canopy variables, and adopting novel modeling approaches. As rice yields are expected to decrease due to global warming, geospatial rice yield estimation techniques are indispensable tools for climate change assessments. Future studies should focus on resolving the current limitations of estimation by precise delineation of rice cultivars, by incorporating dynamic harvesting indices based on climatic drivers, using innovative modeling approaches with machine learning.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/10095020.2021.1936656?needAccess=true,

The aim of the study was to evaluate the spatial differentiation of thermal resources in Poland and their variability during a period of changing thermal conditions in Europe. Since the variability of thermal conditions is of paramount importance for perennial crops, the study focused on apple, plum, and cherry orchard regions in Poland. The analysis was conducted for the period of 1951–2010 using air temperature daily data. Thermal resources have been defined using the growing degree days (GDD) index calculated independently for the whole year and during in frost-free season for three air temperature thresholds: 0, 5, and 10 °C, which determine the non-winter period, growing season, and the period of full plant growth, respectively. In addition, due to the high significance for perennials in particular, the incidence and intensity of frost during flowering were calculated. In this study, a detailed analysis of the spatial differentiation of thermal resources was first performed, followed by an evaluation of long-term variability and associated change patterns. The obtained results confirmed an increase in thermal resources in Poland as a consequence of the lengthening of the growing season.

Treatment of bioenergy as ‘low carbon’ or carbon neutral often assumes fuels are agricultural or forestry residues that will decompose and emit CO2 if not burned for energy. However, for ‘low carbon’ assumptions about residues to be reasonable, two conditions must be met: biomass must genuinely be material left over from some other process; and cumulative net emissions, the additional CO2 emitted by burning biomass compared to its alternative fate, must be low or negligible in a timeframe meaningful for climate mitigation. This study assesses biomass use and net emissions from the US bioenergy and wood pellet manufacturing sectors. It defines the ratio of cumulative net emissions to combustion, manufacturing and transport emissions as the net emissions impact (NEI), and evaluates the NEI at year 10 and beyond for a variety of scenarios. The analysis indicates the US industrial bioenergy sector mostly burns black liquor and has an NEI of 20% at year 10, while the NEI for plants burning forest residues ranges from 41%–95%. Wood pellets have a NEI of 55%–79% at year 10, with net CO2 emissions of 14–20 tonnes for every tonne of pellets; by year 40, the NEI is 26%–54%. Net emissions may be ten times higher at year 40 if whole trees are harvested for feedstock. Projected global pellet use would generate around 1% of world bioenergy with cumulative net emissions of 2 Gt of CO2 by 2050. Using the NEI to weight biogenic CO2 for inclusion in carbon trading programs and to qualify bioenergy for renewable energy subsidies would reduce emissions more effectively than the current assumption of carbon neutrality.",https://doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/aaac88,

Nutrient cycling incorporates the reuse of agricultural, industrial and municipal organic residues that, misleadingly, are often referred to as ‘wastes’. The present review disentangles the processes underlying the cycling of nutrients to better understand which soil properties determine the performance of that function. Four processes are identified (i) the capacity to receive nutrients, (ii) the capacity to make and keep nutrients available to crops, (iii) the capacity to support the uptake of nutrients by crops and (iv) the capacity to support their successful removal in harvested crop. Soil properties matter but it is imperative that, as constituents of ‘soil quality’, they should be evaluated in the context of management options and climate and not as ends in their own right. The effect of a soil property may vary depending on the prevailing climatic and hydrologic conditions and on other soil properties. We recognize that individual soil properties may be enhancing one of the processes underlying the cycling of nutrients but simultaneously weakening others. Competing demands on soil properties are even more obvious when considering other soil functions such as primary production, purification and flow regulation of water, climate modification and habitat provision, as shown by examples. Consequently, evaluations of soil properties and management actions need to be site‐specific, taking account of local aspects of their suitability and potential challenges.",https://doi.org/10.1111/sum.12288,

Simultaneously farmers and agricultural organizations are increasingly collecting observational data about in situ crop performance. Agriculture thus needs new tools to cope with changing environmental conditions and to take advantage of these data. Data mining techniques make it possible to extract embedded knowledge associated with farmer experiences from these large observational datasets in order to identify best practices for adapting to climate variability. We introduce new approaches through a case study on irrigated and rainfed rice in Colombia. Preexisting observational datasets of commercial harvest records were combined with in situ daily weather series. Using Conditional Inference Forest and clustering techniques, we assessed the relationships between climatic factors and crop yield variability at the local scale for specific cultivars and growth stages. The analysis showed clear relationships in the various location-cultivar combinations, with climatic factors explaining 6 to 46% of spatiotemporal variability in yield, and with crop responses to weather being non-linear and cultivar-specific. Climatic factors affected cultivars differently during each stage of development. For instance, one cultivar was affected by high nighttime temperatures in the reproductive stage but responded positively to accumulated solar radiation during the ripening stage. Another was affected by high nighttime temperatures during both the vegetative and reproductive stages. Clustering of the weather patterns corresponding to individual cropping events revealed different groups of weather patterns for irrigated and rainfed systems with contrasting yield levels. Best-suited cultivars were identified for some weather patterns, making weather-site-specific recommendations possible. This study illustrates the potential of data mining for adding value to existing observational data in agriculture by allowing embedded knowledge to be quickly leveraged. It generates site-specific information on cultivar response to climatic factors and supports on-farm management decisions for adaptation to climate variability.",https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0161620&type=printable,

However, farming has been constrained by the mountainous topography and rapid changes in environmental variabilities. With climate change, agricultural production and food security is likely to face one of the biggest challenges of the twenty-first century. The country has already been experiencing some impacts of climate change, such as crop loss to unusual outbreaks of diseases and pests, erratic rainfalls, windstorms, hail storms, droughts, flash floods and landslides annually.ResultsIn 1996, rice farmers in high-altitude areas were devastated with 80–90% crop loss to blast disease. Turcicum leaf blight of maize in 2007 damaged more than 50% of the farmers’ harvest. Also, in 2008, a severe windstorm flattened all maize crops belonging to hundreds of households. These were some gruesome reminders of the impacts of climate change that continues to threaten farming in Bhutan. The current agricultural practices are highly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change due to their total dependence on monsoon rains and shorter growing periods. The mountainous topography makes the country more vulnerable due to large climatic swings in the mountainous ecosystem. Field evidences have also shown that shifts in cropping pattern are taking place across agroecologies, thus indicating that farming in Bhutan is quite stressed. Further, climate modelling outputs have projected that there is likely to be marked changes in the pattern of precipitation and upward trend in temperatures.ConclusionIn the mountainous topography of Bhutan, food production is a challenge and the impacts of climate change are likely to add to the burdens of farming. Since climate change impacts are already being felt, it is of paramount importance to focus on research works to understand and mitigate the impacts. The information generated from this study could contribute to both short- and long-term planning and policy development works related to food security and climate change in the near future.",https://agricultureandfoodsecurity.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s40066-018-0229-6,

The oceans are the world’s most important sources of biological activity, water, biodiversity, and biomass production. They supply food, oxygen, and other natural products critical for human existence, and interactions between the oceans and atmosphere shape our climate and weather. Today, we recognize the oceans for all these attributes and also for their marvelous, incredible, and almost infinite diversity of life forms and life processes, as well as the extraordinary potential for many of those life forms, biological and physical processes, and other resources to be harnessed for human welfare. We are just beginning to understand the numerous and complex ways in which humans can affect the oceans, and the oceans, in turn, can affect human health, including the discovery of new pharmaceuticals to fight human illnesses. Although not truly an island, the United States is bordered on all sides by seas, and the lands immediately adjacent to the coast annually contribute over $1 trillion to the U.S. economy. In addition, our coastal waters provide invaluable waste processing and other ecologic services for free. Approximately 25% of the country’s land area lies within coastal counties, which provide homes and workplaces for > 50% of our population. In addition, ocean-based tourism is the fastest growing component of the coastal economy, with hundreds of millions of Americans and international guests visiting our coasts annually. Not surprisingly, coastal population densities are several times higher than in the rest of the nation, and coastal sprawl is consuming land at ≥ 3 times the rate of population growth. These trends are projected to continue and may accelerate, resulting in permanent alterations to a large portion of the coastal landscape and potentially serious impacts on marine ecosystems and public health. Estuaries—those places where freshwater rivers meet and mix with the saltwater of the ocean—are dynamic environments renowned for their ecologic complexity, biological productivity, and seafood harvests and for the critical nursery habitat they provide for many ecologically and economically important species. Linking the land to the sea, the shallow tidal creeks and embayments along the shores of larger estuaries are the first zone of impact for many of the chemical and microbial pollutants washed or released into estuaries. As nurseries for the early and generally most sensitive life-history stages of many species of fish and invertebrates, these areas may provide early warnings of ensuing harm to the environment and to humans. In addition, the continental shelf and even the open ocean show increasing evidence of human-derived pollutants, such as occurrences of pathogens and persistent organic pollutants in offshore marine mammals. Estuarine and coastal processes are increasingly being affected by humans, with consequent impacts on coastal ecosystems and the humans who live, work, and play there. Principal sources of pollution are urban and agricultural runoff, municipal sewage discharges, atmospheric deposition of airborne pollutants, and industrial wastewater. Other causes of degradation include shoreline modification, overfishing, introduction of invasive species, and high-density recreational use. Increasing incidences of beach closures, fish and shellfish consumption advisories, harmful algal blooms, and occurrence of toxic chemicals and pathogenic microorganisms in coastal waters, sediments, and biota are indicative of the extent of the problem. Changes in marine ecosystems due to global warming and other stressors also pose increased threats to human health from microbial agents transmitted via water, food, or other vectors, or which may be harbored in animal reservoirs. The safety and economic risks of extreme weather events, climate change, and rising sea levels to those who live on or visit our coasts are reasonably well known. However, while cases of human illness linked directly or indirectly to stressed estuarine and coastal environments are being documented with increasing frequency, the risks to human health from continued and expanded impairment of coastal and ocean environments remain very poorly understood. Globally, nontraumatic human illnesses documented in relation to coastal processes typically are associated with a) consumption of pathogencontaminated or chemically contaminated seafood; b) spread of human pathogens (e.g., cholera) via the release of poorly treated or untreated sewage into coastal waters; c) exposure to toxins from harmful algae; and d) effects of weather and climate on the rates and means of transmission and severity of infectious diseases. Other associations are more elusive, probably because we have not looked in the right places using the right technologies. Existing national and regional monitoring and assessment programs have focused on the measurement of persistent chemicals, particularly in deeper estuarine sediments. Much more attention should be paid to assessing known or potential human pathogens and contaminants and emerging contaminants of concern such as newly registered pesticides, pharmaceuticals, and fire retardants in shallow estuarine and marine waters, coastal retention ponds, continental shelf environments, and the open ocean. New approaches and collaborations are required if we are to understand and resolve the large-scale environmental and public health problems facing the United States’ predominantly coastal population. As the U.S. Commission on Ocean Policy (2004) stated in its preliminary report, “Significant investment must be put into developing a coordinated national research effort to better understand the links between the oceans and human health ....” The interdisciplinary Oceans and Human Health (OHH) initiatives now being undertaken by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and jointly by the National Science Foundation and National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences provide the first steps toward a coordinated effort to transcend traditional disciplines and boundaries and focus a broad array of scientific intellect on developing regional and national solutions to environmental and public health issues of increasing complexity involving cumulative impacts from multiple stressors. Deriving such solutions will require a sustained and concentrated effort of scientific talent from multiple disciplines and institutions, development of new technologies and new understanding of ecosystem dynamics, and effective transfer of critical information to natural resource and public health managers and to the public at large. These new OHH initiatives should help",https://doi.org/10.1289/ehp.112-a455,

Sunlight is essential for growth and productivity of photosynthetic organisms. However, exposure to an excessive amount of light adversely affects fitness due to photooxidative damage to the photosynthetic machinery, primarily to the reaction center of the oxygen-evolving photosystem II (PSII). Photosynthetic organisms have evolved diverse photoprotective and adaptive strategies to avoid, alleviate, and repair PSII damage caused by high-irradiance or fluctuating light. Rapid and harmless dissipation of excess absorbed light within antenna as heat, which is measured by chlorophyll fluorescence as non-photochemical quenching (NPQ), constitutes one of the most efficient protective strategies. In parallel, an elaborate repair system represents another efficient strategy to maintain PSII reaction centers in active states. This article reviews both the reaction center-based strategy for robust repair of photodamaged PSII and the antenna-based strategy for swift control of PSII light-harvesting (NPQ). We discuss evolutionarily and mechanistically diverse strategies used by photosynthetic organisms to maintain PSII function for growth and productivity under static high-irradiance light or fluctuating light environments. Knowledge of mechanisms underlying PSII maintenance would facilitate bioengineering photosynthesis to enhance agricultural productivity and sustainability to feed a growing world population amidst climate change.",https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpls.2019.00975/pdf,

In this context, we introduce the use of Sentinel-2 (S2) imagery, with a medium spatial, spectral and temporal resolutions, to estimate rice crop yields in Nepal as a case study. Firstly, we build a new large-scale rice crop database (RicePAL) composed by multi-temporal S2 and climate/soil data from the Terai districts of Nepal. Secondly, we propose a novel 3D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) adapted to these intrinsic data constraints for the accurate rice crop yield estimation.

These interactions may be negative such as the host-pathogen interactions leading to the disease development in plants or positive likes the interaction of the plants with the beneficial soil microbiota for stimulating the plant growth, conferring biotic, and abiotic stress tolerance in plants and helping the plants for the revitalization of contaminated and degraded soils (Abhilash et al., 2012). Apart from that, the beneficial microorganisms influence the resource allocation between root and shoot, biodiversity and also mediate the above-ground below ground interactions with herbivores and other natural enemies of the plants. Moreover, such dialogues between plant and microbes can modify the chemical, physical, and biochemical properties of the soil. The root exudate secreted by the plant allocates carbon and nutrients to the soil in the form of low molecular weight sugars, amino acids, and organic acids, polymerized sugars (e.g., mucilage), root border cells and dead root cap cells. Plant secretes phytosiderophores that help in sequestration of metallic micronutrients from the soil. Root exudates also contains secondary metabolites which help in the communication of plant and microbes. However, these interactions are intriguingly complex and dynamic and quite difficult to decipher as they takes places at different interfaces such as rhizosphere, phyllosphere, and endosphere. Therefore, a deep understanding of the interwoven processes taking place at the above interfaces is essential for disentangling the contribution of the each and every player for the ecosystem wellbeing. Thus, it is imperative to understand the key processes of the plant-microbe interactions in relation to assessing the contribution of the plant associated microorganisms to sustainable agriculture, ecosystem restoration, biomass and bioenergy production and mitigating the adverse impacts of climate change (Saleem and Moe, 2014). In this context, the book “Principles of Plant-Microbe Interactions: Microbes for Sustainable Agriculture,” edited by Ben Lugtenberg (2015) is a topical and timely contribution on plant-microbe interactions and offers a great hope for harnessing such beneficial interactions for making agriculture as a sustainable enterprise. Though literature provides ample information on plant-microbe interactions, the current book is first of its kind to discuss not only the interactions of microbes with plants but also the interactions of other important but often ignored players such as nematodes, insects, and pests. The book also discusses various ecological, economic and social aspects related to the plant-microbe based packages right from exploiting the symbiotic relationship to the development of genetically modified organisms for enhancing the sustainability of agriculture. The editor did his level best to incorporating the views of leading scientists and industrial professionals working in the concerned area to give a complete package to students, teachers, academicians, policy makers, young entrepreneurs, biotech, and food industry specialists and policy makers for understanding the plant-microbe interactions and successful exploitation for the benefit of the society. Moreover, the simple and lucid presentation of the crosstalk between microbes and the plants taking place at different interface is good enough to quenches the thirst of the readers from basic to applied and advanced molecular developments in the area. The editor meticulously divided the book into eight parts for detailing the fundaments of plant-microbe interactions to the application level such as (i) the elucidation of the microbial diversity associated with the plant system and its specific role (ii) the diversity of the phytopathogens, pests mediated crop damage, plant defense, and dilemma about the transgenic crops in public (iii) role of biocontrol agents and transgenics in plant disease resistance and post-harvest loss (vi) mechanism of different plant growth promoting microorganism and arbuscular mycorrhizae in host plant nutrients, water use efficiency and rhizoremediation (v) merit and the challenges in recent techniques like culture independent molecular tools and confocal microscopy for unraveling the rhizosphere microbiome and its interaction with the host plant (vi) the commercialization of microbial inoculum for the plant growth and disease control (vii) harnessing of plant-microbe interactions as a low-input biotechnology and finally (viii) manipulating the plant-microbe interactions for human wellbeing. The book starts with the fundamentals of the plant-microbe interactions by unraveling the rhizospheric, phyllospheric, and endospheric microbial world associated with the plant system. The book helps in exploring the diverse microbial partners, its importance's and mechanisms of the actions for proper understanding of the topic. It also elucidates the structural and functional details of microbial cell surfaces and its role in exchanging the signals from the exterior to the intracellular milieu. Interestingly, the book also exploring the role of myriad phytopathogens such as bacteria, fungi, nematodes, viruses, and pests its symptomatology, infections mechanisms along with plant immune response to infections and disease control mediated by the biocontrol agents. Apart from the biocontrol activity, the editor has also made an attempt to address the role of the plant associated microbiome for solubilizing the essential nutrients in soil and also for promoting the plant growth and yields even under adverse environmental conditions. The book also reminds that certain modifications in the microbial traits and rhizosphere environment will enhance the productivity of the agroecosystems. Importantly, the students and restoration workers will get in depth knowledge about various strategies for reshaping the rhizosphere microbiome. Similarly, transferring the genetic machinery of the nitrogen fixation in to non-legume plants also provides new vistas in sustainable agriculture. The book also unveil the concepts and issues related with the formulation, efficacy testing based on the European Plant Protection Organization, process of registration, and the global commercialization of the microbial inoculums in detail. The major global producers of the microbial inoculums are also detailed in this book. Although microbes like Pseudomonas sp., Bacillus sp., and Trichoderma sp. are the most suitable bio-inoculants, there are always outstanding concerns regarding the shell-life and field performance of these inoculums. Interestingly, the Editor has paid attention to detail the next generation ideal bioinoculants with the concepts of the enhanced stability, carrier suitability, spore forming capability, better inoculation strategies, seed–soil inoculation, microbial inoculants consortium application including bacteria, and fungi. It has been generally postulated that under changing climatic conditions, the increasing atmospheric CO2 will have a fertilization effect on plants and will increase the allocation of nutrients in above- and belowground parts. Hence, it is unclear that how such change will go to affect the plant-microbe interactions at ecosystem level (Abhilash and Dubey, 2014). Although such changing conditions will have a significant impact on plant-microbe interactions, the present book does not shed light on this important issue. Similarly, the exploitation of plant-microbe interactions for the clean-up of contaminated soils has been presented in accordance to the clean-up of organic pollutants with little emphasis on heavy metal and mixed pollutants (organic and inorganic) contaminated soil. Furthermore, in a time when next generation sequencing technologies have been completely revolutionized the microbial community analysis, the current book describes the microbial community analysis mainly on the basis of Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis. Nevertheless, we enjoyed reading this book as the editor tried to cover almost all fundamental and applied aspects of the plant-microbe interactions. As a final word, the book can be described as a book for all.",https://doi.org/10.3389/fpls.2015.00986,

Here we report the influence of drought on alfalfa yields and nutritional composition, based on artificially induced drought conditions during two field experiments. Two types of alfalfa cultivars were compared, Gold Queen and Suntory. The severity and timing of drought periods were varied, and the crop was harvested either early during flowering, or late at full bloom. The obtained dry mass yields of Gold Queen were higher than Suntory, and the first was also more resistant to drought. Early harvest resulted in higher yields. Decreases in yields due to water shortage were observed with both cultivars, and the fraction of crude protein (CP) decreased as a result of drought stress; this fraction was higher in Gold Queen than in Suntory and higher in early harvest compared to late harvest. Severe drought late in spring had the highest effect on CP content. The fraction of fibre, split up into neutral detergent fibre (NDF) and acid detergent fibre (ADF) increased as a result of drought and was lower in early compared to late harvested plants. Suntory alfalfa produced higher fibre fractions than Gold Queen. The fraction of water-soluble carbohydrates (WSC) was least affected by drought. It was consistently higher in Gold Queen compared to Suntory alfalfa, and late harvest resulted in higher WSC content. In combination, these results suggest that the nutritive value of alfalfa will likely decrease after a period of drought. These effects can be partly overcome by choosing the Gold Queen cultivar over Suntory, by targeted irrigation, in particular in late spring, and by harvesting at an earlier time.",https://bmcplantbiol.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s12870-017-1226-9,

Agricultural and forestry biomass residues form an inexpensive bioenergy feedstock with low greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, if harvested sustainably. We analysed quantities of biomass residues supplied for energy and their sensitivities in harmonised bioenergy demand scenarios across eight integrated assessment models (IAMs) and compared them with literature-estimated residue availability. IAM results vary substantially, at both global and regional scales, but suggest that residues could meet 7–50% of bioenergy demand towards 2050, and 2–30% towards 2100, in a scenario with 300 EJ/year of exogenous bioenergy demand towards 2100. When considering mean literature-estimated availability, residues could provide around 55 EJ/year by 2050. Inter-model differences primarily arise from model structure, assumptions, and the representation of agriculture and forestry. Despite these differences, drivers of residues supplied and underlying cost dynamics are largely similar across models. Higher bioenergy demand or biomass prices increase the quantity of residues supplied for energy, though their effects level off as residues become depleted. GHG emission pricing and land protection can increase the costs of using land for lignocellulosic bioenergy crop cultivation, which increases residue use at the expense of lignocellulosic bioenergy crops. In most IAMs and scenarios, supplied residues in 2050 are within literature-estimated residue availability, but outliers and sustainability concerns warrant further exploration. We conclude that residues can cost-competitively play an important role in the twenty-first century bioenergy supply, though uncertainties remain concerning (regional) forestry and agricultural production and resulting residue supply potentials.",https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10584-019-02539-x.pdf,

The emissions of nitrous oxide (N2O) and leaching of nitrate (NO3) from agricultural cropping systems have considerable negative impacts on climate and the environment. Although these environmental burdens are less per unit area in organic than in non-organic production on average, they are roughly similar per unit of product. If organic farming is to maintain its goal of being environmentally friendly, these loadings must be addressed. We discuss the impact of possible drivers of N2O emissions and NO3 leaching within organic arable farming practice under European climatic conditions, and potential strategies to reduce these. Organic arable crop rotations are generally diverse with the frequent use of legumes, intercropping and organic fertilisers. The soil organic matter content and the share of active organic matter, soil structure, microbial and faunal activity are higher in such diverse rotations, and the yields are lower, than in non-organic arable cropping systems based on less diverse systems and inorganic fertilisers. Soil mineral nitrogen (SMN), N2O emissions and NO3 leaching are low under growing crops, but there is the potential for SMN accumulation and losses after crop termination, harvest or senescence. The risk of high N2O fluxes increases when large amounts of herbage or organic fertilisers with readily available nitrogen (N) and degradable carbon are incorporated into the soil or left on the surface. Freezing/thawing, drying/rewetting, compacted and/or wet soil and mechanical mixing of crop residues into the soil further enhance the risk of high N2O fluxes. N derived from soil organic matter (background emissions) does, however, seem to be the most important driver for N2O emission from organic arable crop rotations, and the correlation between yearly total N-input and N2O emissions is weak. Incorporation of N-rich plant residues or mechanical weeding followed by bare fallow conditions increases the risk of NO3 leaching. In contrast, strategic use of deep-rooted crops with long growing seasons or effective cover crops in the rotation reduces NO3 leaching risk. Enhanced recycling of herbage from green manures, crop residues and cover crops through biogas or composting may increase N efficiency and reduce N2O emissions and NO3 leaching. Mixtures of legumes (e.g. clover or vetch) and non-legumes (e.g. grasses or Brassica species) are as efficient cover crops for reducing NO3 leaching as monocultures of non-legume species. Continued regular use of cover crops has the potential to reduce NO3 leaching and enhance soil organic matter but may enhance N2O emissions. There is a need to optimise the use of crops and cover crops to enhance the synchrony of mineralisation with crop N uptake to enhance crop productivity, and this will concurrently reduce the long-term risks of NO3 leaching and N2O emissions.",https://bg.copernicus.org/articles/16/2795/2019/bg-16-2795-2019.pdf,

Using a unique longitudinal micro-level data set of Swiss apple orchards that include information on both the quantity produced as well as the quality, we show that the latter can have an even larger effect on farm revenue. Ignoring the quality of the harvested product substantially biases the impact of weather extremes on agricultural income and the potential effects of climate change. Our quality measure is the orchard-year specific price shock. If an orchard gets a lower price for its specific apple variety compared to previous years and compared to other orchards in the same year, we observe the market’s valuation of its inferior quality accounting for overall price movements (other orchards growing same variety that year) as well as orchard specific factors (orchard fixed effects).

Drought stress, in combination with century-long socio-political issues such as unequal social structure, gender discrimination, and marginalization of poor and disadvantaged groups have made smallholders more vulnerable in society. Climate changes are exacerbating issues within an already vulnerable society. Therefore, a review study on the impact of drought on the rain-fed hill farming system, and the potential adaptation measures, was carried out in the mid-hill region of western Nepal. Both agricultural impacts such as depletion of traditional varieties of crops, crop-specific diseases, low production, lack of water for irrigation; and non-agricultural impacts such as changing rural livelihood patterns, and social conflict due to agriculture and water issues were identified as major impacts. Some of the agricultural adaptation measures viz. the promotion of climate smart agriculture practices, crop diversification, and agroforestry practices seem to have been more effective in the region. At the same time, small-scale structural water harvesting measures, for instance, rainwater harvesting, conservation ponds, and irrigation channels, drip water irrigation, and an early warning system for drought events could also be an advantage in this context. Nonetheless, there are several adaptation barriers including ecological and physical constraints, human and information resource-shortages, and social barriers to adaptation. Therefore, local site-specific adaptation measures should be developed, and implemented, to increase the adaptive capacity of smallholders, and enhance the farming system in the face of the climate-induced drought scenario.",https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3298/5/9/101/pdf?version=1535959733,

In 2050, with changes in climate and increases in population, field bioenergy production potential could be 101–110 EJ, 57–61 EJ and 44–47 EJ, following equivalent diets. Of the potential field bioenergy production, 39–42 EJ now and 38–41 EJ in 2050 would derive from crop residues.

If crop production technology was improved in areas where environmental conditions allow more efficient food production, such as the former Soviet Union, large areas in Europe could also produce bioenergy in set aside fields. The realistic potential and sustainability of field bioenergy production are discussed.",https://journal.fi/afs/article/download/5950/5148,

Quinoa (Chenopodium quinoa Willd.) has the potential to provide a drought tolerant, nutritious alternative to maize. We evaluated 11 diverse varieties of quinoa for their yield and agronomic performance at two locations, Bunda and Bembeke, in Malawi. The varieties originated from Ecuador, Chile and Bolivia in South America; the United States and Canada in North America; and, Denmark in Europe, and were chosen based on their variation in morphological and agronomic traits, and their potential for adaptation to the climate of Malawi. Plant height, panicle length, days to maturity, harvest index, and seed yield were recorded for each variety under irrigation at Bunda and Bembeke, and under rainfed conditions at Bunda. Plant height was significantly influenced by both genotype and environment. There were also significant differences between the two locations for panicle length whereas genotype and genotype × environment (G × E) interaction were not significantly different. Differences were found for genotype and G × E interaction for harvest index. Notably, differences for genotype, environment and G × E were found for grain yield. Seed yield was higher at Bunda (237–3019 kg/ha) than Bembeke (62–692 kg/ha) under irrigated conditions. The highest yielding genotype at Bunda was Titicaca (3019 kg/ha) whereas Multi-Hued was the highest (692 kg/ha) at Bembeke. Strong positive correlations between seed yield and (1) plant height (r = 0.74), (2) days to maturity (r = 0.76), and (3) biomass (r = 0.87) were found under irrigated conditions. The rainfed evaluations at Bunda revealed significant differences in seed yield, plant biomass, and seed size among the genotypes. The highest yielding genotype was Black Seeded (2050 kg/ha) followed by Multi-Hued (1603 kg/ha) and Bio-Bio (1446 kg/ha). Ecuadorian (257 kg/ha) was the lowest yielding genotype. In general the seed yields of the genotypes were lower under rainfed conditions than under irrigated conditions at Bunda. The results also highlight the need to continue evaluating a diverse number of cultivars to select for genotypes adapted to specific agro-ecological areas and across seasons in Malawi.",https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpls.2017.00227/pdf,

Joint adaptation planning by farmers and researchers can help develop practically feasible and environmentally and economically sound adaptation actions as well as encourage the proactive building of farm adaptive capacity. Here, the perceptions of Finnish farmers and rural stakeholders regarding intercropping, the cultivation of two or more crop genotypes together in time and space, as a means to prepare for climate change, were collected in an open workshop. Our aim was to identify the potentials and challenges associated with intercropping, its role as an adaptation strategy, and in farm adaptive capacity. Qualitative analysis revealed better yield security, increased nutrient and protein self-sufficiency, soil conservation and maintenance, reduced pathogen pressure and regulation of water dynamics as the main perceived potentials of intercropping. Potentials relating to the farm economy and environment were also recognized. The main challenges associated with intercropping were related to the lack of information on crop variety performance and optimal yielding in mixtures, industry and policy requirements for seed purity, more complicated crop management and harvesting, and the economic risks associated with experimenting with novel mixtures. Nitrogen-fixing legumes; deep-rooted species, such as lucerne (Medicago sativa L.); special crops, such as herbs in forage mixtures; and autumn-sown winter oilseeds and cereals were highlighted as the most promising intercrops. Because the recognized potentials relate to the safeguarding of field cropping from anticipated climate change and the associated weather variability, we conclude that intercropping can serve as one adaptation strategy to strengthen the adaptive capacity of Finnish farms. However, assuring markets and policies that allow the development of intercropping, performing experiments to assess the benefits and implement options in practice, and providing farmers and farm advisors with more knowledge on the method represent the critical prerequisites for the broader adoption of intercropping.",https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0472/6/3/34/pdf?version=1469780886,

Working with a panel of practitioners and regional experts, we developed and analyzed four plausible but divergent land-use scenarios that depict the future of Massachusetts from 2010 to 2060 to address two questions: (1) “How do the magnitude and spatial distribution of ecosystem service provisioning vary under the different land-use regimes?” and (2) “What are the synergies and trade-offs among direct human uses, ecosystem services, and habitat quality?” Each scenario specifies the detailed prescriptions for the major uses of the forests, including conversion to residential and commercial development, clearing new farmland, shifting silvicultural practices, and designating forests protected from development. We simulated the land-use scenarios and their interactions with anticipated climate change by coupling statistical models of land use to the LANDIS-II landscape model and then evaluated the outcomes in terms of the magnitude and spatial distribution of (1) direct human uses of the landscape (residential and commercial development, agricultural, timber harvest), (2) ecosystem services (carbon storage, flood regulation, nutrient retention), and (3) habitat quality (forest tree species composition, interior forest habitat). Across all scenarios, conflicts occurred between dispersed residential development and the supply of ecosystem services and habitat quality. In all but the scenario that envisioned a significant agricultural expansion, forest growth resulted in net increases in aboveground carbon storage, despite the concomitant forest clearing and harvesting. One scenario, called Forests as Infrastructure, showed the potential for synergies between increased forest harvest volume through the sustainable practices that encouraged the maintenance of economically and ecologically important tree species, and carbon storage. This scenario also showed trade-offs between development density and water quantity and quality at the watershed scale. The process of integrated scenario analysis led to important insights for land managers and policymakers in a populated forested region where there are tensions among development, forest harvesting, and land conservation. More broadly, the results emphasize the need to consider the consequences of contrasting land-use regimes that result from the interactions between human decisions and spatially heterogeneous landscape dynamics.",https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1002/ecs2.1469,

In response, Rain Water Harvest (RWH) is the measure as an alternative source towards water shortage problem and a decrease in groundwater extraction. However, the identification of optimal sites for RWH is an important step to maximize the amount of water harvested and minimize the ecological impact. In this study, an Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) was used to determinate optimal sites using Geographic Information Systems (GIS) in order to integrate spatial information. Physical and socio-economic features were main decision criteria along with six sub-criteria: potential runoff; land use; soil texture; slope; distance from agricultural land; and distance from roads. In the investigation, several different criteria with different AHP structures were utilized to assess the flexibility of structures.

As CO 2 concentration records in the atmosphere exceed 50 years and as satellite records reach over 30 years in length, we are becoming better able to address carbon cycle variability and trends. Here we review how variable the carbon cycle is, how large the trends in its gross and net fluxes are, and how well the signal can be separated from noise. We explore mechanisms that explain year-to-year variability and trends by deconstructing the global carbon budget. The CO 2 concentration record is detecting a significant increase in the seasonal amplitude between 1958 and now. Inferential methods provide a variety of explanations for this result, but a conclusive attribution remains elusive. Scientists have reported that this trend is a consequence of the greening of the biosphere, stronger northern latitude photosynthesis, more photosynthesis by semi-arid ecosystems, agriculture and the green revolution, tropical temperature anomalies, or increased winter respiration. At the global scale, variability in the terrestrial carbon cycle can be due to changes in constituent fluxes, gross primary productivity, plant respiration and heterotrophic (microbial) respiration, and losses due to fire, land use change, soil erosion, or harvesting. It remains controversial whether or not there is a significant trend in global primary productivity (due to rising CO 2, temperature, nitrogen deposition, changing land use, and preponderance of wet and dry regions). The degree to which year-to-year variability in temperature and precipitation anomalies affect global primary productivity also remains uncertain. For perspective, interannual variability in global gross primary productivity is relatively small (on the order of 2 Pg-C y -1) with respect to a large and uncertain background (123 +/- 4 Pg-C y -1), and detected trends in global primary productivity are even smaller (33 Tg-C y -2). Yet residual carbon balance methods infer that the terrestrial biosphere is experiencing a significant and growing carbon sink. Possible explanations for this large and growing net land sink include roles of land use change and greening of the land, regional enhancement of photosynthesis, and down regulation of plant and soil respiration with warming temperatures. Longer time series of variables needed to provide top-down and bottom-up assessments of the carbon cycle are needed to resolve these pressing and unresolved issues regarding how, why, and at what rates gross and net carbon fluxes are changing.",https://f1000research.com/articles/5-2371/v1/pdf,

The emissions of N2O are mostly from agriculture and they contribute to warming on both short and long time scales. The effects of $$\hbox{NO}_{{x}}$$ and NH3 on CH4, O3, and aerosols are complex, and quantification of these effects is difficult. However, the net result on time scales of decades is likely one of cooling, which becomes less significant on longer time scales. Deposition of N onto ecosystems also affects sources and sinks of N2O, CH4, and CO2, but the dominant effect is changes in carbon (C) stocks. Primary productivity in most temperate ecosystems is limited by N, so inputs from atmospheric deposition tend to stimulate plant growth and plant litter production, leading in some cases to significant C sequestration in biomass and soils. The literature reviewed here indicates a range of estimates spanning 20–70 kg C sequestered per kg N deposited in forests, which are the dominant C sinks. Most of the sequestration occurs in aboveground forest biomass, with less consistency and lower rates reported for C sequestration in soils. The permanency of the forest biomass sink is uncertain, but data for the fate of forest products in the US indicate that only a small fraction of enhanced forest biomass C is sequestered in long-term harvest products or in unmanaged forests. The net effect of all of these N cycle processes on radiative forcing in the US is probably a modest cooling effect for a 20-year time frame, although the uncertainty of this estimate includes zero net effect, and a modest warming for a 100-year time frame. We know that N-cycling processes are important and that biotic feedbacks to climate change are unlikely to be properly modeled or assessed without including C–N interactions. However, due to the complexity of biological processes involving C–N–climate interactions, biogeochemical models are still poorly constrained with respect to ecosystem responses to impacts of N deposition and climate change. Only recently have N-cycling processes been incorporated into Earth system models for C–N interactions. The robustness of these models remains to be demonstrated. Much work remains for improving their representation in models used to simulate climate forcing scenarios.",https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10533-012-9787-z.pdf,

Biomass burning plays a significant role in air pollution and climate change. In this study, we used the method based on fire radiative energy (FRE) to develop a biomass burning emission inventory for China from 2003 to 2017. Daily fire radiative power (FRP) data in 1 km MODIS Thermal Anomalies/Fire products (MOD14/MYD14) were used to calculate FRE and combusted biomass. Available emission factors were assigned to four land-cover types: forest, cropland, grassland and shrubland. The farming system and crop types in different climate zones were taken into account in this research. Compared with traditional methods, the FRE method was found to provide a more reasonable estimates of emissions from small fires. The estimated average annual emission ranges, with a 90 % confidence interval, were 94.2 (78.7–117.6) Tg CO2 yr−1, 4.9 (2.5–8.3) Tg CO yr−1, 0.19 (0.05–0.51) Tg CH4 yr−1, 0.52 (0.18–0.81) Tg NMHC yr−1, 0.18 (0.04–0.39) Tg NOx yr−1, 0.07 (0.02–0.17) Tg NH3 yr−1, 0.03 (0.01–0.06) Tg SO2 yr−1, 0.04 (0.01–0.08) Tg BC yr−1, 0.3 (0.08–0.53) Tg OC yr−1, 0.49 (0.20–0.88) Tg PM2.5 yr−1, 0.56 (0.16–1.11) Tg PM10 yr−1. Forest fire was identified as the major source of the biomass burning emissions, and crop residue burning was the second highest contributor. In the 15-year study period, emissions from forest fires showed a significant downward trend. Crop residue emissions continued to rise until 2014, and then began to decline. Emissions from grassland and shrubland were little changed. Forest, grassland, and shrubland fires are mostly located in regions with high vegetation coverage, where the occurrence of fires is concentrated in arid seasons (spring and autumn). Plain areas with high crop yields, such as the North China Plain, experienced high agricultural fire emissions in harvest seasons. The resolution (daily, 1 km) of our inventory is much higher than previous inventories, such as GFED4s and GFASv1.0. It could be used in global and regional air quality modeling.",https://bg.copernicus.org/articles/16/1629/2019/bg-16-1629-2019.pdf,

The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of timing and concentration of (S)-cisabscisic acid (S-ABA), a specific isomer of abscisic acid applied to ‘Isabel’ grapes, aiming to increase anthocyanin accumulation and to improve juice quality. The trial was conducted on two consecutive seasons (2011 and 2012) in a commercial vineyard located in Maringa, PR, Brazil. The vines were trained in an overhead trellis system and spaced at 4.0 3 1.0 m. The statistical model used was a randomized block design with four replications and five treatments: control; S-ABA at 200 mg·L at 7 days after veraison (DAV); S-ABA at 400 mg·L at 7 DAV; S-ABA at 200 mg·L at 7 DAV + 200 mg·L at 15 days after the first application (DAFA); and S-ABA at 400 mg·L at 7 DAV + 400 mg·L at 15 DAFA. There were no significant differences between treatments in relation to berry or cluster size or weight. S-ABA application resulted in increased anthocyanin concentrations in both berries and juices, mainly when 400 mg·L was applied. Sensory analysis also revealed the efficiency of this plant growth regulator to promote better acceptance of grape juices. Thus, a single application of S-ABA at 400 mg·L at 7 DAV is sufficient to increase the anthocyanins concentration of ‘Isabel’ grapes, improving the acceptance of juice by consumers. American grapes are widely cultivated in some areas of the world such as Brazil and the United States, mainly for grape juice production as well as for the fresh market. ‘Isabel’, syn. ‘Isabella’, grape (Vitis labrusca L.) is one of the most important American cultivars as a result of its high productivity and disease tolerance (Nixdorf and Hermosı́n-Gutiérrez, 2010). However, the juice obtained from this cultivar is deficient in color because of a lack of pigments, needing it to be blended with juices from other pigment-producing grapes. These pigment-producing cultivars, as a rule, are less productive than ‘Isabel’. For this reason, cultivation of ‘Isabel’ is preferred by grape growers because profits are related to the yield obtained in the vineyard (Camargo et al., 2010). Grapes with a more intense color are more appealing for juice and wine elaboration because dark-colored grapes usually have a higher content of phenolic compounds, which are substances containing an aromatic ring with one or more hydroxyl substituents and other functional groups. These phenolic compounds also have beneficial effects on human health by acting to neutralize free radicals (Orak, 2007; Rastija et al., 2009). The major phenolic compounds present in grapes are flavonoids (anthocyanins and flavonols), stilbene (resveratrol), phenolic acids (derivatives of cinnamic and benzoic acids), and a wide variety of tannins (Francis, 2000; Naczk and Shahidi, 2004). Among these compounds, anthocyanins are the plant pigments responsible for most of the blue and purple and all tones of red colors found in flowers, fruits and some leaves, stems, and roots of plants (Markakis, 1982). The amount and composition of this flavonoid in grapes differ according to species, cultivar, maturity, and climatic conditions (Segade et al., 2008). The accumulation of anthocyanins, which starts from veraison (the onset of grape ripening), is responsible for the intensity of the color of berries and appears to be regulated, at least in part, by abscisic acid (ABA) (Ban et al., 2003; Hiratsuka et al., 2001; Owen et al., 2009). Studies have shown that exogenous ABA treatment of hybrid grapes such as ‘Kyoho’ and ‘Olimpia’ (Vitis vinifera · V. labrusca) can increase skin anthocyanin concentrations (Han et al., 1996; Kataoka et al., 1982; Lee and Tomana, 1980; Matsushima et al., 1989). The high cost of ABA synthesis by chemical companies did not justify its use in agriculture (Cantı́n et al., 2007). Recently, a method has been developed for the biological production of S-ABA, a specific isomer of ABA, using the Botrytis cinerea fungus, making the production process economically viable for agricultural use (Owen et al., 2009; Siewers et al., 2006). Since then, the effects of S-ABA have been tested basically on V. vinifera table grapes (Peppi et al., 2007; Peppi and Fidelibus, 2008; Roberto et al., 2012, 2013), but the effect of this plant growth regulator on V. labrusca grapes with lack of pigmentation used for whole juice production was not known, especially those grown in warm climate areas. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of treatments consisting of different concentrations of S-ABA at different times over the final phase of ripening after veraison on ‘Isabel’ grape, aiming to increase the accumulation of anthocyanins in berry and juice. Materials and Methods Grapevines and growing conditions. This study was conducted in a commercial vineyard of own-rooted ‘Isabel’ grapes (Vitis labrusca L.) from 11-year-old vines belonging to the Intervin winery, located in Maringá, state of Paraná (PR), Brazil (lat. 23 25# S, long. 51 57# W, altitude 542 m), on two consecutive crop seasons, 2011 and 2012. According to the Köppen classification, the climate is type Cfa, i.e., subtropical climate with an average temperature in the coldest month below 18 C and average temperature in the warmest month above 22 C. The maximum temperature is 31 C and the average annual rainfall is 1596 mm with a tendency of concentrated rainfall in summer months. The vines were trained on overhead trellis and spaced 4.0 · 1.0 m apart. Pruning was performed to leave two to three buds per spur. Subsequently, 5% hydrogen cyanamide was applied to the buds to induce and standardize sprouting.

S-ABA, at an active concentration of 100 g·L, was supplied by Valent BioSciences Corporation (Libertyville, IL). Treatments and experimental design. The following treatments were tested: 1) control (no application); 2) S-ABA at 200 mg·L at 7 DAV; 3) S-ABA at 400 mg·L at 7 DAV; 4) S-ABA at 200 mg·L at 7 DAV + 200 mg·L at 15 DAFA; and 5) S-ABA at 400 mg·L at 7 DAV + 400 mg·L at 15 DAFA. The randomized blocks design was used as a statistical model with five treatments and four replicates with five vines per plot. Fifteen representative clusters in each plot were marked before the application of treatments for further evaluation. For treatment applications, clusters were sprayed in the morning using a knapsack sprayer at a pressure of 568.93 psi (39.22 bar) with JA1 hollow cone nozzle tips at a volume of 800 L·ha to provide complete and uniform coverage. In addition, 0.3 mL·L of Break-Thru (Evonik Industries, Germany), a non-ionic surfactant, was added to all treatments. Berry sampling and fruits analysis. In both crop seasons, clusters of each plot were manually harvested when soluble solids reached around 16 Brix. For each plot, 90 berries were collected for physicochemical analysis with two berries taken from the upper, middle, and bottom regions of each marked cluster. The physical characteristics of grapes were evaluated by determining the mass (g) and diameter (mm) of berries and the weight (g) and length (cm) of clusters using a scale and a digital caliper. Berry color was analyzed using a colorimeter Minolta CR-10 to obtain the following variables from the equatorial portion of berries (n = 2 per berry): L* (lightness), C* (chroma), and h (hue) (Cantı́n et al., 2007). Lightness values may range from 0 (black) to 100 (white). Chroma indicates the purity or intensity of color, the distance from gray (achromatic) toward a pure chromatic color, and is calculated from the a* and b* values of the CIELab scale system, starts from zero for a completely neutral color, and does not have an arbitrary end, but intensity increases with magnitude. Hue refers to the color wheel and is measured in angles; green, yellow, and red correspond to 180 , 90 , and 0 , respectively (Lancaster et al., 1997; MacGuire, 1992; Peppi et al., 2006). Grape juice production. Whole grape juices from treatment plots were produced by the Welch process (not from concentrate grape juice), which consists of extracting the juice by steam entrainment using a stainless steel extraction pot with a 7-kg capacity (Hauber Macanuda , PSM-07 CF) without any added enzyme (Borges et al., 2013). For this extraction, a sample of 4 kg of clusters from each plot was used, producing an average of 2 L of whole juice. At first, the bottom section of the steamer juicer pot was filled with water and the heat was turned on high. The 4-kg washed grape samples were placed in the top section of the steamer and the basket was filled all the way to the top, and the lid was put on. After 45 min, all grape juice was drained into the middle section of the steamer and then bottled at warm temperature (75 C) into sterilized polyethylene containers with lids and a capacity of 1 L. After cooling, juice bottles were stored in the refrigerator at 4 C for further anthocyanin, polyphenol, and sensory analyses. Anthocyanin extraction. The concentrations of total anthocyanins of berries and juices of all treatments were carried out according to Clemente and Galli (2013). For total anthocyanin extraction from berries, samples of 50 g of berries per plot were used.

This study examines the adaptation strategies to climate change adopted by the dry-land farming communities in Yatta District. Study participants included 510 randomly sampled small-scale farmers. Key informants were district departmental heads from the Ministries of Water, Agriculture and Environment. Questionnaires, interviews, Focus Group Discussions and field observations were used to generate the data. Quantitative data was analysed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) whereas qualitative data was analysed through establishing the categories and themes, relationships/patterns and conclusions drawn in line with the study objectives. Findings indicate that most farmers adopted autonomous adaptation strategies that included planting drought tolerant crops (76.5%), charcoal burning (52.9%) and rainwater harvesting (20.2%) among others. Chi square results indicated that age, level of education and knowledge of climate change had significant influences on adaptation strategies. Some of these strategies had serious adverse environmental impacts on social, economic and biophysical domains of the environment like putting future agricultural production at risk since farms have been converted into sand mining fields. Major limitations to climate change adaptation were financial constraints (93.4%), lack of relevant skills (74.5%) and lack of scientific and technical knowledge (71.6%). The study concludes that farmers are engaging in adaptation strategies that are fundamentally changes in livelihoods and mainly unsustainable. Livelihood activities such as charcoal burning and sand harvesting in their fragile arid and semi-arid lands ecosystem are destructive and thus, not sustainable. These livelihood changes are significantly influenced by levels of education and climate change knowledge. The study recommends that agricultural extension services be enhanced to sensitize the farmers about climate change thus improving their perception and adaptation strategies.   Key words: Climate change, small-scale farmers, adaptation strategies.",https://academicjournals.org/journal/AJEST/article-full-text-pdf/5BD992948228,

We extended an existing semiempirical modeling scheme that allows for such quantification. Yield anomalies, measured as interannual differences, were modeled for maize, soybeans, and wheat in the United States and 32 other main producer countries. We used two yield data sets, one derived from reported yields and the other from a global yield data set deduced from remote sensing. We assessed the capacity of the model to forecast yields within the growing season. In the United States, our model can explain at least two‐thirds (63%–81%) of observed yield anomalies. Its out‐of‐sample performance (34%–55%) suggests a robust yield projection capacity when applied to unknown weather. Out‐of‐sample performance is lower when using remote sensing‐derived yield data. The share of weather‐driven yield fluctuation varies spatially, and estimated coefficients agree with expectations. Globally, the explained variance in yield anomalies based on the remote sensing data set is similar to the United States (71%–84%). But the out‐of‐sample performance is lower (15%–42%). The performance discrepancy is likely due to shortcomings of the remote sensing yield data as it diminishes when using reported yield anomalies instead. Our model allows for robust forecasting of yields up to 2 months before harvest for several main producer countries. An additional experiment suggests moderate yield losses under mean warming, assuming no major changes in temperature extremes. We conclude that our model can detect weather influences on yield anomalies and project yields with unknown weather. It requires only monthly input data and has a low computational demand. Its within‐season yield forecasting capacity provides a basis for practical applications like local adaptation planning. Our study underlines high‐quality yield monitoring and statistics as critical prerequisites to guide adaptation under climate change.",https://edoc.hu-berlin.de/bitstream/18452/20028/5/dissertation_gornott_christoph.pdf,

The slight increase of precipitation may alleviate current groundwater depletion on average, despite the increased evaporation due to warming. Nevertheless, projected climatic extremes create worse GWE shortages than for present climate. Local conditions may lead to opposing impacts on GWE, from increases to decreases (+/−20 mm/year), for a given spatially homogeneous CC forcing.

Impact studies of climate change on crop yields often ignore the potential of adaptation strategies such as rainwater harvesting (RWH). While RWH is bringing benefits to agricultural systems today, it is still unclear which regions could increasingly benefit from RWH under changing climatic conditions. Here we employ a continental scale modelling strategy using the latest CMIP5 data and explicitly take into account design factors of RWH to show that it is a valuable adaptation strategy to climate change in Africa for maize (Zea mays L.). We find that RWH can bridge up to 40 % of the yield gaps attributable to water deficits under current conditions and 31 % under future (2050s) climatic conditions during the main growing season for maize, hence providing an alternative to irrigation from scarce or inaccessible groundwater resources. RWH could increase maize yields by 14–50 % on average for the 2050s across Africa, by bridging water deficits. While in situ RWH strategies show great biophysical potential as an adaptation strategy to climate change, there remain locally specific barriers to their adoption, which will need to be addressed to ensure their successful implementation at a larger scale.",https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11269-015-1091-y.pdf,

This study aims to develop an early forecasting model of cereal yields (soft wheat, barley and durum wheat) at the scale of the agricultural province considering the 15 most productive over 2000–2017 (i.e., 15 × 18 = 270 yields values). To this objective, we built on previous works that showed a tight linkage between cereal yields and various datasets including weather data (rainfall and air temperature), regional climate indices (North Atlantic Oscillation in particular), and drought indices derived from satellite observations in different wavelengths. The combination of the latter three data sets is assessed to predict cereal yields using linear (Multiple Linear Regression, MLR) and non-linear (Support Vector Machine, SVM; Random Forest, RF, and eXtreme Gradient Boost, XGBoost) machine learning algorithms. The calibration of the algorithmic parameters of the different approaches are carried out using a 5-fold cross validation technique and a leave-one-out method is implemented for model validation. The statistical metrics of the models are first analyzed as a function of the input datasets that are used, and as a function of the lead times, from 4 months to 2 months before harvest. The results show that combining data from multiple sources outperformed models based on one dataset only. In addition, the satellite drought indices are a major source of information for cereal prediction when the forecasting is carried out close to harvest (2 months before), while weather data and, to a lesser extent, climate indices, are key variables for earlier predictions. The best models can accurately predict yield in January (4 months before harvest) with an R2 = 0.88 and RMSE around 0.22 t. ha−1. The XGBoost method exhibited the best metrics. Finally, training a specific model separately for each group of provinces, instead of one global model, improved the prediction performance by reducing the RMSE by 10% to 35% depending on the provinces. In conclusion, the results of this study pointed out that combining remote sensing drought indices with climate and weather variables using a machine learning technique is a promising approach for cereal yield forecasting.",https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/13/16/3101/pdf?version=1628211600,

Therefore, in African agricultural lands, adopting/improving measures that conserve soil and water resources is crucial. This review aims to provide an update on soil and water conservation (SWC) in terms of farmer practices and research actions and explore how SWC technologies and practices represent a pathway to build or re-establish soil health and enhance sustainable agriculture in Africa. It also aims to increase knowledge on best-fit SWC approaches. Soil conservation, which includes measures of controlling soil erosion and maintaining or improving soil fertility, is inseparable from water conservation. On agricultural lands, the two are typically co-addressed. Increasing plant biomass production through improved water, crop and soil management practices, and managing this biomass judiciously, have direct and indirect impacts on conserving soils and water resources, particularly in drylands. This study focuses on rainfed agricultural systems. We discuss the barriers and challenges to scaling up best-bet SWC technological and management options. Moreover, we show that options, such as Conservation Agriculture (CA), Agroforestry (AF), as well as integrated soil fertility management (ISFM) and field-scale rainwater harvesting (RWH), remain promising for the preservation and improvement of soil health in Africa’s farmlands and improving the resilience of agrosystems to climate change and variability as well as droughts.",https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/14/20/13425/pdf?version=1666093410,

We found that in general climate variables, both mean and variability, statistically determined the yield and harvested area of sugarcane. Increased population density reduced the harvested area for non-agricultural use.

All species on the planet today have in different ways evolved adaptations that promote fitness sufficiently well enough to sustain different metapopulations over long periods of time relative to the pace of environmental change. Indeed, species’ lifespans are estimated to be on the order of millions of years (Barnosky et al., 2011). At the same time, we now appreciate that evolution is a contemporary process that modifies traits and shapes fitness each and every generation (Carroll, Hendry, Reznick, & Fox, 2007; Hendry & Kinnison, 1999). As we show in this special issue, these two elements of evolutionary change— macroevolutionary diversification and contemporary evolutionary change—bear critical insights for ecotoxicology and point toward a fruitful integration of the fields of toxicology and evolutionary biology. Many adaptations that have arisen over macroevolutionary timescales reflect responses to selection imposed by toxins that characterized the early environment on the planet (Kirschvink & Kopp, 2008; Monosson, 2012; Tobler et al., 2011). Indeed, much of the early evolution of life, from its origins to the evolution of multicellular plants and animals, faced a central problem of evolving mechanisms for coping with toxicity imposed, for example, by heavy metals, ultraviolet light, oxygen, microbial toxins, and defensive chemicals produced by plants (Cockell, 1998; Coyle, Philcox, Carey, & Rofe, 2002; Kirschvink & Kopp, 2008; Rico, 2001). For modern ecotoxicology, evolutionary history suggests that in some cases, extant species may already possess preadaptations or adaptive capacity for dealing with exposure to toxicants (sensu Motychak, Brodie, & Edmund, 1999; Llewelyn et al., 2011). Further, closely related species may share similar tolerances to similar toxicants (Guénard, von der Ohe, de Zwart, Legendre, & Lek, 2011). Therefore, the evolutionary history of a given species or group of species may provide an important source of variation associated with tolerance to contaminants found in the environment today (e.g., Hammond, Jones, Stephens, & Relyea, 2012). This predictive capacity may be particularly true for historical toxins that have been remobilized as contaminants by recent human activities (e.g., via land use practices, agriculture, and mining). In contrast, adapting to novel contaminants such as synthetically produced chemicals with no precedent of occurrence in the environment may prove especially challenging, for example, if adaptive responses require novel genetic variation (Barrett and Schluter 2008). Moreover, the occurrence of contaminants alongside numerous other humaninduced selection pressures (e.g., climate change, ocean acidification, habitat conversion, commercial harvest) may further challenge the ability of organisms to adapt to environmental contaminants. After all, an individual’s fitness is influenced by the sum total of all stressors, which can act additively, antagonistically, and/or synergistically. In addition to the influence that macroevolution has had on species’ tolerance for toxins and toxicants, ongoing contemporary evolutionary change mediates tolerance over time periods relevant to policy and conservation. Although this view of evolution as a contemporary process has only recently become more prevalent in toxicology (Bickham, 2011), the awareness of the potential for organisms to adapt to environmental toxicants dates back to at least the early 20th century. At that time, Melander (1914) reported an experiment showing a reduced effectiveness of sulfurlime treatments on the agricultural pest Quadraspidiotus perniciosus (San Jose scale), a result contrasting the usual effect of complete mortality. This example appears to be the first reported evidence of pesticide resistance. Three decades later in 1945, with use of the miracle drug penicillin on the rise, Alexander Fleming saw fit to conclude his Nobel Lecture with a cautionary tale about the possibility of the evolution of antibiotic resistance, forewarning the inefficacy of treatment that would follow (Nobelprize. org). These early examples of resistance provided some of the first evidence that evolution can be quite rapid and that evolutionary change",https://doi.org/10.1111/eva.12519,

We performed an experiment to mitigate the impact of heat waves and exposure of berries in grapevine (Vitis vinifera cv. “Cabernet Sauvignon”) with untreated vines (Exposed) or with fruit-zone partial shading (Shaded) under 40 and 80% replacement of crop evapotranspiration (ETc) with sustained deficit irrigation in a factorially arranged experiment. The trial was performed in a vineyard with vertically shoot positioned trellis with a row orientation that concentrated solar radiation exposure on the southwest aspect of the fruit zone. Leaf stomatal conductance (gs) and net carbon assimilation (AN) were significantly lower in shaded leaves under partial fruit-zone shading that resulted in lower pruning mass for Shaded treatments. Stem water potential (Ψstem) responded to a large extent to increased irrigation. However, grapevines with partial fruit-zone shading had transiently better water status under 40% ETc. Cluster maximum temperatures were 3.9°C greater in Exposed grapevines. Exposed clusters had transiently lower acidity and higher pH. However, Exposed clusters on 40% ETc had higher total soluble solids (TSS). The experimental vineyard suffered a 4-day heat wave 21 days before harvest, resulting in 25% of the clusters being damaged in Exposed treatment, regardless of irrigation amount. Furthermore, berries in Exposed treatments suffered a great loss of anthocyanins and flavonols even if they were not damaged by direct solar exposure. The pre-planting decision of using a vertically shoot positioned trellis that concentrated solar radiation on the Southwest aspect offered mild protection in a hot climate region with a sunny growing season with extreme heat events during the execution of study. The extreme conditions under which this study was conducted are not unusual, and have become more expected.

In contrast to raising biomass harvests in forests, purpose‐grown biomass does not interfere with forest carbon (C) stocks. Provided that agricultural land can be diverted from food and feed production without impairing food security, energy plantations on current agricultural land appear as a beneficial option in terms of renewable, climate‐friendly energy supply. However, instead of supporting energy plantations, land could also be devoted to natural succession. It then acts as a long‐term C sink which also results in C benefits. We here compare the sink strength of natural succession on arable land with the C saving effects of bioenergy from plantations. Using geographically explicit data on global cropland distribution among climate and ecological zones, regionally specific C accumulation rates are calculated with IPCC default methods and values. C savings from bioenergy are given for a range of displacement factors (DFs), acknowledging the varying efficiency of bioenergy routes and technologies in fossil fuel displacement. A uniform spatial pattern is assumed for succession and bioenergy plantations, and the considered timeframes range from 20 to 100 years. For many parameter settings—in particular, longer timeframes and high DFs—bioenergy yields higher cumulative C savings than natural succession. Still, if woody biomass displaces liquid transport fuels or natural gas‐based electricity generation, natural succession is competitive or even superior for timeframes of 20–50 years. This finding has strong implications with climate and environmental policies: Freeing land for natural succession is a worthwhile low‐cost natural climate solution that has many co‐benefits for biodiversity and other ecosystem services. A considerable risk, however, is C stock losses (i.e., emissions) due to disturbances or land conversion at a later time.",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1111/gcbb.12626,

Objective of this study was to analyze growing season trend in top five processing tomato-producing counties in California through the use of growing degree-days model and historical and future climate scenarios generated from the general circulation model (GCM). Based on the findings, the models indicated a significant decrease in the number of days between transplanting and maturity, with an expected harvest 2–3 weeks earlier than normal under current conditions and cultivars. Results from this study could be utilized to make strategic decisions such as variety selection, planting and harvest dates, agricultural water management, and studying trends in pests and diseases due to shifts and lengthening of tomato growing season in the tomato production areas of California.",https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs40808-018-0460-y.pdf,

The main findings show how seasonal climate forecast provides useful information for decision-making processes in the European winter wheat-producing sector. Flowering time can be reliably predicted already at the beginning of the growing season in central and eastern Europe, thus supporting effective variety selection and timely planning of agro-management practices. The predictability of climate events relevant for winter wheat production is strongly dependent on the forecast initialization time as well as the nature of the event being predicted. Overall, regionally skillful and reliable predictions of drought events during the sensitive periods of wheat flowering and grain filling can be made already at the end of winter. On the contrary, predicting excessive wetness seems to be very challenging as no or very limited skill is estimated during the entire wheat growing season.

Insect pests are major biotic constraints affecting potato yields and tuber quality. The high pesticide uses to control them is of high human and environmental health concern, and it is expected that this will be further exacerbated through impacts of climate change. The chapter provides an overview of the geographical distribution of potato insect pests and their importance in tropical, subtropical, and temperate potato production regions. Climate change will potentially contribute to expand their geographical range of distribution, and increasing populations will lead to greater crop and post-harvest losses. Good progress has been made in applying insect pest modeling in pest risk analysis of potato pests to inform and create better awareness of future pest risks under climate change. Potato pests include some of the species which have evolved resistance to a wide variety of chemicals; and potato growers have already experienced the situation that available chemicals failed to control their targets. This chapter emphasizes the development, use, and adaptation of Integrated Pest Management (IPM) across all potato-growing regions of the world. Ultimately, this will lead to sustainable and more resilient potato production systems not overly dependent on pesticides. IPM requires a good knowledge and understanding of individual potato production systems; identifying pest species, knowing their biology and symptoms of infestation is essential for making educated decisions on their integrated management. To address this need, the chapter provides detailed information for a total of 49 insect pests of potato and the status quo of their management around the world.",https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2F978-3-030-28683-5_8.pdf,

Building-up soil organic carbon (SOC) enhances soil fertility and efficient use of rainwater, which can increase drought tolerance in food production. SOC management demonstrates its benefit at various locations and is a promising means to achieve food security and climate mitigation at once. However, no global assessment of its potential and co-benefits gained from SOC enhancement has been presented. Here we evaluated the extent to which SOC build-up could reduce agricultural drought risk. Using statistical analysis of spatially-explicit global crop and soil datasets, we find that relatively small enhancement in topsoil (0–30 cm) organic carbon content (OCtop) could increase drought tolerance of the food production systems operating over 70% of the global harvested area (particularly drylands). By closing the gap between current and upper limit of tolerance levels through SOC addition of 4.87 GtC at the global scale, farmer’s economic output in drought years would increase by ~16%.

Extreme temperature causes a significant reduction in crop yields by negatively regulating the crop phenology. Therefore, to evaluate warming impact on cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) production and management practices, we quantified agrometeorological data of 30 years by applying multiple crop modelling tools to compute the expected rise in temperature, impact of crop phenology, yield loss, provision of agrometeorology-services, agronomic technologies, and adaptation to climate-smart agriculture. Model projections of 15 agrometeorology stations showed that the growing duration of the sowing-boll opening and sowing-harvesting stages was reduced by 2.30 to 5.66 days decade−1 and 4.23 days decade−1, respectively, in Pakistan. Temperature rise in China also advanced the planting dates, sowing emergence, 3–5 leaves, budding anthesis, full-bloom, cleft-boll, boll-opening, and boll-opening filling by 24.4, 26.2, 24.8, 23.3, 22.6, 15.8, 14.6, 5.4, 2.9, and 8.0 days.

Persons with diabetes are at greater risk for developing other diseases such as cardiovascular disease. Navajos with diabetes almost certainly face a diminished quality of life if their diabetes is not managed properly. Aside from genetics, the incidence of diabetes is highly correlated with income, poor diet, and limited physical exercise. A review of the literature also implicates dietary shifts initiated by historical events and contemporary trends. Numerous studies have shown that moderate consumption of fruits and vegetables, combined with exercise, reduces the risk of or delays the onset of many diseases including diabetes. As part of a larger holistic approach, home and community garden projects have successfully addressed nutrition and food security issues on a grassroots scale. The Navajos have a tradition of farming and therefore expanding Navajo diabetes interventions to include the promotion of community and home gardens provides multiple opportunities. The benefits of these actions include: (i) a variety of nutritious food grown locally; (ii) physical activity attained through the act of daily gardening tasks; (iii) positive income garnered in terms of savings in food otherwise purchased at stores and excess produce canned, or if desired, sold at a farmer's market or trading post; and (iv) positive mental outlook through a combined sense of accomplishment at harvest time, bonding with the earth, and spiritual growth. The objectives of this article were to review the development of diabetes on the Navajo nation though historical and contemporary literature, to provide insight into the role of diet and exercise in the progression of the disease, and to offer cases and suggestions in the role that home and community gardening can play in diabetes reduction.

In the agricultural sector, practices that mitigate GHG emissions include those that (1) reduce emissions [e.g., those that reduce nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions by avoiding excess nitrogen (N) fertilizer application], and (2) increase soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks (e.g., by retaining instead of burning crop residues). Sugarcane is a globally important crop that can have substantial inputs of N fertilizer and which produces large amounts of crop residues (‘trash’). Management of N fertilizer and trash affects soil carbon and nitrogen cycling, and hence GHG emissions. Trash has historically been burned at harvest, but increasingly is being retained on the soil surface as a ‘trash blanket’ in many countries. The potential for trash retention to alter N fertilizer requirements and sequester SOC was investigated in this study. The APSIM model was calibrated with data from field and laboratory studies of trash decomposition in the wet tropics of northern Australia. APSIM was then validated against four independent data sets, before simulating location × soil × fertilizer × trash management scenarios. Soil carbon increased in trash blanketed soils relative to SOC in soils with burnt trash. However, further increases in SOC for the study region may be limited because the SOC in trash blanketed soils could be approaching equilibrium; future GHG mitigation efforts in this region should therefore focus on N fertilizer management. Simulated N fertilizer rates were able to be reduced from conventional rates regardless of trash management, because of low yield potential in the wet tropics. For crops subjected to continuous trash blanketing, there was substantial immobilization of N in decomposing trash so conventional N fertilizer rates were required for up to 24 years after trash blanketing commenced. After this period, there was potential to reduce N fertilizer rates for crops when trash was retained (≤20 kg N ha–1 per plant or ratoon crop) while maintaining ≥95% of maximum yields. While these savings in N fertilizer use were modest at the field scale, they were potentially important when aggregated at the regional level.",https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpls.2016.01017/pdf,

Interest in diversified, mixed oil palm systems is increasing as these might increase efficiency of the use of land and other resources, reduce farmer risk, and decrease greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions per unit product. Land Equivalent Ratio for provisioning services (LERP) values above 1.0 show that at least some diversified systems use land more efficiently than monocultures and are thus “land sparing,” where monoculture LERP cannot exceed 1.0. Diversification also modifies climate and water regulating functions (“land sharing”) relative to a forest reference, as indicated in the LERR index. A “multifunctional” LERM indicator combines both; land sparing plus land sharing effects jointly determine expected regulating services. Empirical assessment of multiple ecosystem services in agricultural landscapes is assisted by models that synthesise process-based knowledge, especially for perennial systems where well-designed experiments require a full production cycle, and are costly and scarce. Agroforestry models explore spacing, intercropping and soil management options, predicting harvestable yields, impacts on water flows, nutrient leaching, and greenhouse gas emissions. We used the process-based Water, Nutrient and Light Capture in Agroforestry System (WaNuLCAS) model to explore mixed oil palm + cocoa and oil palm + pepper intercrop systems with modified (“double row”) planting patterns for Indonesian contexts and estimated consequences for the carbon footprint. The oil palm + cocoa intercrop provided a high LERP (1.4), while also replenishing more ground water and having a lower C footprint. This combination also has a return to labour equal to that in oil palm monocultures and a higher benefit cost ratio than the oil palm + pepper combination that maximizes Net Present Value. Oil palm + cocoa systems are also less sensitive to price uncertainty for oil palm, and buffer for oil palm and cocoa production risks, assumed to be independent of each other. Considerable economic and environmental system improvements appear to be feasible through mixed oil palm systems and diversification as a pathway to intensification deserves full attention of research and policy development.",https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fsufs.2019.00122/pdf,

Site-specific yield trends were assessed in areas where those crops have experienced increasing yield or where yields have stagnated or declined. We find that rice yields have continued to increase on over 12.3 million hectares (m. ha) or 41.8% of the rice area in China between 1980 and 2010.

The LULUCF regulation aim to incentivise EU Member States to decrease greenhouse gas emissions and increase removals in the LULUCF sector. The regulation, however, does not set a target for increasing the LULUCF carbon sink, but rather includes a ‘no net debit’ target for LULUCF (Forests and Agricultural soils). For Managed Forest Land (MFL) an accounting framework with capped credits for additional mitigation against a set forest reference level (FRL) was agreed for 2021–2030. The FRL gives the projected future carbon sink in the two compliance periods 2021–2025 and 2026–2030 under “continuation of forest management practices as they were in the reference period 2000–2009”. This FRL was disputed by some Member States as it was perceived to put a limit on their future wood harvesting from MFL. Here we simulated with the EFISCEN European forest model the “continuation of forest management practices” and determined the corresponding wood harvest for 26 EU countries under progressing age classes.ResultsThe simulations showed that under “continuation of forest management practices” the harvest (wood removals) in the 26 EU countries as a whole can increase from 420 million m3/year in 2000–2009 to 560 million m3/year in 2050 due to progressing age classes. This implies there is a possibility to increase absolute wood harvests without creating debits compared to the forest reference level. However, the manner in which ‘continuation of forest management’ developed with a progressing age class development over time, meant that in some countries the future harvesting exceeded 90% of the increment. Since this generally is considered to be unsustainable we additionally set a harvesting cut-off as max 90% of increment to be harvested for each individual country as a possible interpretation of sustainability criteria that are included in the regulation. Using this additional limit the projected harvest will only increase to 493 million m3/year.ConclusionsThe worry from Member States (MS) that the FRL will prevent any additional harvesting seems unwarranted. Due to differences between Member States concerning the state of their forest resources, the FRL as a baseline for harvesting works out very differently for the different Member States. The FRL may have other unforeseen consequences which we discuss. Under all scenarios the living forest biomass sink shows a decline. This can be counteracted through incentivising measures under Climate Smart Forestry.",https://cbmjournal.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s13021-018-0107-3,

Therefore, any small change in the amount of soil organic C (SOC) may affect carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations in the atmosphere. Dynamic models of SOC help reveal the interaction among soil carbon systems, climate and land management and they are also frequently used to help assess SOC dynamics. Those models often use allometric functions to calculate soil C inputs in which the amount of C in both above and below ground crop residues are assumed to be proportional to crop harvest yield. Here we argue that simulating changes in SOC stocks based on C input that are proportional to crop yield is not supported by data from long-term experiments with measured SOC changes. Rather, there is evidence that root C inputs are largely independent of crop yield, but crop specific.

This review article focused on biomimetic innovations, including bio-inspired soft robots and swarm robots that could serve multiple functions, including the harvesting of fruits, pest control, and crop management. The research demonstrated commercially available biomimetic innovations, including robot bees by Arugga AI Farming and the Robotriks Traction Unit (RTU) precision farming equipment. Additionally, soft robotic systems have made it possible to mitigate the risk of surface bruises, rupture, the crushing destruction of plant tissue, and plastic deformation in the harvesting of fruits with a soft rind such as apples, cherries, pears, stone fruits, kiwifruit, mandarins, cucumbers, peaches, and pome. Even though the smart farming technologies, which were developed to mimic nature, could help prevent climate change and enhance the intensification of agriculture, there are concerns about long-term ecological impact, cost, and their inability to complement natural processes such as pollination. Despite the problems, the market for bio-inspired technologies with potential agricultural applications to modernize farming and solve the abovementioned challenges has increased exponentially.

Models suggest that heat extremes affect worker health, reduce labor capacity, and commodity supply. Chronic health conditions are on the rise internationally. However there is a paucity of direct empirical evidence relating increasing temperatures to both agricultural worker health and productivity. Methods and findings We evaluated the relationship between temperature exposure, kidney function, and two measures of productivity—tons of commodity produced and job attrition, of 4,095 Guatemalan sugarcane cutters over a 6-month harvest. We used distributed lag non-linear models to evaluate associations between wet bulb globe temperature (WBGT) and productivity of workers with normal or impaired kidney function. The cumulative effect of exposure to a max WBGT of 34°C was 1.16 tons (95% CI: -2.87, 0.54) less sugarcane cut over the next five days by workers with impaired kidney function, compared to exposure to 29°C. Impaired kidney function was associated with premature workforce attrition. Workers starting the harvest season with impaired kidney function were more than twice as likely to leave employment (HR: 2.92, 95% CI: 1.88, 4.32). Conclusions Heat extremes may be associated with loss of agricultural worker productivity and employment, especially among those with impaired kidney function.

This strategy involves capturing carbon dioxide (CO2) from stationary bioenergy facilities and sequestering it in suitable geological formations, effectively removing CO2 from the atmosphere. Many factors potentially limit BECCS deployment including obstacles to building pipeline networks that move large quantities of liquefied CO2 over long distances. Here, we examine the BECCS opportunity that exists in regions overlapping storage basins. Under current conditions, the equivalent of 22.9 GtCO2 y−1 of net primary production (NPP), a measure of biomass growth, overlies highly prospective CO2 storage basins, representing a sustainably harvestable total of approximately 7.6 GtCO2 y−1. Most land overlying basins is either forested or linked to food production. If only marginal agricultural lands, those inconsistently under agricultural production, are used to source biomass, the scale of the available resource is approximately 1 GtCO2 y−1. If transportation of biomass or CO2 is constrained, and if BECCS is not developed on forests or prime croplands, then BECCS deployments will be limited to a small, but meaningful fraction (~10%) of the levels typical in cost-optimized model trajectories that stabilize warming at 2 °C or less above pre-industrial temperatures.

Descriptive statistics such as frequency distribution, percentage and mean scores were used in data analysis. The result revealed that majority of the local people have a very good knowledge of climate variability and change in terms of higher temperature, higher rainfall intensity and variability, and the occurrence of extreme weather events such as flood and drought. Findings also revealed that community disobeying God, deforestation, bush burning, combustion of fossil fuel and pollution were the major causes of climate variability and change as perceived by the respondents. The most significant impacts of climate variability and change as perceived by the local people were decline in crop yields, decline in forest resources, water shortages and decrease in soil fertility. These impacts have resulted to rural-urban migration in the area. Sustainable adaptation strategies adopted by the local people are water harvesting, the use of fertilizer/animals dung to improve crop yield, irrigation agriculture, planting of crop varieties and drought resistant crops.

Water for irrigation and low soil fertility are among the main challenges. One way to decrease water consumption in paddy fields is to change the irrigation regime for rice production, replacing continuous flooding with alternate wetting and drying. In order to assess the impact of different irrigation regimes and nitrogen fertilizer applications on growth, yield, and water productivity of rice, a greenhouse pot experiment with soil from lowland rice ecology was conducted at Sokoine University of Agriculture, Tanzania during the 2019 cropping season. The experiment was split-plot based on randomized complete block design with 12 treatments and 3 replications. Water regimes were the main factors comparing continuous flooding (CF) and alternate wetting and drying (AWD) with nitrogen fertilizer levels as the subfactor, comparing absolute control (no fertilizer) with 0 (P and K fertilizers), 60, 90, 120, and 150 kg Nha−1. Alternate wetting and drying (AWD) significantly improved water productivity by 8.3% over CF (p < 0.05). Water productivity (WP) ranged from 0.6 to 1.5 kg of rice per m3 of water. Average water use ranged from 36 to 82 L per season, and water saving was up to 34.3%. Alternate wetting and drying significantly improved yields (p < 0.05) by 13.3%, and the yield ranged from 21.8 to 118.2 g pot−1. The combination of AWD water management and 60 kg N ha−1 nitrogen fertilization application was found to be the optimal management, however there was no significant difference between 60 and 90 kg N ha−1, in which case 60 kg N ha−1 is recommended because it lowers costs and raises net income. Nitrogen levels significantly affected water productivity, water use, and number of irrigations. Nitrogen levels had significant effect (p < 0.05) on plant height, number of tillers, flag leaf area, chlorophyll content, total tillers, number of productive tillers, panicle weight, panicle length, 1000-grain weight, straw yield, grain yield, and grain harvest index. The results showed that less water can be used to produce more crops under alternative wetting and drying irrigation practices. The results are important for water-scarce areas, providing useful information to policy makers, farmers, agricultural departments, and water management boards in devising future climate-smart adaptation and mitigation strategies.",https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4395/11/8/1629/pdf?version=1629254099,

Given the projected population growth, sustainable agriculture must accomplish food security while also being economically viable, socially responsible, and having the least possible impact on biodiversity and natural ecosystems. Deep learning has shown to be a sophisticated approach for big data analysis, with several successful cases in image processing, object identification, and other domains. It has lately been applied in food science and engineering. Among the issues and concerns addressed by these systems were food recognition; quality detection of fruits, vegetables, meat, and aquatic items; food supply chain; and food contamination. In precision agriculture, Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a commonly used technology for estimating food quality. It is especially important when evaluating crops at different phases of harvest and postharvest. Crop disease and damage detection is a high-priority activity because some postharvest diseases or damages, such as decay, can destroy crops and produce poisons that are toxic to humans. In this paper, we use Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)-based U-Net, DeepLab, and Mask R-CNN models to detect and predict postharvest deterioration zones in stored apple fruits. Our approach is unique in that it segmented and predicted postharvest decay and nondecay zones in fruits separately.

The loss in agriculture production is the most predominant impact among many, especially in drought-prone regions of India. Aggravating this further are the non-climatic risks like depletion of groundwater, land fragmentation, lack of post-harvest structures and disappearing and deteriorating common property resources among many others.

A community engaging vulnerability assessment tool was used to explore the climate risks and vulnerabilities of different social groups. Insights indicate that vulnerability is socially differentiated and across farmer categories and social groups. Caste and social standing play a significant role in access to resources, land ownership, livelihoods choices and approaches – impacting their vulnerability to climate change.

In response, they are developing climate action plans that also support their sustainable development goals, but conventional adaptation approaches such as hard flood defenses can be expensive and unsustainable. Nature-based solutions (NbS) could provide cost-effective options to address these challenges but policymakers lack evidence on their effectiveness. To address this knowledge gap, we focused on Bangladesh, which is exceptionally vulnerable to cyclones, relative sea-level rise, saline intrusion, floods, landslides, heat waves and droughts, exacerbated by environmental degradation. NbS have been implemented in Bangladesh, but there is no synthesis of the outcomes in a form accessible to policymakers. We therefore conducted a systematic review on the effectiveness of NbS for addressing climate and natural hazards, and the outcomes for other sustainable development goals. Research encompasses protection, restoration and participatory management of mangroves, terrestrial forests and wetlands, as well as conservation agriculture and agro-forestry, but there is an evidence gap for urban green infrastructure. There is robust evidence that, if well-designed, these NbS can be effective in reducing exposure to natural disasters, adapting to climate change and reducing greenhouse gas emissions while empowering marginalized groups, reducing poverty, supporting local economies and enhancing biodiversity. However, we found short-term trade-offs with local needs, e.g. through over-harvesting and conversion of ecosystems to aquaculture or agriculture. To maximize NbS benefits while managing trade-offs, we identified four enabling factors: support for NbS in government policies; participatory delivery involving all stakeholders; strong and transparent governance; and provision of secure finance and land tenure, in line with international guidelines. More systematic monitoring of NbS project outcomes is also needed. Bangladesh has an opportunity to lead the way in showing how high quality NbS can be deployed at landscape scale to tackle sustainable development challenges in low to middle income countries, supporting a Green Economic Recovery. Our evidence base highlights the value of protecting irreplaceable natural assets such as mangroves, terrestrial forests and wetlands, and the non-market benefits they deliver, in national planning policies.",https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fenvs.2021.737659/pdf,

Overall, SM2RAIN-ASCAT dominates SM2RAIN-CCI across all climate regions, with average percentage improvements in bias (27.01% in humid, 5.94% in arid, and 6.05% in hyper-arid), ubRMSE (19.61% in humid, 20.16% in arid, and 25.56% in hyper-arid), Theil’s U (9.80% in humid, 28.80% in arid, and 26.83% in hyper-arid), MSEs (24.55% in humid, 13.83% in arid, and 8.22% in hyper-arid), MSEr (19.41% in humid, 29.20% in arid, and 24.14% in hyper-arid) and KGE score (5.26% in humid, 28.12% in arid, and 24.72% in hyper-arid). Higher uncertainties were depicted in heavy and intense precipitation seasons, i.e., monsoon and pre-monsoon. Average values of statistical metrics during monsoon season for SM2RAIN-CCI (SM2RAIN-ASCAT) were 20.90% (17.82%), 10.52 mm/day (8.61 mm/day), 0.47 (0.43), and 0.47 (0.55) for bias, ubRMSE, Theil’s U, and KGE score, respectively. TMPA outperformed SM2RAIN-based products across all climate regions.

Warming of the climate system in recent decades is evident from increase in global average air and ocean temperatures, widespread melting of snow and ice, and rising global sea level. The hydrological cycle is intimately linked with changes in atmospheric temperature and radiation balance. A warmer climate may lead to intensification of the hydrological cycle, resulting in higher rates of evaporation and increase of liquid precipitation. These processes, in association with a shifting pattern of precipitation, may affect the spatial and temporal distribution of runoff, soil moisture, groundwater reserves etc. and may increase the frequency of droughts and floods. Agricultural demand, particularly for irrigation water is considered more sensitive to climate change. A change in field-level climate may alter the need and timing of irrigation. Increased dryness may lead to increased demand, but demand may be reduced if soil moisture content rises at critical times of the year. It is projected that most irrigated areas in India would require more water around 2025 and global net irrigation requirements would increase relative to the situation without climate change by 3.5–5% by 2025, and 6–8% by 2075. The effect of climate change on water resources may be mitigated through better water harvesting through the creation of micro-storage facilities in watersheds. These would not only provide supplemental irrigation but also recharge the groundwater aquifers.",https://epubs.icar.org.in/index.php/IJAgS/article/download/41421/18462,

It also offers adaptation capacity needs as well as water and food security in the southern African region. In this study, evidence for climate change impacts and adaptation strategies in rainfed agricultural systems is explored through modeling predictions of crop yield, soil moisture and excess water for potential harvesting. The study specifically presents the results of climate change impacts under rainfed conditions for maize, sorghum and sunflower using soil-water-crop model simulations, integrated based on daily inputs of rainfall and evapotranspiration disaggregated from GCM scenarios. The research targets a vast farming region dominated by heavy clay soils where rainfed agriculture is a dominant practice. The potential for improving soil water productivity and improved water harvesting have been explored as ways of climate change mitigation and adaptation measures. This can be utilized to explore and design appropriate conservation agriculture and adaptation practices in similar agro-ecological environments, and create opportunities for outscaling for much wider areas.

It poses serious threats on vulnerable continents, people and livelihoods globally. However, little information is available on how the specific climate threat is impacting people’s livelihoods and water resources on different temporal and spatial scales in Nigeria basins. This study aimed at investigating household vulnerability and adaptation to water stress induced by climate variability on a downstream Kaduna River basin with the goal of supporting/facilitating climate change adaptation. The research analyzed hydro-climatic data and employed vulnerability-based framework consistent with stakeholders’ participatory approach, within the context of current climate conditions experienced, and/or water stress conditions already affecting household livelihoods in six communities at three study sites; Shiroro, Gbako and Lavun, and adaptive strategies engaged to deal with water stress. Findings revealed that households have been exposed and experienced changes in water availability through variations in rainfall, temperature and runoff. Consequently, these changes have impacted on food production and livelihoods. Households have individually and collectively employed adaptation techniques which are reactive, short-term indigenous coping strategies usually adopted during periods of stress to minimize water-related vulnerabilities. The study demonstrated how an understanding of the local household vulnerabilities will enable the recognition of early indicators of water stress in addition to the occurrence of extreme events. Overall, households’ vulnerability decreased from one village to another due to differences in sensitivity to stress, access to resources and local institutional capacity. Resilience of households can be increased through early warning system during flood events, providing access to water from rainwater harvesting techniques, and integration of climate change adaptation into policies regarding development initiatives especially in the area of agriculture.",http://www.scirp.org/journal/PaperDownload.aspx?paperID=76112,

These processes require suitable low‐cost starting material. One potential material assessed here is the oat hull. Its overall chemical composition has so far not been fully characterized. Furthermore, it is not known how it is affected by extreme weather events. Oat hulls (Kerstin and Galant varieties) grown during ‘normal’ weather years (2016 and 2017) are compared to the harvest of the warmer and drier year (2018). Standard methods for determination of plant chemical composition, with focus on carbohydrate composition, are utilized. Oat hulls grown in ‘normal’ weather conditions (2017) are rich in lignocellulose (84%), consisting of 35% hemicellulose, 25% lignin and 23% cellulose. Arabinoxylan was found to be the major biopolymer (32%). However, this composition is greatly influenced by weather variations during the oat growth phase. A lignocellulose reduction of 25% was recorded in the warmer and drier 2018 harvest. Additionally, a 6.6‐fold increase in starch content, a four‐fold increase in protein content and a 60% decrease in phenolic content was noted. Due to its high lignocellulose composition, with an exceptionally large hemicellulose fraction, the chemical composition of oat hulls is unique among agricultural by‐products. However, this characteristic is significantly reduced when grown in warmer and drier weather, which could compromise its suitability for use in a successful biorefinery.",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1111/plb.13171,

The increase of agricultural economy of the country is extremely exposed to weather and climate effects. Decrease of crop production in dry areas is linked to the water (runoff, evaporation and overindulgence use). The objective of this manuscript is to review the status of rainwater harvesting (RWH) technology and practices in sustaining agricultural production in Ethiopia. The in-situ and ex-situ RWH techniques have shown a significant impact on improved soil moisture, runoff and ground water recharge and increased agricultural production, which, in turn, reduce risks and deliver positive impacts on other ecosystems. The implementation of thousands of indicated above structures has been also confined with a range of problems and challenges. In the eastern part of Ethiopia, water shortage and lack of improved technology were the main problems, therefore practicing water harvesting and supplying improved water harvesting technologies providing extended service regularly for farmers should be practiced in the future.

Finally, AFLA-maize, a mechanistic model, is applied to determine the impact of these projected changes on the aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) contamination risk. We find that Malawi's climate is projected to get warmer (by 1–2.5°C) and drier (reduction of 0–4% in annual rainfall levels) in all regions, although some uncertainty remains around the changes in precipitation levels. These climatic changes are expected to shorten the growing season for maize, bringing the harvest date forward by between 10 and 25 days for the short-development variety and between 25 and 65 days for the long-development variety. These changes are also projected to make the pre-harvest conditions for Malawian maize more favorable for AFB1 contamination and risk maps for the studied conditions were drawn.

The trial was replicated in three sites located in the Czech Republic with distinctly different soils and climates which were judged to be respectively favorable, unfavorable and marginal for growing black poplar. In the marginal and unfavorable sites the planting density was 2222 trees ha-1 and in optimal conditions 7407 trees ha-1. The aim of the trial was: (1) to test the performance of black poplar clones as a possible replacement for commercial hybrid poplars in areas where the genetic integrity of wild black poplar populations is under threat; (2) to test the range of conditions in which it is possible to grow black poplar and its suitability for utilizing marginal agricultural land; and (3) to measure the potential yield of black poplar clones grown in these conditions. During four harvests at three-year intervals, the following parameters were measured: plant mortality, number of shoots, thickness of shoots, the total cross-sectional area (TCA) of all shoots, the dry matter weight of individual plants (DMIP) and the dry matter yields per hectare. The differences observed between “NE-42” and the best black poplar clone decreased as conditions became more favorable. During the fourth harvest at the unfavorable site for growing poplars, the yield of dry biomass was 11.7 t ha-1 yr-1 for “NE-42” compared to 3.7 t ha-1 yr-1 for the best black poplar clone. In marginal conditions the yields were 11.8 and 9.9 t ha-1 yr-1 respectively, and in the favorable conditions there was no statistically significant difference, being 15.9 and 13.2 t ha-1 yr-1, respectively. The higher yield of “NE-42” was due to the higher proportion of thicker shoots or, alternatively, lower plant mortality. The observed TCA was highly correlated with DMIP (rs = 0.87) and dry biomass yield (rs = 0.48). It was demonstrated that black poplar can be successfully grown in marginal conditions on land which otherwise would not be especially suitable for agricultural production, and also in areas where the genetic purity of native populations of black poplar is threatened by the spread of commercially grown hybrid poplars.",https://iforest.sisef.org/pdf/?id=ifor1162-007,

We defined wheat vulnerability as the degree to which a wheat production system is likely to experience yield loss due to a perturbation or drought hazard. Wheat vulnerability in a given region is thus the yield loss divided by the drought hazard index (DHI). By simulating a variety of wheat yield losses and associated DHIs, wheat drought vulnerability curves can be developed. We propose that agricultural systems be considered uniform within each wheat-planting region and different in different regions, according to territorial differentiation, when regionalized vulnerability curves are built. Based on this principle, a detailed regional crop calendar was improved, and optimized wheat varieties were refined that can differentiate agricultural systems within wheat-planting regions. The crop calendar was improved based on the assumption that local farmers have perfect knowledge in selecting sowing and harvesting dates. The wheat varieties were optimized by adjusting the genetic parameters of wheat in the EPIC model using the Shuffled Complex Evolution algorithm–University of Arizona (SCE-UA) method. Based on these improvements and innovations, the precision of most vulnerability curves was improved, and the curves were compared favorably to those observed in previous studies related to differences in the genetic character of wheat, the crop calendar, environmental conditions, and other relevant factors. Differences within each region were smaller than differences between regions. More detailed wheat vulnerability curves allow for the assessment of expected wheat yield loss and also allow for a high level of precision in an evaluation, at a variety of scales, of risk of wheat subject to drought. The proposed approach to building regionalized vulnerability curves has the potential to be the basis for crop drought vulnerability curves in different geographical areas at multiple scales.",http://ir.igsnrr.ac.cn/bitstream/311030/39017/1/Yue-2015-An%20EPIC%20model-based.pdf,

Large uncertainty exists in this utilization, obstructing its capacity as a tool to devise adaptation strategies. Increasing focus has been given to sources of uncertainties for climate scenarios, input‐data, and model, but uncertainties due to model parameter or calibration are still unknown. Here, we use publicly available geographical data sets as input to the Environmental Policy Integrated Climate model (EPIC) for simulating global‐gridded maize yield. Impacts of climate change are assessed up to the year 2099 under a climate scenario generated by HadEM2‐ES under RCP 8.5. We apply five strategies by shifting one specific parameter in each simulation to calibrate the model and understand the effects of calibration. Regionalizing crop phenology or harvest index appears effective to calibrate the model for the globe, but using various values of phenology generates pronounced difference in estimated climate impact. However, projected impacts of climate change on global maize production are consistently negative regardless of the parameter being adjusted. Different values of model parameter result in a modest uncertainty at global level, with difference of the global yield change less than 30% by the 2080s.

In order to study the distribution of this risk factor, an ecological epidemiological study was conducted associating the rates of deaths and hospital admissions for respiratory diseases, for each municipality in the State, with the exposure to the pre-harvesting burning of sugarcane straw. A Bayesian multivariate regression model, controlled for the possible effects of socioeconomic and climate (temperature, humidity, and rainfall) variations, has been used. The effect on health was measured by the standardized mortality and morbidity ratio. The measures of exposure to the pre-harvesting burning used were: percentage of the area of sugarcane harvested with burning, average levels of aerosol, and number of outbreaks of burning. The autocorrelation between data was controlled using a neighborhood matrix. It was observed that the increase in the number of outbreaks of burning was significantly associated with higher rates of hospital admissions for respiratory disease in children under five years old.

Plants, fungi, and animals harvested from forests have long provided multiple benefits—for nutrition, health, income, and cultural purposes. Across the globe, the main element of “forest management” has been industrial wood production. Sourcing food from forests has been not even an afterthought but a subordinate activity that just happens and is largely invisible in official statistics. For many people, forests ensure a secure supply of essential foods and vital nutrients. For others, foraging forests for food offers cultural, recreational, and diversified culinary benefits. Increasingly, these products are perceived by consumers as being more “natural” and healthier than food from agricultural production. Forest-and wild-sourced products increasingly are being used as key ingredients in multiple billion dollar industries due to rising demand for “natural” food production. Consumer trends demonstrate growing interests in forest food gathering that involves biological processes and new forms of culturally embedded interactions with the natural world. Further, intensifying calls to “re-orient” agricultural production provides opportunities to expand the roles of forests in food production; to reset food systems by integrating forests and trees. We use examples of various plants, such as baobab, to explore ways forests and trees provide for food security and nutrition and illustrate elements of a framework to encourage integration of forests and trees. Forests and trees provide innovative opportunities and technological and logistical challenges to expand food systems and transition to a bioeconomy.

Some papers addressed the contentious issue of predator control (e.g., gamebirds in Great Britain), while others presented data regarding how human activities influenced animal behavior (e.g., pink footed geese, Anser brachyrhynchus; and red deer, Cervus elaphus, in Germany). The papers presented at the congress show how human activities affect the distributions and dynamics of wildlife populations and also change the behavior of some species. Wildlife causes social and economic conflicts by damaging agricultural and forest resources, bringing about traffic collisions, and creating problems for residents in urban areas; while many are increasingly distant from nature and may not accept the presence of wildlife others may actively encourage the presence of wild animals. The first paper in this volume, by Cahill et al. (2012), analyzes the management challenges of the increasing abundance of wild boar in the peri–urban area of Barcelona. This conflict has arisen in other large cities in Europe and elsewhere. The presence of the species causes problems for many residents, to such an extent that it is considered a pest in these areas. Wild boar habituation has not only been facilitated by population expansion, but also by the attitudes of some citizens who encourage their presence by direct feeding. This leads to wild boar behavior modification and also promotes an increase in the fertility rate of habituated females, which are significantly heavier than non–habituated females. Public attitudes regarding the species and harvesting methods (at present most specimens are removed by live capture and subsequently sacrificed) are highlighted as one of the key factors in the management of the conflict. The second paper provides an example of how the distribution of irrigated croplands influences wild boar roadkills in NW Spain (Colino–Rabanal et al., 2012). By modeling the spatial distribution of wild boar collisions with vehicles and using generalized additive models based on GIS, the authors show that the number of roadkills is higher in maize croplands than in forested areas. This factor is the main explanatory variable in the model. The paper provides an excellent example of how the synergies of diverse human elements in the landscape (maize croplands and roads in this case) affect the location and dimensions of these types of conflicts. The third and final paper, by Belotti et al. (2012), addresses the effects of tourism on Eurasian lynx movements and prey usage at Sumava National Park in the Czech Republic. The monitoring of 5 GPS–collared lynxes and analyses of data regarding habitat features suggests that human disturbance (proximity of roads and tourist trails) can modify the presence of lynxes during the day close to the site where they have hidden a prey item, such as an ungulate, that can provide them with food for several days. In such cases, adequate management of tourism development must involve a commitment to species conservation. The analyses and understanding of all these phenomena and the design of successful wildlife management strategies and techniques used to mitigate the conflicts require a good knowledge base that considers information both about wildlife and human attitudes. The papers presented stress the importance of spatial analyses of the interactions and their relationship with landscape features and the location of human activities. Species distribution and abundance are related to important habitat variables such as provision of shelter, food, comfortable spaces, and an appropriate climate. Therefore, it is essential to analyze these data adequately to predict where conflicts are most likely to arise and to design successful mitigation strategies. The second key factor for adequate management of human–wildlife interactions is to monitor system change. An analysis of the variety of data on population dynamics, hunting, wildlife collisions, and wildlife presence in urban areas would provide a basis for adaptive management. In this respect, in the plenary session, Steve Redpath mentioned the importance of the wildlife biologist’s attitude when interpreting and drawing conclusions from recorded data and stressed the importance of conducting clear, relevant, and transparent science for participants involved in the management decision process, which often involves a high number of stakeholders. All of the papers addressing the problems associated with human wildlife interactions were characterized by a common theme. Regardless of the specific nature of the problem, the public was generally divided on how the problem should be addressed. A particularly sensitive theme was that of population control methods, especially when conflicts are located in peri–urban areas. Several presenters acknowledged that public participation was necessary if a solution was to be reached. Some suggested, as have other authors (Heydon et al., 2010), that a legislative framework may be needed to reconcile human and wildlife interests. However, each problem that was presented appeared to involve multiple stakeholders with different opinions. Solving these kinds of problems is not trivial. Social factors strongly influence perceptions of human–wildlife conflicts but the methods used to mitigate these conflicts often take into account technical aspects but not people’s attitudes. A new, more innovative and interdisciplinary approach to mitigation is needed to allow us 'to move from conflict towards coexistence' (Dickman, 2010). Other authors also mentioned the importance of planning interventions that optimize the participation of experts, policy makers, and affected communities and include the explicit, systematic, and participatory evaluation of the costs and benefits of alternative interventions (Treves et al., 2009). One technique that has been used to solve problems like these is termed Structured Decision Making (SDM). This technique was developed by the U.S. Geological Survey and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. As described by Runge et al. (2009), the process is 'a formal application of common sense for situations too complex for the informal use of common sense', and provides a rational framework and techniques to aid in prescriptive decision making. Fundamentally, the process entails defining a problem, deciding upon the objectives, considering the alternative actions and the consequences for each, using the available science to develop a model (the plan), and then making the decision how to implement (Runge et al., 2009). Although complex, SDM uses a facilitator to guide stakeholders through the process to reach a mutually agreed–upon plan of action. It is clear that human–wildlife interactions are inherently complex because many stakeholders are usually involved. A rational approach that incorporates all interested parties would seem to be a productive way of solving these kinds of problems.

Sequestration of soil organic carbon (SOC) on cropland has been proposed as a climate change mitigation strategy to reduce global greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations in the atmosphere, which in particular is needed to achieve the targets proposed in the Paris Agreement to limit the increase in atmospheric temperature to well below 2 ∘C. We analyze the historical evolution and future development of cropland SOC using the global process-based biophysical model LPJmL, which was recently extended by a detailed representation of tillage practices and residue management (version 5.0-tillage2). We find that model results for historical global estimates for SOC stocks are at the upper end of available literature, with ∼2650 Pg C of SOC stored globally in the year 2018, ∼170 Pg C of which is stored in cropland soils. In future projections, assuming no further changes in current cropland patterns and under four different management assumptions with two different climate forcings, RCP2.6 and RCP8.5, results suggest that agricultural SOC stocks decline in all scenarios, as the decomposition of SOC outweighs the increase in carbon inputs into the soil from altered management practices. Different climate change scenarios, as well as assumptions on tillage management, play a minor role in explaining differences in SOC stocks. The choice of tillage practice explains between 0.2 % and 1.3 % of total cropland SOC stock change in the year 2100. Future dynamics in cropland SOC are most strongly controlled by residue management: whether residues are left on the field or harvested. We find that on current cropland, global cropland SOC stocks decline until the end of the century by only 1.0 % to 1.4 % if residue retention management systems are generally applied and by 26.7 % to 27.3 % in the case of residue harvest. For different climatic regions, increases in cropland SOC can only be found for tropical dry, warm temperate moist, and warm temperate dry regions in management systems that retain residues.",https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-12-1037-2021,

The material for the analyses was data from 2015–2017 collected on 15 farms located in the Wielkopolska region (Poland) and growing maize for grain in three tillage systems: conventional, reduced, and no-tillage. The life-cycle assessment and life-cycle costing methodologies were applied to assess the GHG emissions and costs associated with the grain maize production in the stages from “cradle-to-farm gate”, i.e., from obtaining raw materials and producing means for agricultural production, through the processes of maize cultivation to grain harvesting. The calculated values of the carbon footprint indicator for maize production in conventional, reduced, and no-tillage systems were 2347.4, 2353.4, and 1868.7 CO2 eq. ha−1, respectively. The largest source of GHG emissions was the use of nitrogen fertilizers. Non-inversion tillage with cover crops and leaving a large amount of crop residues in the field increased the sequestration of organic carbon and contributed to a significant reduction of the carbon footprint in maize production.

Vegetables are an essential part of daily human consumption and thus have importance among all agricultural crops. The human population is increasing daily, so there is a need for alternative ways which can be helpful in maximizing the harvestable yield of vegetables. The increase in temperature directly affects the plants’ biochemical and molecular processes; having a significant impact on quality and yield. Breeding for climate-resilient crops with good yields takes a long time and lots of breeding efforts. However, with the advent of new omics technologies, such as genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics, the efficiency and efficacy of unearthing information on pathways associated with high-temperature stress resilience has improved in many of the vegetable crops. Besides omics, the use of genomics-assisted breeding and new breeding approaches such as gene editing and speed breeding allow creation of modern vegetable cultivars that are more resilient to high temperatures. Collectively, these approaches will shorten the time to create and release novel vegetable varieties to meet growing demands for productivity and quality.

The planting was transitional during the first year after planting and was certified organic during fruit production (2008–16). Treatments included plantingmethod (on raised beds or flat ground), fertilizer source (granular feather meal or fish solubles), and rate (‘‘low’’ and ‘‘high’’ rates of 29 and 57 kg·ha N during establishment, increased incrementally as the planting matured to 73 and 140 kg·ha N, respectively), mulch [sawdust, yard debris compost topped with sawdust (compost + sawdust), or black, woven polyethylene groundcover (weed mat)], and cultivar (‘Duke’ and ‘Liberty’). Mulches were replenished, as needed, and weeds were controlled throughout the study. Raised beds resulted in greater yield than flat ground during the establishment years but had less effect on yield once the plants weremature. After 9 years, cumulative yield was 22% greater on raised beds than on flat ground in ‘Liberty’ but was unaffected by plantingmethod in ‘Duke’. Cumulative yield was also 10% greater with feather meal than with fish solubles, on average, and 4% greater with the low rate than with the high rate of fertilizer. ‘Duke’ was particularly sensitive to fertilizer source and produced 35% less yield overall with fish solubles than with feather meal. By contrast, there was relatively little effect of fertilizer source or rate on yield in ‘Liberty’. In five of 9 years, yield was 8% to 20% greater with weedmat than with sawdust or compost + sawdust. Mulch type had no effect on cumulative yield of ‘Duke’, but cumulative yield of ‘Liberty’ was 11% greater with weedmat than with sawdust or compost + sawdust. Soil temperature was warmer under weedmat than under sawdust, and plants on raised beds covered with weed mat required more irrigation than those grown on flat ground mulched with sawdust. ‘Duke’ produced heavier, larger, and firmer berries with lower total soluble solids (TSS) than ‘Liberty’. However, other treatment effects on berry quality were relatively small and inconsistent. For example, berry weight was greater on raised beds than on flat ground, on average, but only by 3% (0.06 g/berry). Plants on raised beds also produced berries with slightly lower TSS than those on flat ground (15.2%and 15.7%, respectively, in ‘Liberty’, and 13.1% and 13.3%, respectively in ‘Duke’). There was no effect of fertilizer source or rate on TSS in ‘Liberty’ (15.5% on average), whereas in ‘Duke’, TSS was highest when fertilized at the high (13.7%) or low (13.4%) rate of fish, and was lower when using feather meal (12.9% and 13.1% for low and high rate, respectively). Plants fertilized with fish produced firmer fruit than with feather meal in five of the 7 years in which the measurements were taken. Also, fertilization with the higher rate of either product increased berry firmness comparedwith the low rate in six of the 7 years. The impact ofmulch was inconsistent through the study period. On average, ‘Duke’ berries were softest when fertilized with the low (173 g·mm deflection) and high (176 g·mm) rates of feathermeal andwere the firmest with the high rate of fish (182 g·mm). In ‘Liberty’, the low rate of feather meal produced softer fruit (157 g·mm) than the other fertilizer treatments (162 g·mm on average).When this study was initiated in 2006, the most common organic production system in this region was raised beds with sawdust mulch and fertilizing with a high rate of fish solubles. For this production system, yield for mature plants in our study (2014L16) was the equivalent of 8.9L12.3 t·ha in ‘Duke’ and 11.8L23.7 t·ha in ‘Liberty’. However, when plants were grown on raised beds with weed mat and fertilized with the high rate of feather meal, yield increased to 10.2L19.3 t·ha, depending on year, in ‘Duke’. By contrast, there was little effect of production system on yield of mature ‘Liberty’ plants. These yields, particularly for the best-performing treatment combination in ‘Duke’, are similar to what are observed in commercial conventional fields or organic farms using similar management practices. Our results showed that choice of organic production system can have significant impact on yield and economic costs and returns. The Pacific northwestern United States is an important growing region for northern highbush blueberry (Vaccinium corymbosum L.). According to recent U.S. surveys, this region accounted for 20% of the total conventional area of highbush blueberry (U.S. Department of Agriculture, 2014) and 49% of the total organic area (U.S. Department of Agriculture, 2010). Organic blueberry production has increased in this region because of strong consumer demand, price premiums of 20% to 200% over conventional fruit, and a dry summer climate, which reduces the potential incidence for weeds, insect pests, and leaf and fruit diseases (DeVetter et al., 2015; FernandezSalvador et al., 2017; Strik, 2014). However, there were some challenges specific to organic production that needed to be addressed, including greater production costs and inputs (particularly for fertilization and weedmanagement), limited Organic Materials Review Institute (OMRI)-approved options for disease and insect control, and potential or perceived reduced yields of organic plantings and associated returns (Strik, 2014).

HORTSCIENCE VOL. 52(9) SEPTEMBER 2017 1201 highbush blueberry in North America were based on anecdotal information (Krewer and Walker, 2006; Kuepper and Diver, 2004). There was little research at that point comparing organic production strategies in blueberry, and most of the production research done in conventional blueberry systems was not applicable to organic systems. Highbush blueberry is typically planted on raised beds. Raised beds improve soil drainage (Strik, 2007), limit compaction (Magdoff and Van Es, 2010), reduce incidence of root pathogens such as Phytophthora (Bryla and Linderman, 2007), and improve efficiency of machine harvest (Strik and Buller, 2002). However, planting on flat ground can be beneficial to root growth in southern highbush blueberry (complex hybrids based largely on V. corymbosum and V. darrowiiCamp.) likely due to increased soil moisture and reduced soil temperature during the fruiting season (Spiers, 1995). Furthermore, mechanical weed-control methods are more effective on flat ground than on raised beds (Sciarappa et al., 2008; B. Strik, personal observation). Weed management is critical for successful production of blueberries (Pritts et al., 1992; Strik et al., 1993), but chemical herbicide options available for organic systems are expensive and limited and usually are not very effective on established perennial weeds (Julian et al., 2012; Larco et al., 2013a). Other forms of weed control such as organic mulches, propane flaming, string trimming, and hand weeding are often used instead (Burkhard et al., 2009; Granatstein and Mullinix, 2008; Krewer et al., 2009; Sciarappa et al., 2008). Organic mulches provide additional benefits in highbush blueberry, including increased yield and plant growth (Clark and Moore, 1991; Goulart et al., 1997; Karp et al., 2006; Kozinski, 2006; Krewer et al., 2009; Savage, 1942; White, 2006). Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii M.) sawdust is commonly used to mulch blueberry plantings in Oregon, Washington, and British Columbia, but sawdust has become expensive in the region (Julian et al., 2011a), and it tends to immobilize a considerable amount of the N applied from fertilizers (White, 2006). Some growers are using compost in addition to sawdust to provide additional nutrients and organic matter (Gale et al., 2006; Larco et al., 2014). Municipal yard debris compost is readily available in many production regions and may be suitable for commercial blueberry production (Sullivan et al., 2014). Weed mat (perforated landscape fabric) is approved for use as a weed barrier by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Organic National Program (USDA-AMS-NOP, 2011), and because of economic advantages, it has been adopted by both organic and conventional blueberry growers (Julian et al., 2012; Strik and Vance, 2017). However, increased soil temperature under the weed mat can reduce plant growth (Neilsen et al., 2003;Williamson et al., 2006) and yield (Krewer et al., 2009). Larco et al. (2013a) reported that northern highbush blueberry grew less with weed mat than with sawdust mulch by the end of the first two growing seasons; however, the plants had greater yield with weed mat in the second year, which was the first season of fruit production. In addition to weed management, availability and affordability of fertilizers are of critical importance for the economical production of organic blueberry (Strik, 2014). Fish solubles and feather meal are common fertilizers used by organic blueberry growers. Fish solubles are typically applied by fertigation through the drip irrigation system, especially when weed mat is used and other application methods are less practical or more expensive. Feather meal is a granular product applied to the soil surface. Both fertilizers mineralize readily on application and quickly release N and other nutrients (Bar",https://journals.ashs.org/downloadpdf/journals/hortsci/52/9/article-p1201.pdf,

Secondary data on production statistics, rural population, climate variables, prices and nominal exchange rate for the period 1978–2009 are used. Results for estimated short- and long-run models indicate that cassava yield is affected by both ‘normal’ climate variables and within-season rainfall variability. An inverse relationship is found between area harvested and yield of cassava, but a significant positive and elastic effect of labour availability on yield in the long run. Increasing within-lean-season rainfall variability and high lean-season mean temperature are detrimental to cassava yields, while increasing main-season rainfall and mean-temperature enhance cassava yields. Through Granger Causality tests, a bilateral causality is found between area harvested and yield of cassava, and four unidirectional causalities from labour availability, real producer price ratio between yam and cassava, main-season rainfall and lean-season mean temperature to cassava yields. Based on the findings from this study, investment in low-cost irrigation facilities and water harvesting is recommended to enhance the practice of supplemental irrigation.

Biochar application, in combination with plant growth promoting rhizobacteria with the ability to solubilize nutrients, can be an effective strategy for improving soil health and nutrient availability to crops under these conditions. Experiments were planned to evaluate the impact of biochar obtained from different sources in combination with acid-producing, nutrient-solubilizing Bacillus sp. ZM20 on soil biological properties and growth of maize (Zea mays L.) crops under natural conditions. Various biochar treatments, viz. wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) straw biochar, Egyptian acacia (Vachellia nilotica L.) biochar, and farm-yard manure biochar with and without Bacillus sp. ZM20, were used along with control. Soil used for pot and field trials was sandy loam in texture with poor water holding capacity and deficient in nutrients. Results of the pot trial showed that fresh and dry biomass, 1000 grain weight, and grain yield was significantly improved by application of biochar of different sources with and without Bacillus sp. ZM20. Application of biochar along with Bacillus sp. ZM20 also improved soil biological properties, i.e., soil organic matter, microbial biomass carbon, ammonium, and nitrate nitrogen. It was also observed that a combined application of biochar with Bacillus sp. ZM20 was more effective than a separate application of biochar. The results of wheat straw biochar along with Bacillus sp. ZM20 were better as compared to farm-yard manure biochar and Egyptian acacia biochar. Maximum increase (25.77%) in grain yield was observed in the treatment where wheat straw biochar (0.2%) was applied in combination with Bacillus sp. ZM20. In conclusion, combined application of wheat straw biochar (0.2%) inoculated with Bacillus sp. ZM20 was the most effective treatment in improving the biological soil properties, plant growth, yield, and quality of maize crop as compared to all other treatments.",https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4395/10/7/1055/pdf?version=1595331334,

Lahan pertanian eksisting penghasil bahan pangan terutama sawah dan lahan kering menjadi tumpuan harapan untuk memenuhi kebutuhan pangan 258,7 juta jiwa penduduk pada tahun 2017. Usaha pencapaian swasembada berkelanjutan dihadapkan pada (i) peningkatan jumlah penduduk sekitar 3,4 juta jiwa setiap tahun, (ii) konversi lahan sawah ke non pertanian dengan laju sekitar 96.500 ha tahun-1, sementara laju perluasan lahan sawah hanya sekitar 20.000-30.000 ha tahun-1, dan (iii) perubahan iklim global yang menyebabkan peningkatan intensitas dan frekuensi kejadian iklim ekstrim berupa kekeringan, kebanjiran, longsor, yang selanjutnya meningkatkan intensitas serangan hama/penyakit tanaman. Upaya dan strategi untuk mengatasi permasalahan tersebut diantaranya melalui, pertama, intensifikasi dengan inovasi teknologi pada 4 juta ha sawah irigasi teknis, 4,1 juta ha lahan sawah sub-optimal (tadah hujan, irigasi sederhana, sawah rawa) melalui perbaikan saluran irigasi dan sistem drainase, pemupukan berimbang, pengembangan varietas unggul, dan peningkatan Indeks Panen dari 1 menjadi 1,5. Kedua, pengendalian konversi lahan melalui kesepakatan berbagai pemangku kepentingan, kerjasama lintas kementerian/ lembaga serta antara pemerintah dengan swasta dan masyarakat untuk meningkatkan kesadaran akan bahaya konversi lahan terhadap ketahanan pangan, kestabilan sosial, ekonomi dan politik. Ketiga,perluasan areal tanam di lahan perkebunan kelapa sawit muda (5,1 juta ha) dan karet (0,54 juta ha), serta pada perkebunan kelapa (2,15 juta ha). Tersedia varietas toleran naungan untuk padi gogo, jagung dan kedelai untuk mendukung usaha ini. Keempat, perluasan areal pertanian baru untuk tanaman pangan pada lahan potensial di lahan rawa (pasang surut, lebak, dan gambut) dan pada lahan basah non rawa untuk sawah irigasi dan tadah hujan, serta di lahan kering dengan lereng < 15% untuk tegalan. Keempat pendekatan ini diharapkan dapat mewujudkan swasembada pangan secara berkelanjutan.Abstract. Existing agricultural land for food crops, especially paddy fields and upland, is a very essential element for fulfilling the needs of food for258.7 million people in 2017. The efforts to achieve permanent self-sufficiency are challenged by (i) an increase in the population of approximately 3.4 million people each year, (ii) conversion of paddy field to non-agricultural land at a rate of about 96,500 ha year-1, while the rate of paddy field expansion is only about 20,000-30,000 ha year-1, and (iii) global climate change which causes the increase in intensity and frequency of extreme climatic events in the forms of droughts, floods, landslides, that in turns increase the incident of pest/disease attacks. Efforts and strategies are required to overcome them through first, intensification by applying technological innovations on 4 million ha of existing fully irrigated rice fields, 4.1 million ha of sub-optimal rice fields (rainfed, simple irrigation, swampland) with improved irrigation and drainage systems, balanced fertilization, improved varieties, and increased Harvesting Index from 1 to 1.5. Second, control of land conversion by establishing multi-stakeholder agreements, cooperation among related ministerials/institutionals, local governments, private sectors and communities to raise awareness of the risk of land conversion to food security, social, economic and political stability.Third, expansion of rice farming areas into young oil palm (5.1 million ha), rubber (0.54 million ha), as well as on coconut (2.15 million ha) plantations. Shade tolerant varieties are now available for upland rice, maize and soybeans to support this effort. Fourth, expansion of new agricultural areas for food crops on potential lands in swamp land (tidal swamp lands, fresh water swamp land and peat land), as well as on non swamp wetlands for irrigated and rain-fed rice fields, and on upland with slopes of <15% for annual upland crops. These four approaches are believed to enable achievement of sustainable food self-sufficiency. ",http://ejurnal.litbang.pertanian.go.id/index.php/jsl/article/download/8187/6987,

Farmers are required to adopt several measures to thrive, given the observed or expected climate change events. Existing studies about the interaction between climate change the agriculture sector has focused evaluating the bi-directional causal relationships, and identifying adaptation measures, but research on the climate resilience aspect of these adaptation measures is missing, or at best, low. This study aims to fill this gap in knowledge by assessing resilience and contribution to sustainability of farmer-adopted measures aimed at addressing risks posed by climate change. We conduct a systematic review of 95 studies concentrating on climate adaptation by smallholder rural farmers in Nigeria in the period 2010 to 2019. We assess the climate resilience of adaptation measures using the Ifejika-Speranza Resilience Check Toolkit. Our findings show that farmers are using climate-resilient adaptation measures; however, we could not ascertain how these have led to sustainable agricultural systems, since it is not the focus of the current study. Our findings show that majority of the adaptation studies in Nigeria are focused on crop farming subsystem. The major agricultural ecosystems and the broad adaptation areas are: Crop farming (improved soil and land management, crop-specific Innovation, water management practices, climate information services and education, access to finance, and off-farm diversification), livestock farming (improved livestock management systems, improved breeding strategies, sustainable health improvement, proper feed formulation early maturing and heat-resistant bird varieties), and fish farming (water harvesting measures, organic material, quick-maturing varieties).",https://doi.org/10.3934/agrfood.2019.4.967,

According to the latest report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), emissions must be cut by 41–72 % below 2010 levels by 2050 for a likely chance of containing the global mean temperature increase to 2 °C. The AFOLU sector (Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use) contributes roughly a quarter ( ∼  10–12 Pg CO2e yr−1) of the net anthropogenic GHG emissions mainly from deforestation, fire, wood harvesting, and agricultural emissions including croplands, paddy rice, and livestock. In spite of the importance of this sector, it is unclear where the regions with hotspots of AFOLU emissions are and how uncertain these emissions are. Here we present a novel, spatially comparable dataset containing annual mean estimates of gross AFOLU emissions (CO2, CH4, N2O), associated uncertainties, and leading emission sources, in a spatially disaggregated manner (0.5°) for the tropics for the period 2000–2005. Our data highlight the following: (i) the existence of AFOLU emissions hotspots on all continents, with particular importance of evergreen rainforest deforestation in Central and South America, fire in dry forests in Africa, and both peatland emissions and agriculture in Asia; (ii) a predominant contribution of forests and CO2 to the total AFOLU emissions (69 %) and to their uncertainties (98 %); (iii) higher gross fluxes from forests, which coincide with higher uncertainties, making agricultural hotspots appealing for effective mitigation action; and (iv) a lower contribution of non-CO2 agricultural emissions to the total gross emissions (ca. 25 %), with livestock (15.5 %) and rice (7 %) leading the emissions. Gross AFOLU tropical emissions of 8.0 (5.5–12.2) were in the range of other databases (8.4 and 8.0 Pg CO2e yr−1 in FAOSTAT and the Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research (EDGAR) respectively), but we offer a spatially detailed benchmark for monitoring progress in reducing emissions from the land sector in the tropics. The location of the AFOLU hotspots of emissions and data on their associated uncertainties will assist national policy makers, investors, and other decision-makers who seek to understand the mitigation potential of the AFOLU sector.",https://www.biogeosciences.net/13/4253/2016/bg-13-4253-2016.pdf,

Rice farmers have also responded to perceived climate risks with strategies believed to be climate-smart. Farmers’ perception of climate risks is an important first step of determining any action to be taken to counteract the negative effects of climate change on agriculture. Studies on the link between perceived climate risks and farmers’ response strategies are increasing. However, there are limited studies on the determinants of rice farmers’ perception of climate events. The paper therefore examined climate change perception and uptake of climate-smart agriculture in rice production in Ebonyi State, Nigeria using cross-sectional data from 347 rice farmers in an important rice-producing area in Nigeria. Principal component analysis, multivariate probit regression model and descriptive statistics were adopted for data analysis. Perceived climate events include increased rainfall intensity, prolonged dry seasons, frequent floods, rising temperature, severe windstorms, unpredictable rainfall pattern and distribution, late onset rain, and early cessation of rain. Farmers’ socioeconomic, farm and institutional characteristics influenced their perception of climate change. Additionally, rice farmers used a variety of climate-smart practices and technologies to respond to the perceived climate events. Such climate-smart practices include planting improved rice varieties, insurance, planting different crops, livelihood diversification, soil and water conservation techniques, adjusting planting and harvesting dates, irrigation, reliance on climate information and forecasts, planting on the nursery, appropriate application of fertilizer and efficient and effective use of pesticides. These climate-smart agricultural measures were further delineated into five broad packages using principal component analysis. These packages include crop and land management practices, climate-based services and irrigation, livelihood diversification and soil fertility management, efficient and effective use of pesticide and planting on the nursery. High fertilizer costs, lack of access to inputs, insufficient land, insufficient capital, pests and diseases, floods, scorching sun, high labour cost, insufficient climate information, and poor extension services were the barriers to uptake of climate-smart agriculture in rice production. Rice farmers should be supported to implement climate-smart agriculture in rice production in order to achieve the objectives of increased rice productivity and income, food security, climate resilience and mitigation.",https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4433/12/11/1503/pdf?version=1636980741,

Long-term solutions to climate change will require reduction in GHG emissions as well as the removal of large quantities of GHGs from the atmosphere. Natural climate solutions (NCS), i.e., changes in land management, ecosystem restoration, and avoided conversion of habitats, have substantial potential to meet global and national greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction targets and contribute to the global drawdown of GHGs. However, the relative role of NCS to contribute to GHG reduction at subnational scales is not well known. We examined the potential for 12 NCS activities on natural and working lands in Oregon, USA to reduce GHG emissions in the context of the state’s climate mitigation goals. We evaluated three alternative scenarios wherein NCS implementation increased across the applicable private or public land base, depending on the activity, and estimated the annual GHG reduction in carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2e) attributable to NCS from 2020 to 2050. We found that NCS within Oregon could contribute annual GHG emission reductions of 2.7 to 8.3 MMT CO2e by 2035 and 2.9 to 9.8 MMT CO2e by 2050. Changes in forest-based activities including deferred timber harvest, riparian reforestation, and replanting after wildfires contributed most to potential GHG reductions (76 to 94% of the overall annual reductions), followed by changes to agricultural management through no-till, cover crops, and nitrogen management (3 to 15% of overall annual reductions). GHG reduction benefits are relatively high per unit area for avoided conversion of forests (125–400 MT CO2e ha-1). However, the existing land use policy in Oregon limits the current geographic extent of active conversion of natural lands and thus, avoided conversions results in modest overall potential GHG reduction benefits (i.e., less than 5% of the overall annual reductions). Tidal wetland restoration, which has high per unit area carbon sequestration benefits (8.8 MT CO2e ha-1 yr-1), also has limited possible geographic extent resulting in low potential (< 1%) of state-level GHG reduction contributions. However, co-benefits such as improved habitat and water quality delivered by restoration NCS pathways are substantial. Ultimately, reducing GHG emissions and increasing carbon sequestration to combat climate change will require actions across multiple sectors. We demonstrate that the adoption of alternative land management practices on working lands and avoided conversion and restoration of native habitats can achieve meaningful state-level GHG reductions.",https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0230424&type=printable,

Within fruit consumption, the largest expansion has been for organic fruit which increased more than 50% in the 2002-2006 period. The largest expansion of area planted in the 1996-2006 has been for kiwi (29%) and blueberries (20%), while apples (-24%) and sour cherries (-13%) have had the largest reductions. Nearly 50% of the total global volume of fruit is produced by 5 countries: China, USA, Brazil, Italy and Spain. The main producer (China) accounts for 23% of the total. While the main exporters are Spain, USA and Italy, the main importers are Germany, Russia and UK. Demands for the industry have evolved towards quality, food safety and traceability. The industry faces higher productions costs (labor, energy, agrichemicals). The retailers are moving towards consolidation while the customers are changing preferences (food for health). In this context there is greater pressure on growers, processors and retailers. Emerging issues are labor supply, climate change, water availability and sustainability.

Taking these into considerations, this research explores the ‘atlas of the locally adopted strategies’ to cope with adverse effects of cyclone Aila in southwest coastal Bangladesh. Particularly, this research has explored the community level practices in agriculture, housing, water resources, communication and employment generations. An empirical survey was undertaken with 145 respondents by using semi-structured interviews with selected social groups and their households’ assistants. Besides face-to-face interviews, this survey applied group level qualitative assessment methods i.e. FGD (focus group discussion), Social Domain Analyses, and In-depth Interviews to collect the data. Results show that people have started to cultivate saline tolerant rice and vegetables on raised homesteads. They are using dripping irrigation methods. Rain water harvesting and artificial aquifer tube-well have been introduced for water management. The houses’ mud walls have been replaced by or even newly rebuilt with Goran wood or bamboo sticks to save lives. They have formed groups to save money for the next disaster and taken out loans for small entrepreneurship projects. Due to the crises of fodder, pastureland and freshwater, people have started to rear small animals and birds like sheep, goat and pigeon instead of cow and buffalo. New technology based shrimp farming is another new innovation.

Production of these toxic secondary metabolites is closely related to fungal development (Keller et al., 2005; Jamali et al., 2012). Contamination of food, feed and agricultural commodities by aflatoxins poses enormous economic and serious health concerns because these chemicals are highly carcinogenic and can directly influence the structure of DNA. The resulting genetic defects can lead to fetal misdevelopment and miscarriages; aflatoxins are also known to suppress immune systems (Razzaghi-Abyaneh et al., 2013). In a global context, aflatoxin contamination is a constant concern between the 35N and 35S latitude where developing countries are mainly situated. With expanding boundaries of developing countries, aflatoxin contamination has become a persistent problem to those emerging areas (Shams-Ghahfarokhi et al., 2013). The continuing threat by aflatoxin contamination of food, feed and agricultural commodities to the world population has made aflatoxin research one of the most exciting and rapidly developing study areas of microbial toxins. The present research topic includes six review articles, three mini reviews and four original research articles. Contributors highlight current global health issues arising from aflatoxins and aflatoxigenic fungi and cover important aspects of aflatoxin research including contamination of crops, epidemiology, molecular biology and management strategies. Special attention is given to fungus-plant host interactions, biodiversity and biocontrol, sexual recombination in aflatoxigenic aspergilli, potential biomarkers for aflatoxin exposure in humans and safe storage programs. Perrone et al. (2014) reported the expected risk of a shift in aflatoxin problems toward new territories particular in South East of Europe due to increasing average temperatures. Giving an overview on genetic diversity of A. flavus populations in Europe, the authors stressed the importance of selecting stable atoxigenic A. flavus strains as biocontrol agents. In the review of climate change on A. flavus growth and aflatoxin production, Medina et al. (2014) focused on the potential impact of key environmental factors, such as water activity (aw), temperature and atmospheric CO2, and their interactions on ecology, growth and aflatoxin production by the A. flavus both in vitro and on maize. The authors showed that while such interacting abiotic factors have little effect on fungal growth, they however have a significant impact on aflatoxin biosynthetic gene expression and can stimulate the production of aflatoxins. In the insightful mini-review on sexual recombination in aflatoxin-producing Aspergillus species, Moore (2014) concisely summarized the potential negative impact of sexual recombination on the feasibility of using biological controls to reduce aflatoxin contamination of field crops. The author discussed specifically the implication of sexual recombination on the fate of two commercially available biopesticides: AF36 and Afla-Guard®. In the excellent review on the characteristics of A. flavus as well as the biocontrol strategy using non-toxigenic A. flavus strains, Ehrlich (2014) described the current state and outlook of this application in agricultural field. The author concluded that understanding genetic variations among A. flavus strains is critical for developing a robust biocontrol strategy, and it is unlikely that a “one size fits all” strategy will work for preharvest aflatoxin reduction. Host resistance is a very attractive area on aflatoxin research, and various aspects of A. flavus-plant host interaction were investigated with special focuses on mechanisms resistant to fungal growth and aflatoxin production (Dolezal et al., 2014; Fountain et al., 2014; Hruska et al., 2014; Scarpari et al., 2014; Shan and Williams, 2014). In the up-to-date review on environmental influences on aflatoxin production on maize, Fountain et al. (2014) detailed the history of research on this complex interaction and pointed out future directions for elucidating host resistance and susceptibility to A. flavus colonization in relation to abiotic stress such as drought and heat stresses, and oxidative stress in which aflatoxin may function as an antioxidant to the producing fungus. Utilizing an aflatoxigenic Green Fluorescence Protein (GFP) A. flavus strain, Hruska et al. (2014) investigated invasion, colonization and competition in maize kernels by this engineered strain. The authors showed that a decrease in aflatoxin production is correlated with depression of the aflatoxigenic population by the biocontrol strain, AF36, supporting the theory of competitive exclusion. Using a lipidomic approach to investigate A. flavus-maize interactions, Scarpari et al. (2014) suggested that A. flavus elicits the production of oxylipins in host plants, which function as signals for regulating aflatoxins biosynthesis, conidiogenesis and sclerotia formation. Their results highlighted the important role of maize oxylipins in driving secondary metabolism in A. flavus. In the microarray study to identify maize genes expressed during pathogen infection, Dolezal et al. (2014) found that metabolic processes are linked to defense responses, which include physical changes within the kernel as well as a disruption in kernel development. Shan and Williams (2014) provided a concise but clear overview of current knowledge about quantitative trait loci of corn related to aflatoxin contamination and ongoing efforts in the development of resistant corn lines. The authors concluded that the “phenotypic traits/data” established based on transcriptomics and proteomics approaches could be translated into the practices for improving corn resistance. Human exposure to aflatoxins is another challenging but not well studied area. In the concise overview of aflatoxin contamination of foods and related biomarker research, Mohd-Redzwan et al. (2013) described the historical problems related to aflatoxins in Malaysia, and how these problems have influenced the Malaysian population by highlighting the aflatoxin concentrations in basic food products and their comparison with established aflatoxin limits. The authors emphasized the importance of the legislation of law for a more controlled food production, legal enforcement to meet the set regulatory standards, and the improvement of pre and post-harvest techniques to reduce aflatoxin amounts in food and hence to decrease diseases in Malaysian population. In the comprehensive review about using microRNAs as specific molecular biomarkers in populations exposed to aflatoxins and as early markers for evidence of presence of or damage by hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), Valencia-Quintana et al. (2014) described differential expression of microRNAs under specific conditions related not only to chemical and environmental pollutants but also to biological pollutants such as the presence of aflatoxins in humans and animals, and consequently, their influence over HCC. The authors provided findings that are important to toxicological research because microRNAs can be used to predict the toxicity of some compounds and will help to explore new treatments. In a well designed study aimed at enhancing antimycotic activities of known antifungal chemicals by natural compounds, Kim et al. (2014) successfully increased chemosensitization of a kresoxim methyl (Kre-Me), a natural fungicide from strobilurin class by chemically-synthesized benzo analogs. The authors found that among tested benzo analogs, octylgallate (OG) inhibits both growth and aflatoxin production by toxigenic aspergilli more efficiently. The study provided good evidence of remarkable synergism between OG and Kre-Me, which enhances the effectiveness of Kre-Me considerably. The efficient chemosensitizing capability of OG in increasing the efficacy of Kre-Me could reduce effective dosages of strobilurins and alleviate negative side effects associated with the current antifungal treatment. Finally, as one of the most important and practical issues on aflatoxin research, aflatoxin prevention and elimination, Villers (2014) presented laboratory and field data on an Ultra Hermetic™ storage system, which creates an unbreatheable atmosphere through insect and microorganism respiration alone, in preventing the exponential production and accumulation of aflatoxins. This system is proven useful during multi-month post-harvest safe storage tests of maize, rice and peanuts in hot, humid countries. The author further stressed the need for research on post-harvest protection against aflatoxin contamination by determining the frequency at which excessive aflatoxin levels are reached in the field vs. after months of post-harvest storage using this system. In conclusion, this research topic opens exciting perspectives on global health issues related to aflatoxins in the food chain and on the development of suitable strategies for preventing toxigenic fungal growth in field and storage, thereby reducing or eliminating subsequent aflatoxin contamination of our food supplies.",https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2014.00420,

The effects of location and planting date on the fresh yield of several cultivars of Asian greens (Brassica rapa L.), lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.), and spinach (Spinacia oleracea L.) were examined at Moscow, ID/Pullman, WA, and Vancouver, WA, a cold temperate climate and a mild marine climate, respectively. In Winter 2005–06, 20 cultivars were evaluated and in Winter 2006–07 a subset of 12 cultivars were evaluated. Location impacted yield, and higher yields overall were attained at Vancouver than at Moscow/Pullman, likely as a result of more consistent, warmer soil and air temperatures as well as increasing irradiance in February and March at Vancouver. Asian green cultivars had the highest overall yield resulting from faster growth compared with spinach and lettuce cultivars at both locations. Although most lettuce cultivars grew throughout the winter, further research is needed to identify the most suitable cultivars, seeding dates, and planting densities to optimize winter production of this crop and for Asian greens and spinach. Planting date influenced yields with the highest yields obtained for the third planting date for all trials except at Moscow/Pullman in the second year. Overall, this research suggests that it is possible to grow many cold-tolerant cultivars of Asian greens, spinach, and lettuce in a high tunnel during the winter months in both mild and cold temperate northern climates. High tunnels, also called hoophouses, are used worldwide to provide environmental control for raising horticultural crops (Lamont, 2009; Waterer, 2003; Wells and Loy, 1993). Protected cultivation with high tunnels is not as prevalent in the United States as it is in other parts of the world, but interest is growing rapidly for small-scale producers wanting earlier crop maturity and a longer season for sales at local markets (Carey et al., 2009). High tunnels are used primarily to minimize environmental effects on crop production either by extending the growing season in both spring and fall or providing protection from wind and rain in warmer months or climates (Lamont et al., 2003; Lang, 2009; Panter, 2007; Wein, 2006). High tunnels can modify the climate sufficiently to lengthen the growing season from 1 to 4 weeks in the spring and 2 to 8 weeks in the fall (Wells and Loy, 1993). Unlike traditional greenhouses, high tunnels do not have power for heat, lights, or fans, and crops are planted directly into the soil. Giacomelli (2009) describes thoroughly high tunnel design, construction, and environmental control. Many crops have been successfully cultivated in the United States and throughout the world in high tunnels, including vegetable crops (Carey et al., 2009; Lamont, 2009; Lamont et al., 2003; Waterer, 2003), small fruit (Demchak, 2009; Lamont et al., 2003), cut flowers (Lamont, 2009; Wien, 2009), and small-statured fruit trees (Lang, 2009). Benefits that high tunnels provide to horticultural crops include soil warming, reduced soil compaction, and often reduced diseases and insect pests (Demchak, 2009; Lamont et al., 2003; Lang, 2009). As a result, crop yield and quality can be improved when crops are grown in a high tunnel (Carey et al., 2009; Demchak, 2009; Lang, 2009; Waterer, 2003). Cultivar selection is an important consideration for winter production because crops must have tolerance to cold temperatures and freezing even in protected structures. Maynard and Hochmuth (2006) have classified many leafy green vegetables as cool season-hardy (cabbage, kale, mustard, spinach) or halfhardy (Chinese cabbage, lettuce). Information on optimum growing conditions is not available for all Asian greens (Brassica rapa L.) but Chinese cabbage grows best in moderate to cool temperatures (13 to 24 C; Bennett et al., 2010) and can tolerate frost (Cramer et al., 2006). The optimum temperature range for lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.) is 13 to 16 C but it can tolerate temperatures as low as –2 C without damage (Mansour and Raab, 1996). The optimum temperature is 17 C for spinach (Spinacia oleracea L.), but it can tolerate temperatures as low as –9 C without injury (Koike et al., 2011). Spinach may be grown in the open field where winters are mild by seeding in mid to late September (Mansour and Raab, 1996). The cold hardiness of Asian greens, lettuce, and spinach suggest they may be ideal for winter high tunnel cultivation in Washington State and may expand the market for leafy greens in the region and other areas with similar climatic conditions. The purpose of this study was to assess the yield of leafy green vegetables grown for a salad mix in a high tunnel during the winter in two climatically different locations in Washington and to characterize several environmental factors that may affect their yield. The specific objective was to examine the effects of location, crop type, and time of harvest on yield of cultivars included in this study. This information could provide growers an affordable opportunity to attain year-long local production. Materials and Methods Study locations. This experiment was conducted at two climatically different locations, with similar latitudes, east and west of the Cascade Mountains in Washington State. In 2005–06, the eastern field site was at Moscow, ID [lat. 46.73 N, long. 116.99 W; elevation 792 m (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, 2009)], which was only 13 km away from the 2006–07 field site at Pullman, WA [lat. 46.73 N, long. 117.17 W; elevation 779 m (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, 2009)]. The two field sites have similar winter weather and environmental conditions with an average temperature of –0.3 C, an average maximum temperature of 3.3 C, and an average minimum temperature of –3.8 C (December to February, 1960 to 2006; Office of the Washington State Climatologist, 2009). The soil type at the Moscow site is a Naff Fine-Silty, Mixed, Superactive, Mesic Typic Agrixeroll and at the Pullman site a Palouse Fine-Silty, Mixed, Superactive, Mesic Pachic Ultic Haploxeroll. The western field site was at Vancouver, WA [lat. 45.63 N, long. 122.67 W; elevation 50 m (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Received for publication 30 Aug. 2012.

The average winter temperature was 4.4 C, the average maximum temperature was 8.5 C, and the average minimum temperature was 0.4 C (December to February, 1960 to 2006; Office of the Washington State Climatologist, 2009). The soil type at the Vancouver location is a Hillsboro Fine-Silty, Mixed, Superactive, Mesic Ultic Agrixeroll. High tunnel structure. The high tunnels were 5 m wide and 15 m long (75 m) at Moscow, 6 m wide and 15 m long (90 m) at Pullman, and 5 m wide and 20 m long (100 m) at Vancouver. Each was covered with a single layer of 0.15-mm ultraviolet-treated greenhouse plastic and planting was directly in the soil. The end doors were opened during the daytime to ventilate the high tunnels on warm, sunny days and closed again at night when temperatures became cool. Trial dates and crop cultivars. Both years, all cultivars were started from seed in a greenhouse, and seeding dates were 2 weeks apart each year. Seedlings were transplanted at 6 weeks into the high tunnel (Table 1). In 2005–06, a total of 20 cultivars were seeded: eight Asian greens, 10 lettuce, and two spinach. ‘Mizuna’ was not included in the first planting at either location as a result of late arrival of seed, whereas Tat Soi and ‘Cardinale’ were not included at Vancouver as a result of lack of seed availability. In 2006–07, a subset of 12 cultivars was selected based on plant growth: four Asian greens, six lettuce, and two spinach. Each planting was in a separate bed in a high tunnel with four replicates arranged in a randomized complete block design. Each bed measured 1 m wide and 15 m long (15 m), and beds were spaced 1.5 m apart. In 2005–06, two plants of each cultivar were transplanted into an area of 20 cm 3 25 cm (500 cm) and in 2006–07, four plants of each cultivar were transplanted into an area of 40 cm 3 25 cm (1000 cm). Both years plant density was 40 plants/m. Fertility management. At all locations, compost was added to the beds at 10 kg·m wet weight and incorporated to a depth of 10 cm; incorporation was 3 to 4 weeks before the first planting the first year and 2 weeks before the first planting the second year. At Moscow, compost was 1.2% to 1.4% total nitrogen (N) with 25 carbon (C):1 N on a dry weight basis and at Pullman compost was 1.4% total N with 20 C:1 N. At Vancouver, compost was 0.9% to 1.1% total N with 22 to 30 C:1 N in 2005–06 and was 1.1% total N with a 19 C:1 N in 2006– 07. All compost samples were analyzed for C/N ratios by the University of Idaho Analytical Sciences Laboratory in Moscow, ID. At all locations in 2005–06, BioGro fish-fertilizer (7N–3.1P–1.7K; Bio-gro, Inc., Mabton, WA) was applied at a rate of 118 to 236 mL/plant and Acadian Seaplants seaweed extract (1N–0.44P–16.6K with trace minerals; Acadian Seaplants Limited, Nova Scotia, Canada) was applied at a rate of 12.5 mL/plant at transplanting and every 3 weeks thereafter.

Achievement of this goal may be made more difficult in some settings by climate change through adverse impact on agricultural productivity. However, there is only limited quantitative evidence on the link between household crop harvests and child nutrition. We examined this link in a largely subsistence farming population in rural Burkina Faso.MethodsData on the middle-upper arm circumference (MUAC) of 975 children ≤5 years of age, household crop yields, and other parameters were obtained from the Nouna Health and Demographic Surveillance System. Multilevel modelling was used to assess the relationship between MUAC and the household crop harvest in the year 2009 estimated in terms of kilocalories per adult equivalent per day (kcal/ae/d).ResultsFourteen percent of children had a MUAC <125 mm (a value indicative of acute undernutrition). The relationship between MUAC and annual household food energy production adjusted for age, sex, month of MUAC measurement, household wealth, whether a household member had a non-agricultural occupation, garden produce, village infrastructure and market presence, suggested a decline in MUAC below around 3000 kcal/ae/d. The mean MUAC was 2.49 (95% CI 0.45, 4.52) mm less at 1000 than at 3000 kcal/ae/d.ConclusionsLow per capita household crop production is associated with poorer nutritional status of children in a rural farming population in Burkina Faso. This and similar populations may thus be vulnerable to the adverse effects of weather on agricultural harvest, especially in the context of climate change.",https://ehjournal.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s12940-017-0258-9,

The samples were randomly sampled from five agricultural regions of Romania and analyzed for mycotoxins by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. An SPSS analysis was done to explore correlations between mycotoxins (deoxynivalenol—DON, aflatoxins—AF, ochratoxin A—OTA, zearalenone—ZEA), product types (raw cereal, processed cereal, cereal-based food), geographic coordinates (latitude, longitude, agricultural region), and agroclimatic factors (air temperature, precipitation, soil moisture reserve, aridity index, soil type). In the southeast part of the Southern Plain and Dobrogea (Baragan Plain, located at 44–45° N, 26–27° E), contamination with AF and OTA was higher in raw and processed cereals (maize in silo, silo corn germs) in the dry years (2012 and 2013), and contamination with DON was high in processed cereals (wheat flour type 450) in the rainy year (2014). DON and OTA contamination were significantly correlated with cumulative precipitation in all years, while AF and ZEA contamination were non-significantly correlated with climatic factors and aridity indices. The distribution of mycotoxins by product type and the non-robust correlations between post-harvest mycotoxins and agrometeorological factors could be explained by the use of quality management systems that control cereal at warehouse receptions, performant processing technologies, and the quality of storage spaces of agri-food companies. The Baragan Plain is Romania’s most sensitive area to the predicted climate change in southeast Europe, which may be associated with its increased cereal contamination with AF and OTA.",https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6651/10/12/533/pdf?version=1544682316,

Th e top producing states based on hectares harvested in 2013 were: North Dakota (33%), Michigan (13%), and Idaho (9%) (USDA-NASS, 2014a). Michigan is the second largest producer of navy bean and the largest producer of black bean in the United States (USDA-NASS, 2014b). Under conventional dry bean production, producers typically treat seeds with insecticides and/ or fungicides and both preand post-emergence herbicides are used to control weeds. Furthermore, though dry bean is a legume, 45 kg N ha–1 or more is applied at planting in conventional systems as N fi xation is not as effi cient in dry bean as in other legumes, such as soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] (George and Singleton, 1992). Demand for organically produced dry bean has been on the rise in recent years both within the United States and abroad. Michigan was the top organic dry bean producing state in 2011, with 33% of the total organic area harvested (USDAERS, 2013). Producing a quality dry bean crop without the use of synthetic amendments and pesticides presents unique challenges for organic growers, especially when it comes to soil fertility, pest management (i.e., insects, diseases, and weeds) and bean cultivar selection. Cover crops are one possible solution to address soil fertility and some pest management issues in the production of organic dry bean. Cover crops can impact soil fertility, specifi cally N availability, through nutrient scavenging (Sainju et al., 1998; O’Reilly et al., 2012) and N fi xation by leguminous cover crops (Stivers and Shennan, 1991; Sainju and Singh, 2001). Th e magnitude and timeframe over which cover crops alter soil inorganic N is dependent on many factors, including environment and climate, soil characteristics (soil composition), cover crop characteristics (composition and growth stage) and management practices (crop rotation, tillage, etc.) (Wagger et al., 1998; Dabney et al., 2010). Two commonly grown cover crops in the Midwest are medium red clover and cereal rye because the seed is readily available and relatively inexpensive. Medium red clover is typically interseeded into, or planted following, a small-grain the year before corn (Zea mays L.) is planted, whereas cereal rye is most oft en planted between corn and soybean or dry bean.

This is good news, especially since groundwater has been widely ignored, misunderstood or abused, as a fundamental global resource. This important paper goes a long way to raising the profile of groundwater in Africa by providing first-order estimates of the available storage (taking account of saturated aquifer thickness and porosity) as well as mapping expected water yields (aquifer productivity) in that continent. Reliable estimates of groundwater resources can now be set against the far more widely reported surface water availability. The constraints of the methodology used to compile these maps are duly acknowledged, and are well within the hydrogeological state-of-the-art. The paper is backed by carefully reviewed sources of data and a considerable effort has been made to incorporate the extensive grey literature. It is important that this benchmark study is received with the acclaim it deserves. However, the headline—that groundwater storage is some 100 times the annual renewable surface waters—could be misconstrued as implying that groundwater is an abundant new resource, which it is not. Whilst groundwater is key to sustainable development, renewability and accessibility issues need to be addressed. The paper may therefore be seized upon to justify unsustainable groundwater exploitation, or to provide an argument against funding to NGOs and others, for water provision for needy communities. Some constraints that must be taken into account are elaborated here. The conclusions of the paper (MacDonald et al 2012) demonstrate that modest yields of groundwater are quite widely available at accessible depths and sufficient to sustain small communities and their development, but larger yields (>5 l s−1) suitable for urban development or major agricultural schemes are unlikely outside of the sedimentary terrain. The availability and accessibility of groundwater over much of Africa, therefore, is favourable to rural rather than urban development. One of the real opportunities presented in the paper is that groundwater should be more widely used for a revolution in rural development. To this end, the use of managed aquifer recharge (MAR), coupled with other forms of rainwater harvesting, can also locally conserve and augment groundwater resources and offer obvious advantages over building surface water storage. The large sedimentary aquifers of Africa contain some 0.66 million km3 in storage (MacDonald et al 2012); but most of this water (0.44 M km3) is contained beneath eight Saharan countries (see table 1, MacDonald et al 2012). This includes the Nubian Sandstone aquifer system, underlying Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad. In Libya this immense high yielding aquifer may be over 2.5 km thick (Pallas 1980) but considerable depths to the water table make for costly development. Water in Libya is currently being extracted (mined) from remote inland areas for transmission to the coast, from wells typically 300–500 m deep with estimated well-field lifetimes unlikely to exceed 50 years (Pallas and Salem 2001). This and the other Saharan aquifers are accessible only to a very small fraction of the African population. Groundwater extraction and transmission is possible only with the energy provided from the proximity of fossil fuels; large water transfer schemes are energy intensive and for most areas of Africa not an economic option, having also social and ecological consequences (Matete and Hassan 2005). Moreover a steady decline in water tables (typically from 0.5 to 2 m yr) has been taking place widely in semi-arid areas globally, mostly due to abstraction exceeding recharge, with consequences for both human requirements and ecosystems. Thus a major limiting factor is the need to identify whether the stored groundwater is a renewable or a non-renewable resource. In the case of deep basins such as the Saharan aquifers this water can be shown, from numerous studies, to be almost entirely non-renewable, ‘fossil’ water, recharged under wetter early Holocene or late Pleistocene climates, prior to onset of a more arid climate around 4500 years BP (Edmunds et al 2004). Small amounts of modern recharge (for example in the Atlas Mountains or Tibesti) are insufficient to have an impact on the drawdown of distant well fields. It is critical, therefore, to base resource estimates for any development on knowledge of the locally renewable amounts from rainfall and to consider mining palaeo-reserves only as a last resort. Hydrogeological techniques are available to quantify modern recharge (Scanlon and Cook 2002, Scanlon et al 2006) and rates can vary widely according to rock type and landscape; reliance on modelled estimates alone could be misleading. Water quality is also a limiting factor in quantifying usable fresh groundwater storage. In addition to the regional or local problems caused by fluoride, in areas of East and West Africa (MacDonald et al 2012), salinity, above all, will restrict the total usable storage for domestic use and food production, most notably in semi-arid or arid areas. Groundwater salinity arises from various sources, including lithologies containing evaporite minerals, residual sea water (especially in continental coastal margins) and evapotranspiration. As a general rule, salinity increases with depth (older waters tend to more saline), but an additional problem arises where salinity has built up due to aridification over several millennia. Playas and sebkhats are surface expressions of this salinity accumulation from surface water or groundwater discharge, but clearance of native vegetation also increases recharge and leads to salinity increase (George et al 1997). Near-surface salt accumulation may be drawn down into cones of depression in areas of development. One of the largest artesian aquifers, the Continental Intercalaire of Algeria and Tunisia, has groundwater discharge with a salinity of 1–3 g l−1, locally as high as 7 g l−1 in the Tunisian Chotts (Edmunds et al 2003, Zammouri et al 2007), limiting water for irrigated agriculture. The volumes of non-saline and groundwater in the total storage therefore need to be considered as part of the storage.

Grape rootstock breeding for increased drought tolerance could contribute to continued sustainable yields as fresh water supplies decline. Rhizotron containers were used in a greenhouse to investigate the predictive measures of drought tolerance in young grapevine rootstocks. Deeper rooting distributions were found for the drought-tolerant rootstocks ‘110R’ (Vitis berlandieri · Vitis rupestris) and ‘Ramsey’ (Vitis champinii, a natural hybrid of Vitis candicans · V. rupestris) as opposed to shallower distributions observed in the more drought-sensitive rootstocks ‘101-14Mgt’ (Vitis riparia · V. rupestris) and ‘RipariaGloire’ (V. riparia). Production of new roots during a 6-day nonirrigated period declined 45% to 53% for ‘Riparia Gloire’ and ‘101-14Mgt’, respectively, but showed no change in ‘110R’ and ‘Ramsey’. Slow growth, a hallmark of abiotic stress tolerance, was evident in the drought-tolerant rootstocks in their relatively slow shoot growth before drought stress and their relatively slow new root growth during recovery, especially for ‘Ramsey’. High stomatal conductance (gS) corresponded with drought tolerance and distinguished rootstocks best during the first 3 days of recovery, with a mean value for ‘Ramsey’ 2.7 times higher than ‘101-14Mgt’. Stomatal conductance during recovery may serve as the most efficient means of predicting drought tolerance capacity in a breeding program. The use of rootstocks in viticulture was initiated in response to the widespread destruction of European vineyards after the inadvertent introduction of the grape phylloxera (Daktulosphaira vitifoliae) during the mid-19th century (Ordish, 1972). Rootstocks have since been developed for other traits that include nematode resistance, lime tolerance, salt tolerance, tolerance of saturated soil, and influence on scion vigor and fruit maturity (Galet, 1998; Pongr acz, 1983). Drought tolerance can also be included on this list, and the need for further improvement in rootstock-mediated drought tolerance is underscored by recent droughts in major grape-growing regions of Australia (National Climate Centre, 2010) and California (Di Liberto, 2015) and concomitant increasing urban demands on a limited freshwater supply (Fishman, 2012). Variability in rootstock-mediated drought tolerance occurring among commercially available rootstocks has been documented. On the tolerant end of this spectrum are rootstocks derived from V. champinii. Such tolerance may be a characteristic of the species: for example, an accession of V. champinii was shown to have the strongest drought tolerance of 17 Vitis species compared simultaneously (Padgett-Johnson et al., 2003). An example of aV. champinii rootstock that is generally regarded as drought tolerant is ‘Ramsey’, which is widely used in Australia (Walker and Clingeleffer, 2009). In multiple field trials, yield and pruning weight were highest when Vitis vinifera was grafted onto ‘Ramsey’ (Cirami and McCarthy, 1988; McCarthy et al., 1997; Stevens et al., 2008). In the McCarthy et al. (1997) study, ‘Ramsey’ had the highest yield in both a dry-farmed treatment and an irrigated control, and similar results were reported in Stevens et al. (2008). These results imply that the rank order of performance under unstressed conditions could be predictive for drought tolerance capacity, a principle supported by the correlation of pruningweight rank order (and to a lesser degree, yield) of five grape rootstocks over a wide range of midday leaf water potentials, induced using increasingly restrictive irrigation regimes (Williams, 2010). This principle was also true for the rootstock ‘Richter 110’ (hereafter ‘110R’), whichwas included in the abovementioned studies and is also considered to be drought tolerant (Keller, 2015). In these studies, ‘110R’ produced lower yields and pruningweight relative to ‘Ramsey’ under both control and water-stressed conditions (McCarthy et al., 1997; Stevens et al., 2008), and also in field trials not specifically targeting performance under drought (Cirami and McCarthy, 1988). On the drought-sensitive end of the spectrum are rootstocks derived fromV. riparia, and two examples areV. riparia ‘Riparia Gloire de Montpellier’ (hereafter ‘Riparia’) and a rootstock Received for publication 7 Sept. 2016.

Dry and Coombe (2005) note that V. riparia-based rootstocks are in general regarded as drought sensitive, and that both ‘Riparia’ and ‘101-14Mgt’ were recommended against in a drought-prone region as early as 1935 (de Castella). Pouget andDelas (1989) rank ‘Riparia’ and ‘101-14Mgt’ as low in drought resistance and ‘110R’ as high, and a literature review of rootstock surveys by Ollat et al. (2015) ranked ‘Riparia’ as low, ‘101-14Mgt’ as very low tomedium, ‘110R’ as high to very high, and ‘Ramsey’ as medium to very high in water stress adaptation. Despite these cited studies, the ranking of multiple rootstocks for yield and pruning weight using common garden style field trials produces notoriously inconsistent results. Two of many examples include Lambert et al. (2008) who observed an expected ‘Ramsey’ > ‘110R’ > ‘101-14Mgt’ rank ordering of pruning weight and yield in some sites, but not others, and an instance where the expected ‘Ramsey’ > ‘101-14Mgt’ rank order for pruning weight was inverted (Southey, 1992). The environmental influences that likely underlie the sometimes-observed confounding of yield and biomass as measures of drought tolerance might be averted in part if surveys were to be performed in the greater environmental uniformity of a greenhouse with a pestand diseasefree and even-textured soil media, as were performed by Carbonneau (1985) and Natali et al. (1985). In the present study, a rhizotron container system was used with the abovementioned rootstocks ‘Ramsey’, ‘110R’, ‘Riparia’, and ‘101-14Mgt’, and sought to expand on these earlier greenhouse-based assays. Questions in this study specifically addressed 1) the degree to which strictly anatomical characterizations of root architecture and shoot biomass in unstressed young vines could predict drought-tolerance capacity, 2) the degree to which root and shoot growth responses of young vines to a single cycle of drought stress and recovery could predict drought-tolerance capacity, 3) the degree to which and in what time period (i.e., stress vs. recovery) gS of young vines could predict drought-tolerance capacity, and 4) the degree to which measures of young vines at harvest (following drought stress and recovery) could predict drought-tolerance capacity. Elucidation of these questions could provide insights into the genetically based variability of whole plant level responses to drought stress and recovery, and optimize the breeding of Vitis rootstocks for improved drought tolerance. Materials and Methods RHIZOTRON CONSTRUCTION, PLANT MATERIALS, AND PROPAGATION. Rhizotrons were constructed according to James et al. (1985) and consisted of a 61.0 · 30.5-cm acrylic glass face with a plywood backing of equal dimensions (Fig. 1). The plywood backing and acrylic glass face were aligned and separated by vinyl tubing of 19-mm o.d., creating a soil media depth of 51 cm and average width of 21 cm. Acrylic glass and plywood were fastened with bolts along the rhizotron perimeter. A hole was drilled through the bottom of the vinyl tubing to allow for water drainage. Rhizotrons were filled with a soil media composed of 40% (v/v) washed sand, 20% (v/v) sphagnum peatmoss, 20% (v/v) redwood compost, and 20% (v/v) pumice rock with the following amendments: 148 g m potassium nitrate, 148 g m potassium sulfate, 1.48 kg m single superphosphate, 4.45 kg m dolomite lime, and 1.48 kg m calcium carbonate lime. Dormant cuttings of ‘Ramsey’, ‘110R’, ‘Riparia’, and ‘10114Mgt’ were collected on 28 Feb. 2013 from vines maintained at the University of California, Davis, and stored at 2.2 C. Noting that different wine grape cultivars are known to exhibit differential vigor (Kerridge and Antcliff, 1999) and might therefore variably affect rootstock traits, this study focused on traits measured while using the single scion cultivar V. vinifera Merlot and is not intended to compare scion–rootstock interactions. Scion wood of ‘Merlot’ was grafted onto the four rootstocks on 27 Mar. 2013, callused at 27 C in moistened 50:50 perlite/vermiculite, and planted in equal parts perlite/ vermiculite/peat with 27 C bottom heat on 4 Apr. 2013. Eight vines of each rootstock type were selected for uniformity and planted individually into eight separate rhizotrons on 1 May 2013; given four rootstock types, 32 total rhizotrons were used in this experiment. Measurements of roots, described below, commenced 1 week later and therefore 8 May 2013 was designated week 1, day 1. At the time of planting, weight of the rhizotron, dry soil media, and plant weight was recorded using an electronic scale with 60-kg capacity and 5-g resolution (HW-60KGL; A&D Co., Elk Grove, IL). Rhizotrons were watered to saturation a second time following sunset on the day of planting and the total weight was recor",https://journals.ashs.org/downloadpdf/journals/jashs/142/1/article-p36.pdf,

Intercropping with legumes is an important component of climate-smart agriculture (CSA) in sub-Saharan Africa, but little is known about its effect on soil greenhouse gas (GHG) exchange. A field experiment was established at Hawassa in the Ethiopian rift valley, comparing nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4) fluxes in minerally fertilized maize (64 kg N ha−1) with and without Crotalaria (C. juncea) or lablab (L. purpureus) as intercrops over two growing seasons. To study the effect of intercropping time, intercrops were sown either 3 or 6 weeks after maize. The legumes were harvested at flowering, and half of the aboveground biomass was mulched. In the first season, cumulative N2O emissions were largest in 3-week lablab, with all other treatments being equal to or lower than the fertilized maize mono-crop. After reducing mineral N input to intercropped systems by 50 % in the second season, N2O emissions were comparable with the fully fertilized control. Maize-yield-scaled N2O emissions in the first season increased linearly with aboveground legume N yield (p=0.01), but not in the second season when early rains resulted in less legume biomass because of shading by maize. Growing-season N2O-N emission factors varied from 0.02 % to 0.25 % in 2015 and 0.11 % to 0.20 % in 2016 of the estimated total N input. Growing-season CH4 uptake ranged from 1.0 to 1.5 kg CH4-C ha−1, with no significant differences between treatments or years but setting off the N2O-associated emissions by up to 69 %. Our results suggest that leguminous intercrops may increase N2O emissions when developing large biomass in dry years but, when mulched, can replace part of the fertilizer N in normal years, thus supporting CSA goals while intensifying crop production in the region.",https://bg.copernicus.org/articles/17/345/2020/bg-17-345-2020.pdf,

Results reveal that more research efforts need to be exerted towards the very vulnerable Southern Africa. The adoption of innovative agricultural practices should focus on rainwater harvesting and mulching while other CSA practices such as crop diversification and crop rotation show a high number of practices. However, major challenges facing smallholder farmers are financial availability, access to information and farm size. These hinder stallholder farmers’ ability to contribute to food security.

The spatial distribution of the onset time of rains, the length of the Yala and the Maha seasons and the number of dry weeks within seasons were determined using weekly rainfall data from 36 rainfall stations in the Dry and Intermediate Zones. Based on the seasonal rainfall characteristics, the cropping calendars for rice crops for each agro-ecological region (AER) were prepared. This study discloses a high spatial variability of the onset time of both the Yala and Maha seasons. Many AERs in the Dry Zone and some AERs in the Intermediate Zone do not have a distinct Yala season. The Yala rains in the Dry Zone are highly variable and the most probable length of the season may not exceed four weeks from the onset time. During the Maha season, there is enough rain water for paddy cultivation. The proposed cropping calendars can be used as a tool in farming activities from the land preparation to harvesting. Such information could assist to reduce the amount of irrigation water required and the frequency of water issued from the tanks in the respective regions without a wide margin of errors. It can also be used as a decision support tool in planning rainfed upland agricultural systems as well. The identification of dry periods within a season is necessary for the farmers to be aware and adapt to recent advanced technologies to reduce the water use for rice cultivation. Periodical checking and revision of the cropping calendars with future climate predictions are recommended.

We review here recent developments in the biology and management of rodent pests in cereal cropping systems in Asia. The past decade has seen a strong focus on ecologically-based rodent management (EBRM), its adoption in field studies significantly increased rice yields (6-15%) and income (>15%) in seven Asian countries. EBRM principles also have been successfully applied to maize in China. We provide case studies on EBRM in Cambodia, on interactions between rodent pests and weeds, and on the importance of modified wetlands for biodiversity and rodent pest management. Knowledge on post-harvest impacts of rodents is increasing. One research gap is the assessment of human health impacts from a reduction of rodent densities in and around houses. We identify ten challenges for the next decade. For example, the need for population modelling, a valuable tool missing from our toolbox to manage rodent pests in cereal systems. We also need to understand better the interactive effects of cropping intensification, conservation agriculture and climate change.

The climate services have the potential to help identifying and adequately addressing the expected changes in climate and their impacts on agricultural production systems. However, the development of effective climate services is conditioned by the need to clearly understand the critical decisions that underpin end-users' activities and how climate information can support those decision-making processes. This paper reviews and identifies the main decisions linked to key climate change impacts on the cropping systems of interest—olive, grape and durum wheat—in order to inform the development of climate services for these crops in the future. Our review results indicate two types of key findings: (i) the most common types of decisions across the three cropping systems address the increase in temperature, variability, and uneven distribution of rainfall, occurrence of extreme events, and increased solar radiation; (ii) the most common decisions are likely to be affected by an increase in temperature above the maximum supported by the three crops, or in combination with other impacting climate changes. These decisions mainly relate to irrigation and other water stress reducing measures (olive, durum wheat), choice of varieties (grape, durum wheat), clones and rootstocks (grape), training system and vine load (olive, grape), canopy management (olive, grape), change in planting/sowing and harvest date (olive, durum wheat), pest and disease management (grape), allocation/choice of cultivation area (grape, durum wheat), use of decision support tools (grape), and crop insurance (durum wheat). In these decision-making contexts, the timely availability of climate information on temperature increase and rainfall variability can be used for developing climate services to effectively support the affected decisions. Although this paper does not provide an exhaustive analysis, the entry points identified can be considered as starting points for informing the development of climate services to further support the adjustment of decision making for the identified olive, grape, and durum wheat cropping systems, as well as similar decision-making contexts beyond those identified here.",https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fsufs.2020.00064/pdf,

Long‐term fertilization and tilling permanently alter soil bacterial and fungal communities, requiring microbe‐targeted restoration methods to improve belowground ecosystem services and carbon storage in newly restored prairies. These techniques are particularly important when restoring for climate‐ready ecosystems, adapted to altered temperature regimes. To approach these issues, we conducted a multi‐factorial greenhouse experiment to test the effects of plant species richness, soil amendment and elevated temperature on soil microbial diversity, growth, and function. Treatments consisted of three seedlings of one plant species (Andropogon gerardii) or one seedling each of three plant species (A. gerardii, Echinacea pallida, Coreopsis lanceolata). Soil amendments included cellulose addition, inoculation with a microbial community collected from an undisturbed remnant prairie, and a control. We assessed microbial communities using extracellular enzyme assays, Illumina sequencing of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene, predicted bacterial metabolic pathways from sequence data and phospholipid fatty acid analysis (PLFA), which includes both bacterial and fungal lipid abundances. Our results indicate that addition of cellulose selects for slow‐growing bacterial taxa (Verrucomicrobia) and fungi at ambient temperature. However, at elevated temperature, selection for slow‐growing bacterial taxa is enhanced, while selection for fungi is lost, indicating temperature sensitivity among fungi. Cellulose addition was a more effective means of altering soil community composition than addition of microbial communities harvested from a remnant prairie. Soil water content was typically higher in the A. gerardii treatment alone, regardless of temperature, but at ambient temperature only, predicted metagenomics pathways for bacterial carbon metabolism were more abundant with A. gerardii. In summary, these results from a mesocosm test case indicate that adding cellulose to newly restored soil and increasing the abundance of C4 grasses, such as A. gerardii, can select for microbial communities adapted for slow growth and carbon storage. Further testing is required to determine if these approaches yield the same results in a field‐level experiment.",https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1002/eap.1858,

Understanding these processes comprehensively is essential for obtaining desired natural fibers/fillers from agricultural waste for creating effective bio composites to meet specific application demands. This study aims to provide a comprehensive assessment of the various extraction and modification techniques employed for natural fibers. It offers an in-depth review of diverse extraction processes, ranging from the initial harvesting to the decortication stage. It has been revealed that the choice of extraction methodologies depends on climate, water resources, local traditions, and the desired fiber quality. Additionally, the paper explores chemical and physical treatments, highlighting how each method influences the structure and properties of natural fibers.

A large share of peatlands in northwestern Germany is drained for agricultural purposes, thereby emitting high amounts of greenhouse gases (GHGs). In order to quantify the climatic impact of fen soils in dairy farming systems of northern Germany, GHG exchange and forage yield were determined on four experimental sites which differed in terms of management and drainage intensity: (a) rewetted and unutilized grassland (UG), (b) intensive and wet grassland (GW), (c) intensive and moist grassland (GM) and (d) arable forage cropping (AR). Net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of CO2 and fluxes of CH4 and N2O were measured using closed manual chambers. CH4 fluxes were significantly affected by groundwater level (GWL) and soil temperature, whereas N2O fluxes showed a significant relation to the amount of nitrate in top soil. Annual balances of all three gases, as well as the global warming potential (GWP), were significantly correlated to mean annual GWL. A 2-year mean GWP, combined from CO2–C eq. of NEE, CH4 and N2O emissions, as well as C input (slurry) and C output (harvest), was 3.8, 11.7, 17.7 and 17.3 Mg CO2–C eq. ha−1 a−1 for sites UG, GW, GM and AR, respectively (standard error (SE) 2.8, 1.2, 1.8, 2.6). Yield-related emissions for the three agricultural sites were 201, 248 and 269 kg CO2–C eq. (GJ net energy lactation; NEL)−1 for sites GW, GM and AR, respectively (SE 17, 9, 19). The carbon footprint of agricultural commodities grown on fen soils depended on long-term drainage intensity rather than type of management, but management and climate strongly influenced interannual on-site variability. However, arable forage production revealed a high uncertainty of yield and therefore was an unsuitable land use option. Lowest yield-related GHG emissions were achieved by a three-cut system of productive grassland swards in combination with a high GWL (long-term mean  ≤  20 cm below the surface).",https://www.biogeosciences.net/13/5221/2016/bg-13-5221-2016.pdf,

For this purpose, five irrigation management strategies, ranging from no irrigation (NI) to controlled deficit irrigation (CDI) and full irrigation (FI), were evaluated concerning their impact on the inter-seasonal variability of the expected yields and improvements of the yield potential. The study was conducted on a maize crop (Zea mays L.) at a representative site in northern Togo with a hot semi-arid climate and pronounced dry and wet rainfall seasons. The OCCASION (Optimal Climate Change Adaption Strategies in Irrigation) framework was adapted and applied. It consists of: (i) a weather generator for simulating long climate time series; (ii) the AquaCrop model, which was used to simulate the irrigation system during the growing season and the yield response of maize to the considered irrigation management strategies; and (iii) a problem-specific algorithm for optimal irrigation scheduling with limited water supply. We found high variability in rainfall during the wet season which leads to considerable variability in the expected yield for rainfed conditions (NI). This variability was significantly reduced when supplemental irrigation management strategies (CDI or FI) requiring a reasonably low water demand of about 150 mm were introduced. For the dry season, it was shown that both irrigation management strategies (CDI and FI) would increase yield potential for the local variety TZEE-W up to 4.84 Mg/ha and decrease the variability of the expected yield at the same time. However, even with CDI management, more than 400 mm of water is required if irrigation would be introduced during the dry season in northern Togo.

Exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity of agricultural livelihoods to climate variability and change differ across agro-ecologies and these pose a challenge to climate resilient development strategy. This study assesses agro-ecology specific vulnerability of smallholder farmers to climate change and variability in the Dabus Watershed (North-west Ethiopia), based on a survey of 734 farm households complemented with focus group discussion and key informant interviews. Recognizing the physiographic and climatic diversity that exists across agro-ecologies in the study area, Livelihood Vulnerability Index (LVI) framed within the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) vulnerability framework (LVI-IPCC) is adapted to assess agro-ecology specific vulnerability in two local agro-ecologies, namely wet lowland and dry lowland. For each agro-ecology, exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity indices as well as LVI-IPCC vulnerability score was calculated. The result shows that the dry lowland agro-ecology has a relatively higher exposure and sensitivity to climate stresses with a comparatively limited adaptive capability. On the other hand, the wet lowland agro-ecology exhibits intermediate vulnerability with a relatively lower perceived exposure and higher adaptive capacity. Higher exposure relative to adaptive capacity resulted in a positive LVI-IPCC score in the dry lowland agro-ecology and positioned it in more vulnerable level than the wet lowland. A higher adaptive capacity relative to exposure unveils a negative LVI-IPCC score for the wet lowland agro-ecology and positioned it in a moderate vulnerability category. In line with the findings, there is a need to set agro-ecology specific priorities for intervention that is most needed to cop up with the effects of climate variability and change in each agro-ecology. Climate risk exposure levels can be reduced through timely provision of climate specific information and early warning systems aimed at enhancing preparedness of farm households to extreme events. It is also crucial to expand availability of infrastructural facilities such as market, health services, and veterinary services so as to enhance adaptive capacity.

Spinach, chard, and kale maximum Pn were 23.8, 20.3, and 18.2mmol CO2·m ·s fixed, respectively, across varieties (400 ppmCO2). Spinach and kale had the highest and lowest light compensation points [LCPs (73 and 13 mmol·m·s, respectively)] across varieties. The light saturation points (LSPs) for chard and kale were similar at 884–978 mmol·m·s, but for spinach, the LSP was higher at 1238 mmol·m·s. Dark respiration was lowest on kale and highest on spinach (L0.83 andL5.00 mmol CO2·m ·s, respectively). The spinach CO2 compensation point (CCP) was lower (56 ppm) than the chard or kale CCP (64–65 ppm). Among varieties, ‘Red Russian’ kale Pn saturated at the lowest CO2 concentration (858 ppm), and ‘Bright Lights’ chard saturated at the highest (1266 ppm; 300 mmol·m·s). Spinach Pn was more responsive to increasing irradiance than to CO2. Kale Pn was more responsive to increasing CO2 than to irradiance, and chard Pn was equally responsive to increasing CO2 or irradiance. Implications and limitations of this work when ‘‘upscaling’’ to whole-plant responses are discussed. Leafy green vegetable options are increasing as communities become more ethnically or racially diverse or both, as the health and nutritional benefits of greens consumption are reported (Bertoia et al., 2015; Hu and Rimm, 2015), and as interest in year-round locally produced foods increases (Feldmann and Hamm, 2015). Three increasingly popular leafy vegetables are kale (Brassica oleracea and B. napus pabularia), spinach (Spinacea oleracea), and Swiss chard (chard, Beta vulgaris). Kale, spinach, and chard leaves are harvested and sold on a fresh-weight basis. The ability of plants to increase fresh weight, or mass, is associated with photosynthesis where plant mass generally increases as photosynthesis increases (Bj€orkman, 1981; Chagvardieff et al., 1994; Dorais, 2003). The primary inputs into the photosynthetic process are light (irradiance), CO2, and water (Bj€orkman, 1981). Therefore, maximizing photosynthesis in leafy greens to maximize yield would require that irradiance, CO2, or water not be limited (Fu et al., 2017; Gaudreau et al., 1994; Gent, 2016). In northern climates, year-round leafy green production requires protected cultivation during the late fall, winter, and early spring when temperatures drop below freezing. Irradiance and CO2 in protected cultivation often vary, intentionally and unintentionally, depending on covering type, plant spacing, degree of ventilation, whether air is circulated, and whether supplemental lighting or CO2 are supplied (Kretchen and Howlett, 1970). Little work has been conducted on the effects of irradiance and CO2 on the Pn of leafy greens other than lettuce (Lactuca sativa; Dorais, 2003; Fu et al., 2017; Gaudreau et al., 1994) and recent work by Gent (2016) on spinach. An understanding of how irradiance and CO2 impact the Pn of such greens would facilitate maximizing the Pn to maximize yield in protected cultivation. The objective of the research presented here was to determine the Pn responses of spinach, kale, and chard to irradiance and CO2 and to inform producers of the advantages or disadvantages of reduced or increased irradiance or CO2 on yield. We also desired to determine whether leafy green varieties differed in the Pn responses to irradiance and CO2 and whether some varieties were more suited to supplemental, or reduced, irradiance and CO2 levels. We acknowledge that translating instantaneous Pn measurements on a per-unit-area basis to whole-plant photosynthesis has limitations (see Discussion). Yet, an initial comparative study exploring the variation in the instantaneous Pn on a per-unit-area basis is valuable in that it provides some insight into the degree of variation among species and varieties. These data also provide some guidance on irradiance and CO2 levels that maximize the Pn on the uppermost leaves, especiallywhen plants are young and interior leaf shading is limited. Materials and Methods Chard, [‘Rhubarb’, ‘Fordhook Giant’, ‘Bright Yellow’, and ‘Bright Lights’ (red)], kale [‘Toscano’, ‘Winterbor’, and ‘Red Russian’ (B. napus pabularia)], and spinach (‘Melody’, ‘Harmony’, and ‘Bloomsdale LS’) seeds were sown in 10.5-cm-diameter plastic pots (5 seeds/pot) in premoistened LC-8 soilless growing media (Sun Gro Horticulture, Bellevue, WA) and placed in a greenhouse (24 ± 2 C day and 16 ± 2 C night temperatures; St. Paul, MN). Kale and chard seeds were obtained from Johnny’s Selected Seeds (Winslow, ME), and spinach seeds were obtained from W. Atlee Burpee & Co. (Warminster, PA). Seeds germinated in 4–7 d. Greenhouse daylight (0800–1400 HR) was supplemented with 75 mmol·m·s highpressure sodium lighting when daylight (at plant level) was below 200 mmol·m·s. After 7 d, the three most uniform (similar size) seedlings were left to grow, whereas the others were removed. As kale and chard flower after they unfold a specific leaf number, after a cool temperature exposure, or both, daylength was extended with 75 mmol·m·s from 1600–2200 HR as flowering was not a concern [16 h photoperiod; mean daily light integral (DLI) = 12.4 mol·m·d] to simulate a typical production environment to maximize yield (J. Erwin, personal observation). In contrast, as long days can promote flowering on spinach early in development, spinach seedlings were grown under short days (8 h photoperiod; opaque cloth pulled over plants from 1400– 0800 HR daily; mean DLI = 10.7 mol·m·d) to inhibit flowering. After 30 d, plants were transplanted into 7.6-l plastic pots. Throughout, plants were watered as needed with irrigation water containing 250 ppm N from 15N–0P–15K fertilizer (Peter’s Dark Weather Feed; The Scotts Co., Marysville, OH).

The Pn was measured using a LI-COR LI6400XT portable photosynthesis meter (LI-COR, Inc., Lincoln, NE) using a cuvette (6 cm) with a built-in variable LED light source. The Pn at 0, 100, 200, 400, 600, 800, 1000, and 1200 mmol·m·s irradiance was determined. The Pn at 50, 200, 400, 600, 800, 1000, and 1200 ppm CO2 was also determined. The Pn was recorded 5 min after a change in irradiance or CO2 after the Pn had stabilized. Throughout, cuvette temperature was maintained at 24 C, and the atmospheric flow rate was 400 mL·min. Cuvette CO2 was 400 ppm (outdoor ambient) when determining the Pn responses to irradiance, and irradiance was 300 mmol·m·s (typical irradiance in a northern U.S. greenhouse during the winter; personal observation) when measuring the Pn responses to CO2. Photosynthetic parameter determination. The Pn data from each leaf of each species and variety at varying irradiance or CO2 were fit to the nonlinear Mitscherlich and the nonrectangular hyperbola functions as both are widely used to estimate the Pn responses to irradiance and CO2 (Aleric and Kirkman, 2005; Goudrian, 1979; Johnson et al., 2010; Laitat and Boussard, 1995; Marino et al., 2010; Peek et al., 2002; Potvin et al., 1990). The Mitscherlich equations (Eqs. [1] and [2]) fit data best here and provided realistic nonlinear parameter values (Table 1; personal observation). More complex biochemical models estimating the leaf Pn [such as used by Farquhar et al. (1980)] were not used, as we quantified the Pn responses to CO2 at irradiance levels typical in northern greenhouses here and not saturating levels typically used with biochemical models.

While historically not prominent, mangrove loss in Madagascar’s Mahajamba Bay is increasing. Here, we focus on Mahajamba Bay, presenting long-term dynamics calculated using United States Geological Survey (USGS) national-level mangrove maps contextualized with socio-economic research and ground observations, and the results of contemporary (circa 2011) mapping of dominant mangrove types. The analysis of the USGS data indicated 1050 hectares (3.8%) lost from 2000 to 2010, which socio-economic research suggests is increasingly driven by commercial timber extraction. Contemporary mapping results permitted stratified sampling based on spectrally distinct and ecologically meaningful mangrove types, allowing for the first-ever vegetation carbon stock estimates for Mahajamba Bay. The overall mean carbon stock across all mangrove classes was estimated to be 100.97 ± 10.49 Mg C ha−1. High stature closed-canopy mangroves had the highest average carbon stock estimate (i.e., 166.82 ± 15.28 Mg C ha−1).

Nepal is at the center of the Himalayan arc and is the focus of this monograph, which presents a definitive account of the country. It is a companion volume to the Flora of Nepal, which is available as an online resource (www.floraofnepal.org). The Himalayas are also the scene for one of the most contested debates in recent decades in relation to environment and development. The ‘‘theory of environmental degradation’’ prevailing in the 1970s and 1980s asserted that environmental collapse in the Himalayas was imminent, because of pressures on natural resources from a rapidly growing and increasingly poor population that were leading to forest degradation, massive erosion, and consequent flooding in the Ganges and Brahmaputra lowlands. Subsequent research has led to a more balanced appraisal of the linkages between human activity and the dynamics of change, but a lack of understanding of complex mountainous dynamics influenced the development policy agenda for many years and highlighted the need for real scientific understanding of these fragile environments for sustainable development. The editors of this tome, with 45 other authors, have drawn on over 40 years of direct experience to bring together the best available information on geology, geomorphology, hydrology, climate, soils, evolutionary biology, ecology, palynology, ethnobotany, anthropology, and conservation. Georg Miehe is professor of biogeography and mountain ecology at Philipps-Universit€at Marburg and has made annual field visits to the Himalayas since 1976, covering terrain from the north of Pakistan to Nepal, Bhutan, northwest Myanmar, Yunnan, and the Tibetan Plateau, studying plant distributions, vegetation communities, and ecology. Colin Pendry of the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh has worked as a taxonomist for the last 20 years, specializing in the flora of Nepal since 2004. Ram Chaudhary is professor of botany at Tribhuvan University, Nepal, and has studied the Himalayas since 1978, covering diverse subjects from floristics and conservation biology through to climate change and livelihoods. Their broad, encompassing experience is reflected in the compendium’s content. The first 7 chapters consider the physical environment. Chapter 1, on the regional setting, discusses Nepal in relation to its surrounding regions and introduces its major climatic and geographic divisions. Chapter 2 comprises the diversity of landscape forms in the region, from the plains of the Terai through the Middle Hills to the alpine regions. Nepal’s ecology and tectonic history is covered in Chapter 3. Chapter 4 contains a very detailed description of climate and weather and presents the known and expected effects of climate change. Rivers, lakes, and glaciers, and the significance of Nepalese and, more widely, Himalayan hydrology—‘‘the water towers of Asia’’—are discussed in Chapter 5. Chapter 6 links Himalayan landforms and processes, including connections between slope stability and plant speciation. The main soil types of Nepal, and their properties and spatial distribution, are described in Chapter 7. The final section of this chapter discusses soil degradation, drawing on some of the most recent research, and makes the link between soil fertility and livestock manures. Chapters 8 to 10 consider the flora and fauna, but also introduce the history of botanical exploration and exploitation in Nepal. The description of the fauna focuses on a range of organisms, illustrating their origin, evolution, and zoogeographic connections that have led to contemporary biodiversity. Chapter 11 discusses the diversity of ethnicities in Nepal. Like other mountainous locations with remote and isolated communities, Nepal has considerable ethnolinguistic diversity. The monarchy of Nepal was abolished in 2008, which may bring about changes after centuries of domination by Hindi high castes; but although there have been indications of change, it is still too early to say. Traditional medicinal systems and ethnobotany, related to the country’s ethnicity and indigenous knowledge, are the subject of Chapter 12. Nepal has a predominantly rural population, so it is unsurprising that indigenous plants contribute to the subsistence of the majority of Nepalese people. Future research must consider the sustainability of harvesting from the wild in relation to the sustainability of rural communities. Chapter 13 looks at the interconnectedness of land use with agriculture, forestry, and pastoralism in each of the nation’s physiographic regions, and discusses geopolitical events and land use even in the most remote regions. Chapters 14 to 16 are integrating; they consider the environmental history of Nepal over time and the effects of global climate fluctuations and increasing human population.

To probe this issue, this research investigated the impact of two levels of crop thinning and of basal leaf removal at three phenological stages in the 2011 and 2012 growing seasons in Michigan. Experiments were conducted at the Southwest Michigan Research and Extension Center (SWMREC) in Benton Harbor. Using ‘Cabernet franc’ (Vitis vinifera L.) vines, yield components (yield per vine, pruning weight, and cluster and berry weight) and basic fruit composition traits [total soluble solids (TSS), pH, titratable acidity, anthocyanins, and phenolics) were studied to investigate the effect of cluster thinning and basal leaf removal on vine performance and fruit quality at harvest. Neither of the treatments significantly impacted TSS in either of the two seasons. Cluster thinning treatment successfully altered cropload ratio, indexed as Ravaz Index (RI), independently of the time of application. Basal leaf removal increased exposed berry temperature, cluster light exposure, and subsequent anthocyanin and phenolic content of the berry in both seasons, again independent of application date, whereas cluster thinning was effective only in 2012. Crop thinning coupled with basal leaf removal resulted in an increased efficiency in anthocyanin accumulation in relation to TSS accumulation, expressed as anthocyanin:sugar, in both years. This is significant because it offers potential for vineyard management practices aiming to improve fruit quality in cool climates where the onset of anthocyanin accumulation could be reduced and decoupled from sugar accumulation. The concentration levels of several chemical components of wine grape, including TSS, organic acids, polyphenols, and flavor compounds, determine technological maturity of fruit at harvest (Mattivi et al., 2006). Together, they are the critical contributors to final wine quality and each constituent responds differently to various environmental factors like sunlight, temperature, humidity, water stress, and soil nutrition (Downey et al., 2006; Lakso and Kliewer, 1975, 1977; Parra et al., 2010; Ryona et al., 2008; Smart and Robinson, 2008; Spayd et al., 2002). Vineyard management is critical to achieve optimal fruit maturity and many viticultural practices have been studied including canopy management, e.g., basal leaf removal, irrigation, soil conditioning, and crop thinning, in cool and hot–warm climates (Bavaresco et al., 2008; Bledsoe et al., 1988; Keller et al., 2005; Reynolds et al, 1996; Sadras and McCarthy, 2007). However, climate often influences cultural treatments and, in viticultural regions like Michigan characterized by cool and short growing seasons of considerable annual variability, the most important tools to achieve desired fruit chemistry and maturity are optimizing vine balance and managing the vine canopy to improve the fruit zone microclimate (Howell, 2001). The ratio between vegetative growth and reproductive growth is manipulated to achieve targeted fruit characteristics and often indexed as cropload, the ratio between fruit yield and 1-year-old cane pruning weight (Ravaz, 1911) or referred to as the RI. Generally, a cropload with an RI from 5 to 10 is considered indicative of a balanced vine (Kliewer and Dokoozlian, 2005). Similar to RI, a ratio of leaf area to fruit weight from 8 to 12 cm·g is also regarded as the hallmark of a balanced vine (Kliewer and Dokoozlian, 2005). For wine grape, an RI exceeding 12 indicates overcropping and less than 5 undercropping vine status, corresponding to leaf area to fruit weight of less of 8 cm·g or more than 14 cm·g, respectively (Kliewer and Dokoozlian, 2005), particularly for vines grown on a vertical shoot positioning trellis (VSP), most common used training system in cool climate viticulture. In a cool climate, with its low heat accumulation [growing degree-days (GDD)] and short growing seasons, a higher amount of leaf area and, therefore, a lower cropload is suggested to ripen the fruit to a desired level (Howell, 2001; Tozzini et al., 2013). Canopy management techniques such as basal leaf removal are frequently used to increase sunlight exposure and exposed berry temperature (Bledsoe et al., 1988; Smart and Robinson, 2008). Cluster exposure increases polyphenols and decreases acidity in cool climates (Cortell and Kennedy, 2006; Downey et al., 2004; Price et al., 1995; Spayd et al., 2002). However, the timing of basal leaf removal appears to be critical; when performed too early, it results in the loss of leaf area with a significant decrease in the amount of photosynthesis and the associated production of carbohydrates for berry development (Palliotti et al., 2011) and the potential of modify the relationship between total soluble solids (mostly sugars) and anthocyanin accumulation, inducing a decoupling effect as reported by Sadras and Moran (2012). This 2-year research project was designed to study the effects of cluster thinning and cluster microclimate (temperature and incident solar radiation) modified by basal leaf removal on vine growth and fruit composition of mature ‘Cabernet franc’ grown in the cool Michigan climate. Specifically, it was our goal to identify the efficacy of selected timings of the two major cultural practices for advancing fruit ripening and achieving targeted quality traits, especially with respect to the concentrations of sugars, anthocyanins, and phenolics at harvest.

The climate here is characterized by a short growing season (145 to 175 d) with cool-climate summer conditions (1300 ± 300 GDD, calculated beginning 1 Apr. to 31 Oct. using base 10 C). The experimental vineyard consisted of 10 rows and 48 vines per row with spacing of 2.4 m between vines and 3.0 m between rows. Rows were planted in a north-to-south orientation and vines were trained with a VSP trellis system. Vines were planted in Spinks sandy loam soil (U.S. Department of Agriculture, 1957) and spurpruned to 48 nodes per vine during the winter. Vines were trained with multiple trunks to ensure survival of at least part of the vine through damaging winter temperatures (Pool and Howard, 1984). During the growing season, shoots were hedged when the tips were 30 cm above the catch wire to maintain a canopy free of excessive shading and, subsequently, to prevent a reduction in heat accumulation (Sadras and Moran, 2012). After bloom, 90 clusters were left on each vine considered in the study. Standard commercial pest-control practices were applied during the season based on scouting, experience, and weather conditions (Wise et al., 2008). Monthly rainfall and cumulative GDD during the growing season were obtained from the Michigan Automated Weather Network station at SWMREC, located 300 m from the site of the experiment. Additional weather data details and parameters can be accessed at <http://www.enviro-weather.msu. edu/weather.php?stn=swm>. Field experimental design and treatments. The experimental design was a randomized complete block with eight blocks and three factors (cropload, leaf removal, and timing of treatment application) and four single vine replications per each treatment. The crop was manually adjusted according to a low crop and high crop level with 40 (40 ± 11 SD in 2011 and 40 ± 10 SD in 2012) and 80 (80 ± 16 SD in 2011 and 80 ± 14 SD in 2012) clusters per vine, respectively. To study the effect of cluster microclimatic conditions on fruit composition and quality, two levels of cluster exposure to sunlight were designed: on selected vines, the first six nodes of each shoot were defoliated (leaf removal), whereas the other treatment was left undefoliated (no leaf removal). The simultaneous application of the yield level and cluster exposure treatments was assigned to three different timings: fruit set, 3 weeks before veraison, and veraison. Canopy growth measurement. Shoot length was monitored weekly from June until hedging, which was performed before veraison (end of July) in both seasons. Five modal shoots per vine were selected and total leaf area was estimated based on the regression between shoot length and shoot leaf area using a non-destructive method. Weekly, 20 shoots were sampled randomly from guard vines from bloom to veraison and shoot length was recorded and leaf area per shoot was measured using a leaf area meter (LI-3100 area meter; LI-COR, Lincoln, NE). The equation of the regression between leaf area and shoot length (y = 23.0 x – 510.7, r = 0.97) was used to estimate leaf area for the five tagged shoots according to Mabrouk and Carbonneau (1996). At the three times of treatment application, six basal leaves were removed from each tagged shoot, placed in zip-lock sampling bags, and transported to the laboratory where their total leaf area was measured and recorded to estimate the percentage of leaf area remov",https://journals.ashs.org/downloadpdf/journals/hortsci/49/6/article-p750.pdf,

Improving our understanding about climate extremes can mitigate the worst impacts of climate change and extremes. The objective here is to investigate the changes in climate and climate extremes by considering two time slices (i.e., 1962–1990 and 1991–2019) in all climate zones of Pakistan by utilizing observed data from 54 meteorological stations. Different statistical methods and techniques were applied on observed station data to assess changes in temperature, precipitation and spatio-temporal trends of climatic extremes over Pakistan from 1962 to 2019. The Mann-Kendal test demonstrated increasing precipitation (DJF) and decreasing maximum and minimum temperatures (JJA) at the meteorological stations located in the Karakoram region during 1962–1990. The decadal analysis, on the other hand, showed a decrease in precipitation during 1991–2019 and an increase in temperature (maximum and minimum) during 2010–2019, which is consistent with the recently observed slight mass loss of glaciers related to the Karakoram Anomaly. These changes are highly significant at 5% level of significance at most of the stations. In case of temperature extremes, summer days (SU25) increased except in zone 4, TX10p (cold days) decreased across the country during 1962–1990, except for zones 1 and 2. TX90p (warm days) increased between 1991–2019, with the exception of zone 5, and decreased during 1962–1990, with the exception of zones 2 and 5. The spatio-temporal trend of consecutive dry days (CDD) indicated a rising tendency from 1991 to 2019, with the exception of zone 4, which showed a decreasing trend. PRCPTOT (annual total wet-day precipitation), R10 (number of heavy precipitation days), R20 (number of very heavy precipitation days), and R25mm (very heavy precipitation days) increased (decreased) considerably in the North Pakistan during 1962–1990 (1991–2019). The findings of this study can help to address some of the sustainable development goals related climate action, hunger and environment. In addition, the findings can help in developing sustainable adaptation and mitigation strategies against climate change and extremes. As the climate and extremes conditions are not the uniform in all climate zone, therefore, it is suggested to the formers and agriculture department to harvest crops resilient to the climatic condition of each zone. Temperature has increasing trend in the northern Pakistan, therefore, the concerned stakeholders need to make rational plans for higher river flow/flood situation due to snow and glacier melt.",https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0271626&type=printable,

Batsch) and has been associated with water stress due to drought (Garcia, 1980; Patten, 1989) or deficit irrigation (Johnson et al., 1992; Larson et al., 1988). Another malady of peach fruit, termed deep suture, also seems to be related to water stress. The symptom of this disorder is a deep cleavage in the suture at the stem end of the fruit that extends at least half way toward the blossom end and renders the fruit unmarketable. Whereas most double fruit can be removed by normal hand thinning, deep sutures are difficult to detect on small fruitlets. Substantial water savings can be achieved without sacrificing yield by withholding irrigation of early maturing peach cultivars after harvest (Johnson et al., 1992). The main disadvantage is the increased number of double fruit and deep sutures. This study was initiated to determine if reirrigation during carpel differentiation in the flower buds (late August) could substantially reduce these disorders while still saving water. A 0.5-ha block of central leader-trained ‘Spring Lady’ peach trees on ‘Nemaguard’ rootstock planted in 1984 at a 3.9 × 2.0-m spacing at the Kearney Agricultural Center, Parlier, Calif., was used for this study. The orchard soil was a Hanford sandy loam (typic xerothents) with ≈400 mm of available water in a 3-m soil profile. A randomized completeblock design was used with two treatments and six replications. A plot consisted of eight trees in a row with two border trees on either end and a border row on either side. The control treatment was irrigated every 1 to 2 d from April through October with one 38 L·h –1 microsprinkler per tree. Amounts were based on estimated evapotranspiration (ET c), calculated from reference crop water use (ET o) and crop coefficients (Kc) for deciduous fruit trees (Goldhamer, 1989). The stressed treatment, initiated after harvest in May 1988, was irrigated at the same frequency but received only 25% of the control volume. In 1989 and 1990, the same treatments were imposed after harvest except that half of the deficit irrigation plots were heavily irrigated during the period of carpel differentiation (late August). In 1989, this “rewatered” treatment received 171% ET c from 18 Aug. to 27 Sept. In 1990, it received 132% ET c from 1 Aug. to 10 Sept. Percentage of double fruit at thinning time was measured on 12 shoots per plot 1 month after bloom. Final numbers of doubles and deep sutures were determined by evaluating every fruit harvested in late May. Statistical analysis was run separately each year and consisted of standard analysis of variance and Duncan’s multiple range test (CoHort Software, Minneapolis, Minn.). Substantial water savings were achieved by reducing irrigation after harvest (Table 1); however, formation of double fruit was extensive (33% to 51%) and similar to levels reported from other studies (Garcia 1980; Johnson et al., 1992; Larson et al., 1988). Even after hand thinning, the stress treatment still had 3% to 4% doubles at harvest, vs. <1% for the control. In addition, deep sutures ranged from 10% to 15% of the harvested fruit in the stress treatment vs. 1% to 4% for the control. Close examination of developing fruit suggests deep sutures start as doubles, but early on one of the two fruit aborts and may not be evident at harvest (Fig. 1, top). However, its presence during early development interferes with proper suture closing of the other fruit. Thus, doubles and deep sutures are both the result of formation of two carpels, caused by water stress. Microscopic observation of 60 flower buds per week in 1988 showed no carpel differentiation on 24 Aug., 22% on 31 Aug., and 90% on 8 Sept., which is similar to other reports from California (Garcia, 1980). Double carpels were also observed at the same time (Fig. 1, bottom). Therefore, in 1989 the rewatered treatment was initiated on 18 Aug. in order to relieve stress by the first week of September. This significantly reduced doubling to ≈21%, but this level was still higher than desired. Accordingly, in 1990 rewatering was initiated on 1 Aug., which reduced doubles to the same level as that found in the fully irrigated control. Doubles and deep sutures at harvest were reduced to control levels in both years. Substantial water savings over the control were still achieved. These data support the conclusion that doubles and deep sutures in fruit from water-stressed peach trees can be reduced to control levels by relieving the stress shortly before and during carpel differentiation.",https://journals.ashs.org/downloadpdf/journals/hortsci/35/4/article-p771.pdf,

A total of 28 WRC reports have been consulted, 13 of these compiled by the University of the Free State, 4 by the University of Fort Hare, and the remainder mainly by the ARC-Institute for Soil Climate and Water. This work has resulted in extensive capacity building in this field – numerous technical assistants and 58 researchers have been involved, of which 23 are still active in research. The focus on the water flow processes in the soil-plant-atmosphere continuum (SPAC), with particular emphasis on processes in the soil, has greatly enhanced understanding of the system, thereby enabling the formulation of a quantitative model relating the water supply from a layered soil profile to water demand; the formulation of logical quantitative defini tions for crop-ecotope specific upper and lower limits of available water; the identification of the harmful rootzone devel opment effects of compacted layers in fine sandy soils caused by cultivation, and amelioration procedures to prevent these effects; and management strategies to combat excessive water losses by deep drainage. The explanation of the way in which SPAC is expressed in the landscape in the form of the ecotope has been beneficial with regard to the extrapolation of studies on particular SPACs to the large number of ecotopes where detailed studies have not been possible. Valuable results are reported regarding rainfall and runoff management strategies. Longer fallow periods and deficit irrigation on certain crop ecotopes improved rainfall use efficiency. On semi-arid ecotopes with high-droughtrisk clay and duplex soils and high runoff losses, in-field rainwater harvesting (IRWH), designed specifically for subsist ence farmers, resulted in maize and sunflower yield increases of between 30% and 50% compared to yields obtained with conventional tillage. An indication of the level of understanding of the relevant processes that has been achieved is demonstrated by their quantitative description in mathematical and empirical models: BEWAB for irrigation, SWAMP mainly for dryland cropping, and CYP-SA for IRWH. Five important related research and development needs are identified. The WRC has played, and continues to play, an important role in commissioning and funding research on water utilisation in agriculture and has clearly made an excellent contribution to the progress made in addressing the needs and requirements of subsistence, emergent and dryland farmers in South Africa.",https://www.ajol.info/index.php/wsa/article/download/72845/61751,

SA uses more than 80% of its water resources for agricultural purposes. Groundwater extractions account for most of this demand, which is not sustainable. Hence, this study aims to analyze water management practices used in SA to propose viable and workable solutions to achieve sustainable management of scarce water resources. This study is based on a critical evaluation of information available on the water sector in SA. About 89% of the water demand in the Kingdom is non-sustainably met through over-pumping from groundwater resources and 9.3% by energy-intensive desalination. SA invested in dams and developed rainwater harvesting to enhance surface water availability and increase the recharge capacity of renewable aquifers. As there is a huge demand–supply gap, water demand management tools are the viable solutions leading to sustainability compared to supply enhancement that is capital intensive. A national agricultural policy, together with a water policy, can make agricultural systems more input efficient with higher productivity. Region-specific sustainable water resources management plans need to be implemented to match the demand–supply gap. Conjunctive water uses utilizing and prioritizing different water sources viz. harvested rainwater, treated wastewater, desalinized water, and groundwater, is vital in sustainable water resources management. In addition, climate change has exerted pressure on the available water resources and water uses as well as users, leading to adaptation for measures that are more sustainable in terms of water management. The most pressing problem SA faces in water resources management is the depletion and degradation of surface and subsurface water sources. SA has to implement many technological and legislative changes in addition to service management, conservation measures, paying a reasonable and justifiable price for water, and strengthening state agencies that will make water resources management in SA sustainable.",https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/15/13/10648/pdf?version=1688622766,

We undertook a qualitative systematic review of academic and policy evidence, to address the question of what interventions are emerging at neigbourhood to city scale to enhance resilience to climate change in Africa. Resilience at neigbourhood scale often stems from harnessing the local resource base and technologies for urban agriculture and forestry; alternative energy from wastes; grassed drainages for protection against erosion; recreation along dry riverbeds; fog-water harvesting; and adjustments in irrigation schedules. At city scale, planning is targeted at buildings, mobility and energy service delivery as the objects to be made resilient. The review established that evidence on comparisons across regions is mainly on East, West and South African cities, and much less on cities in Northern and Central Africa. Ecological comparisons are majorly on coastal and inland cities, with minimal representation of semi-arid and mountainous cities. Resilience efforts in capital cities are the most dominant in the literature, with less emphasis on secondary cities and towns, which is necessary for a deeper understanding of the role played by inter-municipal and inter-metropolitan collaborations. African cities can bring context-sensitivity to global debates on climate resilience, if theoretical perspectives are generated from emerging interventions across case studies. We conclude with suggestions on what future research needs to take on, if evidence on resilience to climate change in African cities is to be strengthened.",https://doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/ab7951,

The proportion of the annual yield originating from the first harvest decreased during the study period and was associated with rising temperatures in summer. Honeybee spring phenology showed strong negative relationships with temperature but no overall change through time because temperatures of key early spring months had not increased significantly.

We develop four scenarios to 2050 with different combinations of high or low agricultural efficiency and high or low meat diets, and use species–energy and species–area relationships to estimate their effects on biodiversity. In our scenarios, natural ecosystems are protected except when additional land is necessary to fulfil the increasing dietary demands of the global population. Biomass energy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) is used as a means of carbon dioxide removal (CDR) from the atmosphere (and offsetting fossil fuel emissions). BECCS is based on waste biomass, with the addition of bio-energy crops only when already managed land is no longer needed for food production. Forecast biodiversity loss from natural biomes increases by more than a factor of five in going from high to low agricultural efficiency scenarios, due to destruction of productive habitats by the expansion of pasture. Biodiversity loss from energy withdrawal on managed land varies by a factor of two across the scenarios. Biodiversity loss due to climate change varies only modestly across the scenarios. Climate change is lowest in the ‘low meat high efficiency’ scenario, in which by 2050 around 660 million hectares of pasture are converted to biomass plantation that is used for BECCS. However, the resulting withdrawal of energy from managed ecosystems has a large negative impact on biodiversity. Although the effects of energy withdrawal and climate change on biodiversity cannot be directly compared, this suggests that using bio-energy to tackle climate change in order to limit biodiversity loss could instead have the opposite effect.",https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/8/2/025024/pdf,

The ever-increasing EFP of humanity is accelerating climate change, increasing water scarcity and contamination, aggravating soil degradation, and dwindling above and below-ground biodiversity. Several sub-components of EFP include resource footprint (RFP) which comprises land (LFP), water (WFP), nitrogen (NFP), biodiversity (BFP) power (PFP), carbon (CFP), etc. Agricultural practices (e.g., tillage, fertilizer and pesticide use, farm operations such as irrigation, harvesting, baling, etc.) also cause the emission of greenhouse gases (GHGs) such as CO2, CH4, and N2O, and these gasses differ in their global warming potential (GWP). In general, CFP is reported as CO2eq by converting CH4 and N2O into CO2. The Human diet, consisting of plant and/or animal-based products and grown diversely with or without chemicals, irrigation, and modern innovations, has a wide range of EFP. The latter, is the widely used measure of resource consumption and humanity’s impact on the planet. EFP encompasses the cumulative GHG emissions by an individual, community, organization, institution, nation for a specific service or product. It can vary widely because of using different reference systems of the studies and differences in system boundaries. Therefore, standardization of the methodologies may require a better understanding of the various ways related CFP concepts are relevant for decisions at individual to global levels. There is no one size that fits all. It is also widely recognized that the global average per capita CFP of humanity, estimated at 4.47 Mg CO2eq in 2020 is not sustainable, and must be reduced to < 2 Mg CO2eqif the global warming is to be limited to 2 0C. Therefore, understanding the magnitude of CFP of agriculture and food systems (FSs), and factors affecting it, can lead to identification of technological options which can enhance the use efficiency of inputs, reduce wastage, and decrease the CFP. Different FSs affect CFP through diverse components of production and supply chains, and in the manner in which food is stored and cooked and the waste is disposed or recycled. There is need to adopt international standard (ISO) protocol. Therefore, this review identifies and deliberates technological options which may be needed for reducing CFP of humanity in general but that of agriculture and FSs in particular, while also advancing Sustainable Development Goals of the Agenda 2030 of the United Nations. CFP of diverse agro-ecosystems, land use and management systems are also discussed. Specific examples of CFP include type of farming systems (organic vs.. conventional, dietary preferences, and food waste). There are several options for the humanity to change lifestyle and make it more sustainable. Food waste, about one-third of all, is an important factor impacting CFP while also accelerating global warming. The impact of avoidable food waste on gaseous emissions, estimated at 2.0 to 3.6 Mg CO2eq per Mg of food waste on dry weight basis, must be minimized.",https://www.oaepublish.com/cf/article/download/4782,

The degradation of land and its resulting impact on other agricultural resources may have further exacerbated the economic and social conditions of the region. The perceived encroachment of Nigeria’s Savannah into its rainforest zone indicated possible land degradation. Some authors attributed this degradation to anthropogenic sources whilst others reported climatic variability (which is nature-driven) as the singular culprit. Therefore, this study reviews the impacts and implications of both human-related and climatic factors on land degradation in Northern Nigeria. Human-related activities such as agricultural/pastoral expansion, agricultural intensification and fuel-wood extraction as well as climatic/physical factors such as rainfall variability and land-atmosphere feedback mechanisms were suggested by various authors as agents of land degradation in Northern Nigeria. The remediation strategies to reduce the impacts of anthropogenic factors include the practice of agroforestry, rainwater harvesting, local irrigation techniques, utilization of wetter sites, contour ridging and terracing to conserve nutrient and water run-off, cautionary expansion of cultivated sites, and the maintenance of a viable seed stock well-suited to variable climatic conditions. The recommendations made on the resulting conflict between crop farmers and pastoralists include a federal government-assisted water project to build more waterpoints at strategic areas in the region and the practice of agropastoralism. However, the controversy over the cause of land degradation in Africa has led to a number of research questions itemised in this paper on the main cause of land degradation, the elements of climate inducing the dryness and wetness of the region, and the extent of land recovery when wet seasons return.",https://doi.org/10.5897/ajest2013.1584,

In particular, it has been demonstrated that species might be affected by both extrinsic threat factors as well as intrinsic biological traits that could render a species more sensitive to extinction; here, we focus on extrinsic factors. Recently, the International Union for Conservation of Nature developed a new classification of threat types, including climate change, urbanization, pollution, agriculture and aquaculture, and harvesting/hunting. We have used this new classification to analyze two main factors that could explain the expected future loss of mammalian phylogenetic diversity: 1. differences in the type of threats that affect mammals and 2. differences in the number of major threats that accumulate for a single species. Our results showed that Cetartiodactyla, Diprotodontia, Monotremata, Perissodactyla, Primates, and Proboscidea could lose a high proportion of their current phylogenetic diversity in the coming decades. In contrast, Chiroptera, Didelphimorphia, and Rodentia could lose less phylogenetic diversity than expected if extinctions were random. Some mammalian clades, including Marsupiala, Chiroptera, and a subclade of Primates, are affected by particular threat types, most likely due solely to their geographic locations and associations with particular habitats. However, regardless of the geography, habitat, and taxon considered, it is not the threat type, but the threat diversity that determines the extinction risk for species and clades. Thus, some mammals might be randomly located in areas subjected to a large diversity of threats; they might also accumulate detrimental traits that render them sensitive to different threats, which is a characteristic that could be associated with large body size. Any action reducing threat diversity is expected to have a significant impact on future mammalian phylogeny.",https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0046235&type=printable,

Biomass burning plays a significant role in air pollution and climate change. In this study, we used a method based on fire radiative energy (FRE) to develop a biomass burning emission inventory for China from 2003 to 2017. Daily fire radiative power (FRP) data derived from 1 km MODIS Thermal Anomalies/Fire products (MOD14/MYD14) were used to calculate FRE and combusted biomass. Available emission factors were assigned to four biomass burning types: forest, cropland, grassland, and shrubland fires. The farming system and crop types in different temperate zones were taken into account in this research. Compared with traditional methods, the FRE method was found to provide a more reasonable estimate of emissions from small fires. The estimated average annual emission ranges, with a 90 % confidence interval, were 91.4 (72.7–108.8) Tg CO2 yr−1, 5.0 (2.3–7.8)  Tg CO yr−1, 0.24 (0.05–0.48) Tg CH4 yr−1, 1.43 (0.53–2.35) Tg NMHC yr−1, 0.23 (0.05–0.45) Tg NOx yr−1, 0.09 (0.02–0.17) Tg NH3 yr−1, 0.03 (0.01–0.05) Tg SO2 yr−1, 0.04 (0.01–0.08) Tg BC yr−1, 0.27 (0.07–0.49) Tg OC yr−1, 0.51 (0.19–0.84) Tg PM2.5 yr−1, 0.57 (0.15–1.05) Tg PM10 yr−1, where NMHC, BC, and OC are nonmethane hydrocarbons, black carbon, and organic carbon, respectively. Forest fires are determined to be the primary contributor to open fire emissions, accounting for 45 % of the total CO2 emissions (average 40.8 Tg yr−1). Crop residue burning ranked second place with a large portion of 39 % (average 35.3 Tg yr−1). During the study period, emissions from forest and grassland fires showed a significant downward trend. Crop residue emissions continued to rise during 2003–2015 but dropped by 42 % in 2015–2016. Emissions from shrubland were negligible and little changed. Forest and grassland fires are concentrated in northeastern China and southern China, especially in the dry season (from October to March of the following year). Plain areas with high crop yields, such as the North China Plain, experienced high agricultural fire emissions in harvest seasons. Most shrubland fires were located in Yunnan and Guangdong provinces.

However, the potential of coupling both methods has not been fully explored. Herein, we aimed to establish a skilled ML–dynamical hybrid model for crop yield forecasting (MHCF v1.0), which hybridizes ML and a global dynamical atmospheric prediction system, and applied it to northern China at the S2S time scale.

The index entails baseline (2005) and prediction (2045) levels based on historic climate data and future-climate modeling. The results of the analysis suggest a wide variation in municipal vulnerability across the country at baseline and prediction points. The vulnerability index shows that highly vulnerable municipalities demonstrate higher climate extremes, which increases uncertainty for harvest periods, and for agricultural yields and outputs. The index shows at baseline that coastal areas host some of the most vulnerable municipalities to climate change in Mexico. However, it also shows that the Northwest and Central regions will likely experience the largest shifts in vulnerability between 2005 and 2045.

The determination of drought-prone areas is essential to select drought-tolerant crops in climate sensitive vulnerable areas. This study aims to enhance the detection of agricultural areas with vulnerability to drought conditions in a heterogeneous environment, taking Bangladesh as a case study. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and land cover products from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite images have been incorporated to compute the vegetation index. In this study, a modified vegetation condition index (mVCI) is proposed to enhance the estimation of agricultural drought. The NDVI values ranging between 0.44 to 0.66 for croplands are utilized for the mVCI. The outcomes of the mVCI are compared with the traditional vegetation condition index (VCI). Precipitation and crop yield data are used for the evaluation. The mVCI maps from multiple years (2006–2018) have been produced to compute the drought hazard index (DHI) using a weighted sum overlay method. The results show that the proposed mVCI enhances the detection of agricultural drought compared to the traditional VCI in a heterogeneous environment. The “Aus” rice-growing season (sown in mid-March to mid-April and harvested in mid-July to early August) receives the highest average precipitation (>400 mm), and thereby this season is less vulnerable to drought. A comparison of crop yields reveals the lowest productivity in the drought year (2006) compared to the non-drought year (2018), and the DHI map presents that the north-west region of Bangladesh is highly vulnerable to agricultural drought.

It may help to improve the simulation of biogeophysical and biogeochemical processes on regional and global scales in the framework of climate and land use change. In this study, the performance of the crop module of the Community Land Model version 5 (CLM5) was evaluated at point scale with site specific field data focussing on the simulation of seasonal and inter-annual variations in crop growth, planting and harvesting cycles, and crop yields as well as water, energy and carbon fluxes. In order to better represent agricultural sites, the model was modified by (1) implementing the winter wheat subroutines after Lu et al. (2017) in CLM5; (2) implementing plant specific parameters for sugar beet, potatoes and winter wheat, thereby adding the two crop functional types (CFT) for sugar beet and potatoes to the list of actively managed crops in CLM5; (3) introducing a cover cropping subroutine that allows multiple crop types on the same column within one year. The latter modification allows the simulation of cropping during winter months before usual cash crop planting begins in spring, which is an agricultural management technique with a long history that is regaining popularity to reduce erosion and improve soil health and carbon storage and is commonly used in the regions evaluated in this study. We compared simulation results with field data and found that both the new crop specific parameterization, as well as the winter wheat subroutines, led to a significant simulation improvement in terms of energy fluxes (RMSE reduction for latent and sensible heat by up to 57 % and 59 %, respectively), leaf area index (LAI), net ecosystem exchange and crop yield (up to 87 % improvement in winter wheat yield prediction) compared with default model results. The cover cropping subroutine yielded a substantial improvement in representation of field conditions after harvest of the main cash crop (winter season) in terms of LAI magnitudes and seasonal cycle of LAI, and latent heat flux (reduction of winter time RMSE for latent heat flux by 42 %). Our modifications significantly improved model simulations and should therefore be applied in future studies with CLM5 to improve regional yield predictions and to better understand large-scale impacts of agricultural management on carbon, water and energy fluxes.</p>",https://gmd.copernicus.org/articles/14/573/2021/gmd-14-573-2021.pdf,

The dynamics and distribution of soil salinity under mulched drip irrigation greatly affect crop growth and yield. However, there are still different views on the distribution and dynamics of soil salinity under long-term mulched drip irrigation due to complex factors (climate, groundwater, irrigation, and soil). Therefore, the soil salinity of newly reclaimed salt wasteland was monitored for 9 years (2008–2016), and the effects of soil water on soil salinity distribution under mulched drip irrigation have also been explored. The results indicated that the soil salinity decreased sharply in 3–4 years of implementation of mulched drip irrigation, and then began to fluctuate to different degrees and showed slight re-accumulation. During the growth period, soil salinity was relatively high at pre-sowing, and after a period of decline soil salinity tends to increase in the late harvest period. The vertical distribution of soil texture had a significant effect on the distribution of soil salinity. Salt accumulated near the soil layer transiting from coarse soil to fine soil. After a single irrigation, the soil water content in the 30–70 cm layer under the cotton plant undergoes a ‘high–low–high’ change pattern, and the soil salt firstly moved to the deep layer (below 70 cm), and then showed upward migration tendency with the weakening of irrigation water infiltration.

While the Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research (EDGAR) focuses on global estimates for the full set of anthropogenic activities, the Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF) sector might be the most diverse and most challenging to cover consistently for all countries of the world. Parties to United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) are required to provide periodic estimates of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, following the latest approved methodological guidance by the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The current study aims to consistently estimate the carbon (C) stock changes from living forest biomass for all countries of the world, in order to complete the LULUCF sector in EDGAR. In order to derive comparable estimates for developing and developed countries, it is crucial to use a single methodology with global applicability. Data for developing countries are generally poor, such that only the Tier 1 methods from either the IPCC Good Practice Guide for Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry (GPG-LULUCF) 2003 or the IPCC 2006 Guidelines can be applied to these countries. For this purpose, we applied the IPCC Tier 1 method at global level following both IPCC GPG-LULUCF 2003 and IPCC 2006, using spatially coarse activity data (i.e. area, obtained combining two different global forest maps: the Global Land Cover map and the eco-zones subdivision of the Global Ecological Zone (GEZ) map) in combination with the IPCC default C stocks and C stock change factors. Results for the C stock changes were calculated separately for gains, harvest, fires (Global Fire Emissions Database version 3, GFEDv.3) and net deforestation for the years 1990, 2000, 2005 and 2010. At the global level, results obtained with the two sets of IPCC guidance differed by about 40 %, due to different assumptions and default factors. The IPCC Tier 1 method unavoidably introduced high uncertainties due to the ""globalization"" of parameters. When the results using IPCC 2006 for Annex I Parties are compared to other international datasets such as (UNFCCC, Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)) or scientific publications, a significant overestimation of the sink emerges. For developing countries, we conclude that C stock change in forest remaining forest can hardly be estimated with the Tier 1 method especially for calculating the C losses, mainly because wood removal data are not separately available on harvesting or deforestation. Overall, confronting the IPCC GPG-LULUCF 2003 and IPCC 2006 methodologies, we conclude that IPCC 2006 suits best the needs of EDGAR and provide a consistent global picture of C stock changes from living forest biomass independent of country estimates.",https://bg.copernicus.org/articles/9/3437/2012/bg-9-3437-2012.pdf,

Yet very little has been done over the years to assess the trends in local rice production to gauge yield potentials and develop new models for improved decision making capability. Accordingly, this paper adopted a mix-scale technique of descriptive statistics and GIS to analyse changing trends in rice production in Niger state. There is a focus on the issues, temporal profile of agricultural trends especially rice production and other crops, the factors and mapping of selected indices. The result shows that despite notable drops in the 1990s, production and land under rice for Niger state surpassed most of its neighbors in every category from 2006 through 2010.

In Sub-Saharan Africa, considerable scientific data exist on use of insects as food and livestock feed. However, coherent policies regarding safety, sustainability, trade and regulation of insects as food and animal feed are lacking. The benefits associated with edible insects are likely to accrue in Sub-Saharan Africa through use of a combination of approaches such as ensured sustainable utilization of edible insects in the wild, preservation of traditional conservation, harvesting and consumption practices, development of captive mass production schemes and strengthening robust value chains to incentivise indigenous participants. Collectively these approaches are referred to as the steward and use of insects as food and animal feed. This paper examines the policy frameworks that exist to support the use of edible insects as food and feed on the African continent.

However, microbial responses to clipping in the context of climate warming are poorly understood. We investigated the interactive effects of grassland warming and clipping on soil properties and plant and microbial communities, in particular, on microbial functional genes. Clipping alone did not change the plant biomass production, but warming and clipping combined increased the C4 peak biomass by 47% and belowground net primary production by 110%. Clipping alone and in combination with warming decreased the soil carbon input from litter by 81% and 75%, respectively. With less carbon input, the abundances of genes involved in degrading relatively recalcitrant carbon increased by 38% to 137% in response to either clipping or the combined treatment, which could weaken long-term soil carbon stability and trigger positive feedback with respect to warming. Clipping alone also increased the abundance of genes for nitrogen fixation, mineralization, and denitrification by 32% to 39%. Such potentially stimulated nitrogen fixation could help compensate for the 20% decline in soil ammonium levels caused by clipping alone and could contribute to unchanged plant biomass levels. Moreover, clipping tended to interact antagonistically with warming, especially with respect to effects on nitrogen cycling genes, demonstrating that single-factor studies cannot predict multifactorial changes. These results revealed that clipping alone or in combination with warming altered soil and plant properties as well as the abundance and structure of soil microbial functional genes. Aboveground biomass removal for biofuel production needs to be reconsidered, as the long-term soil carbon stability may be weakened. IMPORTANCE Global change involves simultaneous alterations, including those caused by climate warming and land management practices (e.g., clipping). Data on the interactive effects of warming and clipping on ecosystems remain elusive, particularly in microbial ecology. This study found that clipping alters microbial responses to warming and demonstrated the effects of antagonistic interactions between clipping and warming on microbial functional genes. Clipping alone or combined with warming enriched genes degrading relatively recalcitrant carbon, likely reflecting the decreased quantity of soil carbon input from litter, which could weaken long-term soil C stability and trigger positive warming feedback. These results have important implications in assessing and predicting the consequences of global climate change and indicate that the removal of aboveground biomass for biofuel production may need to be reconsidered.

Accurate yield prediction depends upon several interactive factors, including crop genotype, climate conditions, soil fertility, sowing & irrigation plan, and crop management practices. For this purpose, remote sensing data and machine learning (ML) algorithms are emerging as indispensable tools that can significantly increase farm productivity while using minimal resources and reducing environmental impact. In this context, the study presents a framework for wheat grain yield prediction using three regression techniques including Random Forest, Xtreme Gradient Boosting (XGB) regression, and Least Absolute Shrinkage & Selection Operator (LASSO) regression. Various aspects of the three models are investigated and results are compared to explore the optimal technique. Drone-based multispectral sensors are employed to acquire data from three wheat experimental fields with three different sowing dates (SD1, SD2, SD3), and the effect of the seeding plan on crop yield is examined. The prediction performance of models is assessed at different growth stages of the crop using several evaluation metrics. The results show that LASSO achieved the highest performance in April with the coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.93 and mean absolute error (MAE) of 21.72.

Cultivation without manuring or fallow phases did not produce satisfying yields, and mono-season cropping on freshly cleared and burned plots resulted in rather high yields, comparable to those produced during modern industrial agriculture - at least ten-fold the ones estimated for the medieval period. Continuous cultivation on the same plot, using imported wood from adjacent areas as fuel, causes decreasing yields over several years. The high yield of the first harvest of a slash-and-burn agriculture is caused by nutrient input through the ash produced and mobilization from the organic matter of the topsoil, due to high soil temperatures during the burning process and higher topsoil temperatures due to the soil’s black surface. The harvested crops are pure, without contamination of any weeds. Considering the amount of work required to fight weeds without burning, the slash-and-burn technique yields much better results than any other tested agricultural approach. Therefore, in dense woodland, without optimal soils and climate, slash-and-burn agriculture seems to be the best, if not the only, feasible method to start agriculture, for example, during the Late Neolithic, when agriculture expanded from the loess belt into landscapes less suitable for agriculture. Extensive and cultivation with manuring is more practical in an already-open landscape and with a denser population, but its efficiency in terms of the ratio of the manpower input to food output, is worse. Slash-and-burn agriculture is not only a phenomenon of temperate European agriculture during the Neolithic, but played a major role in land-use in forested regions worldwide, creating anthromes on a huge spatial scale.",https://www.mdpi.com/2073-445X/6/1/11/pdf?version=1486523399,

The topography, agriculture production systems and environmental constraints are typical of small-scale agricultural subsistence systems related to family farming in the Himalayan Mountains with very low level of mechanization, numerous abiotic stresses influenced by climate and other socio-economic constraints. Quinoa was first introduced in 2015 through FAO’s support to Bhutan as a new crop with the objectives to adapt this versatile crop to the local mountain agriculture conditions as a climate resilient crop for diversifying the farmer’s traditional potato, maize, and based cropping systems, and to enhance the food and nutritional security of the Bhutanese people. Ten quinoa varieties were evaluated at two different sites representing contrasted mountain agro-ecologies in Bhutan and were tested during the two agricultural campaigns 2016 and 2017. Yusipang (2600 m asl) represents the cool temperate agroecological zone, and Lingmethang (640 m asl) the dry subtropical agroecological zone.The sowing time differed depending on the growing season and elevation of the sites. Results indicate that quinoa can be successfully grown in Bhutan for the two different agro-ecological zones. The grain yields varied from 0.61 to 2.68 t ha−1 in the high altitude areas where quinoa was seeded in spring and harvested in autumn season. The grain yield in the lower elevation ranged from 1.59 to 2.98 t ha−1 where the crop was sown in autumn and harvested in winter season. Depending on genotypes’ characteristics, agro-ecology and elevation of the sites and variety; crop maturity significantly varied from 92 to 197 days with all genotypes maturing much earlier in the lower elevations where mean minimum and maximum temperatures during the growing season were higher. Quinoa is rapidly promoted across different agro-ecological contexts in the country as a new climate resilient and nutrient dense pseudo cereal to diversify the traditional existing cropping system with some necessary adjustments in sowing time, suitable varieties and crop management practices. To fast track the rapid promotion of this new crop, four varieties have also been released in 2018. In just over three years, the cultivation of quinoa as a new cereal has been demonstrated and partially adapted to the maize-potato traditional cropping systems under the Himalayan mountain agriculture environment. Quinoa is also being adapted to the rice based cropping system and rapidly promoted as an alternative food security crop in the current 12th Five Year national development plan of Bhutan.",https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0219804&type=printable,

In West Africa, amid the threat posed by climate change on food security, yam production is associated with deforestation and land degradation. Integrated soil fertility management and improved staking options for intensification and sustainable yam production on continuously cropped fields hold the key to addressing this challenge. This review evaluates the last decade's yam production trends in West Africa and in three leading yam-producing countries, Nigeria, Ghana, and Côte d'Ivoire, using the Food and Agriculture Organization Corporate Statistical Database (FAOSTAT) data. A production increase of 1.72, 1.43, and 1.35 times resulted in an area harvest increase of 2.25, 1.23, and 1.59 times in Nigeria, Ghana, and Côte d'Ivoire, respectively. Nigeria and Côte d'Ivoire had the worst yam productivity across the decade by producing at an average yield 17.3 and 12.5%, respectively, of the estimated potential yam yield (50 t ha−1). Even in Ghana, where the productivity increased across the decade, the average productivity was 33% of the estimated potential yield. Thus, it can be observed that the primary reason for the increase in yam production across the globe and in West Africa is mainly because of the increase in area under cultivation in the major yam-producing countries. The projected future erratic rainfall and elevated daily mean temperature as a result of climate change would cause declining tuber yields. Meanwhile, the importation of food such as rice as a strategy to improve food availability cannot be accessed by poor rural households due to the strong correlation between international food price hikes and prices of these foods. However, there is less relationship between international yam price hikes and yam prices in West Africa. Therefore, yam production and sustenance could be vital for food security for the increasing population of West Africa. This study reviews current research on soil fertility and staking options for sustaining yam production on continuously cropped fields. Promotion and adoption of these improved technologies would enhance food security and contribute to achieving Sustainable Development Goals 1 (No poverty), 2 (Zero hunger), 13 (Climate action), and 15 (Life on land).",https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fagro.2022.858114/pdf,

With the help of an extension officer, 200 farmers from 20 communities were randomly selected based on their farming records. Temperatures over the last four decades (1970-2009) increased at a rate of 0.04 (± 0.41) ˚C and 0.3(± 0.13)˚C from 2010-2011 which is consistent to the farmers (82.5%) observations. Rainfall within the districts are characterised by inter-annual and monthly variability. It experienced an increased rate of 0.66 (± 8.30) mm from 1970-2009, which was inconsistent with the farmers (81.5%) observation. It however decreased from 2010-2011 at a huge rate of -22.49 (±15.90) mm which probably was the reason majority of the respondents claim rainfall was decreasing. Only 64.5% of the respondents had adjusted their farming activities because of climate variability and change. They apply fertilizers and pesticides, practice soil and water conservation, and irrigation for communities close to dams. Respondents desire to continue their current adaptation methods but may in the future consider changing crop variety, water-harvesting techniques, change crop production to livestock keeping, and possibly migrate to urban centers. Lack of climate change education, low access to credit and agricultural inputs are some militating factors crippling the farmers’ effort to adapt to climate change.",https://doi.org/10.5539/sar.v5n2p41,

Two pruning systems and three shoot thinning treatments were arranged factorially in a randomized complete block design with four replications. The pruning methods were applied by either handpruning to a target of 25 nodes/m or mechanically hedging and retaining a 100-mm spur height. The shoot density treatments were applied mechanically at a modified EichhornLorenz scale, stage 17 to retain 40 or 45 shoots/m of a row, or left unthinned. The contribution of count shoots to total shoots increased when mechanical box pruning replaced spur pruning. The contribution of percent count shoots to total shoots was greatest with 40 shoots/m and unthinned treatments. The percent photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) transmission and percent canopy gaps increased with mechanical box pruning and also with the decrease in shoot density per meter of row. Berry and cluster size decreased with mechanical box pruning application. However, because mechanically box-pruned vines carried more clusters, yield per meter of row increased. There was a quadratic response to shoot thinning where berry skin phenolics, anthocyanins, and tannins decreased with the 45 shoots/m treatment when compared with 40 shoots/m and unthinned treatments. Pruning weight per meter of row and leaf area-tofruit ratio decreased, whereas Ravaz Index (kg yield/kg pruning weight) increased with mechanical box pruning. Shoot thinning treatments did not affect pruning weight per meter of row or leaf area-to-fruit ratio. Increasing amount of PAR and percent canopy gaps by shoot thinning resulted in vegetative compensation from a sparsely populated grapevine canopy, thereby negating its purported effects. The 40 and 45 shoots/m treatments repopulated the canopy rapidly with non-count shoots thereby increasing the pruning weight per meter of row at the end of the season. In the absence of a physiological response, shoot thinning in a procumbent cultivar is not recommended. Mechanically box pruning to a 100-mm spur height and slowing down vegetative growth by irrigating to 50% of daily evapotranspiration (ETo) variance between fruit set and veraison have resulted in a Ravaz Index window (5 to 10 kg·kg) and is recommended for procumbent red wine grape cultivars for the region with similar or better berry skin phenolic accumulation than spur-pruned vines. The San Joaquin Valley (SJV) of California leads the state in wine grape acreage and tons produced (California Department of Food and Agriculture, 2012). Previously, southern regions of the SJV were classified as only suitable for table grape production (Region V) as a result of their annual growing degree-day (GDD) accumulation (Amerine and Winkler, 1944). However, as the competition for arable land suitable for wine grape production increased in the state, areas that were previously not considered such as Region V are now planted to wine grapes. Much of the wine grapes planted in southern SJV are grown on a twoor three-wire single-curtain, non-shootpositioned trellis (Gladstone and Dokoozlian, 2003) commonly referred to as the California sprawl. This trellis type, although not capitalintensive to install but is often used improperly, results in excessive fruit zone shading with procumbent cultivars, i.e., Syrah (Dokoozlian and Kliewer, 1995; Terry and Kurtural, 2011). Because profit margins are narrow, and maximum yield is paramount, balanced cropping in this region is not possible resulting in large canopies with declining yield and less than ideal fruit composition at the farm gate (Wessner and Kurtural, 2013). The declining yield in southern SJV wine grape vineyards is attributed to mechanical box pruning and irrigating to field capacity that exacerbates the excessive fruit zone shading for procumbent (drooping/trailing growth habit) cultivars (Wessner and Kurtural, 2013). This also results in mutual shading within the canopy in the current season and depresses bud fruitfulness in subsequent seasons (Sanchez and Dokoozlian, 2005). Several studies have shown that node number per vine is a not an accurate or a precise regulator of the final crop level in vineyards (Bernizzoni et al., 2011; Geller and Kurtural, 2013; Poni et al., 2004; Terry and Kurtural, 2011). There is agreement in recent literature that attempts to balance grapevine yield with increased pruning severity fails because of the unpredictable vegetative and reproductive compensating responses from the grapevine (Bernizzoni et al., 2011; Geller and Kurtural, 2013; Kurtural et al., 2006). The compensating responses may include enhanced bursting of secondary shoots (Kurtural et al., 2006; Main and Morris, 2004) as well as more fruitful shoots stemming from latent buds on the cordon and basal buds that are not counted during balanced pruning procedures (Kurtural et al., 2006; Poni et al., 2004). Further enhancements to achieve specific yield targets are therefore achieved with shoot and cluster thinning through manual and mechanical means (Geller and Kurtural, 2013; Kurtural et al., 2006; Terry and Kurtural, 2011). However, these practices require rigorous crop estimation and maybe economically prohibitive (Kurtural et al., 2012) because their application by manual methods may increase labor operation time in the vineyard up to 50 to 60 h·ha (Geller and Kurtural, 2013; Intrieri and Poni, 1995). Shoot thinning in vineyards is applied when average shoot length is between 15 and 25 cm. Smart (1988) reported optimal shoot densities to achieve desired fruit composition and wine sensory properties for cool climate viticulture. He emphasized improved canopy microclimate and function can be achieved with shoot densities of 15 to 25 shoots/m of a row depending on cultivar and location influence. Recently, Geller and Kurtural (2013) recommended a shoot density of 35 shoots/m of a row with a hypocumbent (upright growth habit) cultivar to improve canopy microclimate and to achieve optimum Ravaz Index with a sustainable yield in a warm climate region (Region V of California). Geller and Kurtural (2013) further reported that decreasing shoot density did not provide any further benefit to canopy function. Increasing the severity of shoot thinning resulted in a lack of physiological response as a result of vegetative compensation by the grapevine generating larger leaf area by the remaining shoots on a sparsely populated canopy.

Although there have been various reports on comparisons of mechanical box and spur pruning as well as determination of optimal shoot density in wine grape vineyards, most of these trials were conducted in cooler climates and did not investigate the interaction between them. There are not many specific studies published on mechanical shoot thinning effects on the grapevine grown in Region V with a procumbent grape cultivar such as Syrah. Therefore, our study was designed to investigate how the interaction of pruning systems and mechanical shoot removal affected canopy performance, yield components, fruit phenolic composition at harvest, and production efficiency of a procumbent cultivar in a warm climate region. Materials and Methods Vineyard description and experimental layout This study was conducted from 2009 to 2011 at a commercial vineyard planted with ‘Syrah’ grapevine on ‘SO4’ (V. berlandieri 3 V. riparia) rootstock at 2.1 m 3 3.4-m (vine 3 row) spacing in north to South-oriented rows. The treatments described below were imposed in 2009. Data collection commenced in 2010 to allow the vines to adjust to mechanical manipulation. The research site was located in Kern County, CA (lat. 35 00#322$ N, long. 118 53#808$ W, elevation 137 m) and was planted in 1999 on Premier SandyLoam soil [a coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, calcareous thermic Xeric Torriorthent (U.S. Department of Agriculture, 2011)]. The vines were trained to a bilateral cordon at 1.35 m with two foliage support wires at 1.70 m and a 20-cm T-top. The GDD accumulation at the research site was 2566 and 2561 (10 C base) and 404 mm and 178 mm of precipitation was received in 2010 and 2011, respectively. The vineyard was drip-irrigated with pressure-compensating emitters spaced at 96 cm delivering 1.5 L·h per emitter. The vines were supplied with 12 kg·ha of nitrogen in each year. The vineyard was planted in a resource-limited environment and irrigation was managed uniformly, as follows: the root zone was irrigated beginning in the third week of February based on a crop coefficient (Kc) of 0.2 and 80% of the daily ETo, values for which were obtained from the California Irrigation Management Information System station in Arvin, CA.

We provide insights into the current socioeconomic and biophysical states of the Volta Delta (Ghana), Mahanadi Delta (India) and Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna (India and Bangladesh). Hybrid methods of input-output (IO) construction are used to develop environmentally extended IO models for comparing the economic characteristics of these delta regions with the rest of the country. The main sources of data for regionalization were country level census data, statistics and economic surveys and data on consumption, trade, agricultural production and fishing harvests. The Leontief demand-driven model is used to analyze land use in the agricultural sector of the Delta and to track the links with final demand. In addition, the Hypothetical Extraction Method is used to evaluate the importance of the hypothetical disappearance of a sector (e.g., agriculture). The results show that, in the case of the Indian deltas, more than 60% of the cropland and pasture land is devoted to satisfying demands from regions outside the delta. While in the case of the Bangladeshi and Ghanaian deltas, close to 70% of the area harvested is linked to internal demand. The results also indicate that the services, trade and transportation sectors represent 50% of the GDP in the deltas. Still, agriculture, an activity directly exposed to climate change, plays a relevant role in the deltas’ economies—we have estimated that the complete disappearance of this activity would entail GDP losses ranging from 18 to 32%.",https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/10/3/893/pdf?version=1525344549,

The area is among the most drought-prone and chronically food-insecure parts of the country. The study areas that include the Raya Valley livelihood Zone (RVLZ), Alagie-Offla livelihood Zone (ALOFLZ), and Tsirare Catchment Livelihood Zones (TCLZ) are amongst the most vulnerable and badly affected livelihood zones in the Northwestern Escarpment of the Ethiopian Rift Valley. Hence, this study aimed to monitor the meteorological drought conditions of the three LZs from 1983 to 2016 using the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) at three months’ time scale. Both monthly Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitations with Station data (CHIRPS) and Enhancing National Climate Service (ENACTS) temperature data (1983–2016) at moderate spatial resolution (i.e. 4 km-by-4 km) were obtained from the National Meteorological Agency of Ethiopia. Results This study uncovers seasonally recurring droughts that vary in severity, frequencies, and durations within and between the livelihood zones. The results indicated that severe drought occurred in all livelihoods zone of the study area from years 1983 to 1991, while ALOFLZ and TCLZ have recorded relatively higher drought severity. From 1989 to 2016, the severity and frequency of droughts were increased during the Belg (small rain) season but decreased in Kiremt (summer). In most of the study years, there have been Belg or Kiremt or both drought seasons in the study areas. The severity and frequencies of Kiremt drought in this study were higher from 1983 to 1991, better 1993–1998, and mildly to moderate drought from 2000 to 2016. As the frequencies and persistence of mild drought have increased, the intensity and precipitation amount are too small to cultivate crops and forage growth. This problem needs special considerations on the current moisture harvesting system and afforestation practices to reduce natural and human-induced drought impacts. Conclusions Studying drought with long recorded meteorological data from a large number and uniformly distributed meteorological grids in small scale livelihood zones had great implications to identify the real trends of spatiotemporal meteorological drought. This enabled the researchers to investigate the real drought frequencies, severity, and durations in small scale areas. The study will support to improve the existing drought monitoring system and to build resilience to drought at the household level. The finding also will have a significant contribution to early warning systems, particularly at district levels. Ended, it needs to consider solutions for short and long drought impacts. The agricultural sector should consider the long-cycle crop growth patterns to reduce crop failures and forage problems.",https://environmentalsystemsresearch.springeropen.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s40068-021-00219-3,

Many regions of the northern hemisphere have not experienced a high frequency of meteorological droughts in the past. For understanding the implications of climate change on grassland, analysis of the long-term climate data provides key information relevant for improved grassland management strategies. Using weather data and grassland production data from a long-term permanent grassland site, our aims were (i) to detect the most important drought periods that affected the region and (ii) to assess whether climate changes and variability significantly affected forage production in the last decade. For this purpose, long-term daily weather data (1961–2019) and the standardized precipitation index (SPI), De Martonne index (IDM), water deficit (WD), dryness index (DI), yield anomaly index (YAI), and annual yield loss index (YL) were used to provide a scientific estimation. The results show that, despite a positive trend in DI and a negative trend in WD and precipitation, the time-series trends of precipitation, WD, and DI indices for 1961–2019 were not significant. Extreme dry conditions were also identified with SPI values less than −2.

It should be remembered that there is no single universal mitigation technology suitable for all soils, however, diagnostic based recommendations work satisfactorily for a specific site or location. Prior to setting up soil reclamation plan it is essential to review the available resources (farmer budget, availability and quality of water) and the objectives of reclamation and the reclamation plan established suiting the specific farmer needs.

In rich N soils and under low rainfall conditions (site 1 and 3), intercropping was generally more advantageous for yield (+14%), N yield (+23%), and land use (103 and 119.5% for grain and N yield, respectively) only with reduced N fertilization as assessed using both land equivalent ratio (LER) and land-use efficiency (LUE). Competition dominance was directly affected by changes in climatic conditions over sites; intercropped wheat was more competitive than their respective chickpea under low rainfall conditions. These findings illustrate the crucial role of competitive index assessment in intercropping to promise a robust method for crop N and yield diagnosis during fertilization decision-making.",https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4395/11/6/1225/pdf?version=1634881997,

Wild pea (Pisum fulvum Sibth. & Smith, Pf) accessions sampled across its ecological amplitude in Israel (350–850 mm annual precipitation) were used to assess the genetic diversity for drought responses. We hypothesized that native species evolving under Eastern Mediterranean climate carry adaptive traits to cope with drought stress. Accessions were classified according to single-nucleotide polymorphism variation pattern and habitat ecogeographic parameters. Significant differences were found between the accession groups, but grouping in both systems did not match. Subsequently, 52 Pf accessions and three domesticated pea (P. sativum L.) genotypes were evaluated during 2 yr under well-watered (~580 mm) and water-limited (~340 mm) treatments. Total dry matter, grain yield, harvest index, and average grain weight were higher in domesticated pea than wild Pf; however several Pf accessions exhibited lower drought susceptibility indices (i.e., greater stability across environments) than domesticated genotypes. Of special interest are a number of Pf genotypes in which low susceptibility to water stress was coupled with relatively high productivity. The sampling habitats of those low susceptibility– high productivity accessions are characterized by mild (400–530 mm) annual precipitation. Further sampling and evaluation of Pf from such locations may improve our understanding of pea drought adaptation and yield physiology. E. Naim-Feil, M. Toren, Y. Saranga, and S.

Currently, in an era of rapidly changing civilization, leading to changes in climate and soil conditions, SOM content becomes increasingly important, not only for the proper functioning of ecosys‐ tems, but also for socio-economic development of many regions of the world [1, 2]. In the first half of the past century, there were hardly contradictions between the agricultural culti‐ vation and the environment. The substance circulations were closed, animal production comparatively small and mainly regularly allocated. The mineral fertilization was only used to a slight extent. A fundamental change has taken place during the last decades. With the increasing use of mineral fertilizers, yields have increased by more than 100% thus the quan‐ tity of roots and harvest residues on the field has increased strongly as a source of organic matter.

The aims of the research reported here were to measure NO fluxes over the length of the growing season of wheat and maize crops, and to build a model of soil NO emissions from arable land. Field experiments were carried out on a 1-ha field divided into two parts. The first one was cropped with wheat and harvested in late July, 2002, whereas the second part was sown with maize and harvested in October. The wheat and maize received 130 kg N ha−1 and 140 kg N ha−1, respectively. For each crop, NO fluxes were measured during 10 months every 2 weeks using manual closed chambers, and continuously with a wind tunnel immediately after nitrogen fertilization. Fertilizer application significantly affected NO emissions: the largest NO emissions were recorded a few days after nitrogen application. This delay depended on the kinetics of nitrogen incorporation in the soil, as influenced by rainfall. The emissions measured on the maize field (2.6% of the fertilizer amount applied) were more important than those on the wheat field (1.0% of the fertilizer amount applied), owing to differences in timing of nitrogen application, with respect to climate and crop growth. Relationships between soil nitrification rate and NO emission obtained from laboratory incubations, and experimental data appeared useful and relevant to predict NO emissions at the field-scale.",https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00023220/file/Laville2005.pdf,

Due to the migration of agricultural labor in non-farm sectors and increasing climate vulnerability, it is a great challenge to keep pace of food production for the exponential growth of population, especially in the developing countries. Hence, the main aim of this study was to examine the present status and impact of modern rice harvesting practices over traditional manual harvesting. In order to investigate the interactions between modern rice harvesting technologies and benefits of use, we reviewed overall scenarios of rice harvesting in the world along with identified problems due to present practices and the benefit of using modern technologies including precision agriculture. The major findings of this study were as follows: agriculture in most of the developing countries were characterized by low productivity due to less practice of modern technologies, less management of modern technologies, inadequate control of repeated crop losses due to natural calamities. Identified problems in traditional manual rice harvesting were: labor crisis at peak harvesting period, high harvesting cost as the traditional method was labor intensive and high labor wages, delayed harvesting due to the unavailability of labors, more grain/yield losses owing to the over maturity. Furthermore, identified benefits in modern rice harvesting practices were to save harvesting time, cost and labor involvement with reducing grain/yield loss and human drudgery. The further benefits were enhancing the income through custom hire services and creating a new employment opportunity in technology operation and maintenance. The results indicated that adoption of appropriate rice harvesting technology in the developing countries is urgently needed to increase the cropping intensity, crop productivity and economic emancipation through less inputs of time, labor and cost.",https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/ras/8/0/8_89/_pdf,

Allometry is a cost-effective approach to estimate plant biomass, but few studies – focused mainly on permanent structure carbon fixation – have dealt with it in grapevine. This study develops allometric models that accurately estimate grapevine standing biomass (total vine biomass at harvest), using extensive field-collected data sets. Methods and Results Data were obtained in vineyards located in Spanish regions representative of the variability found in warm semi-arid Mediterranean regions. We developed and validated functions to estimate vine biomass for all vine organs. The models obtained estimated accurately the biomass fixed by each organ separately and even more accurately at the whole plant scale. To illustrate the potential of the models, they satisfactorily assessed the influence of seasonal vine water status on vine biomass production and partitioning using an independent data set. Conclusions and Significance of the Study The models constitute a powerful tool to determine in a non-destructive and cost-effective manner standing biomass from simple vine measurements, which makes them suitable for quantifying carbon stocks and allocation patterns, and for evaluating the influence of climate or cultural practices at large scale to estimate better – at a regional or international level – the contribution of grapevine culture to CO2 balances.",https://doi.org/10.1111/ajgw.12285,

This study evaluated the extent of bare grounds in Nakasongola, one of the districts in the Cattle Corridor of Uganda and the yield responses of maize (Zea mays) and common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) to different tillage methods in the district. Bare ground was determined by a supervised multi-band satellite image classification using the Maximum Likelihood Classifier (MLC). Field trials on maize and bean grain yield responses to tillage practices used a randomized complete block design with three replications, evaluating conventional farmer practice (CFP); permanent planting basins (PPB); and rip lines, with or without fertilizer in maize and bean rotations. Bare ground coverage in the Nakasongola District was 187 km2 (11%) of the 1741 km2 of arable land due to extreme cases of soil compaction. All practices, whether conventional or the newly introduced conservation farming practices in combination with fertilizer increased bean and maize grain yields, albeit with minimal statistical significance in some cases. The newly introduced conservation farming tillage practices increased the bean grain yield relative to conventional practices by 41% in PPBs and 43% in rip lines. In maize, the newly introduced conservation farming tillage practices increased the grain yield by 78% on average, relative to conventional practices. Apparently, conservation farming tillage methods proved beneficial relative to conventional methods on degraded soils, with the short-term benefit of increasing land productivity leading to better harvests and food security.",https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/9/7/1084/pdf?version=1498826915,

This study looked at communities’ perception of climate change impacts, barriers and effective adaptation strategies towards climate change in selected districts of western Oromia. This study examines smallholder farmers’ perceptions of climate variability, climate change and its impacts on crop production, and adaptation strategies adopted over the past three 30 years. Survey data were collected from 204 respondents using both qualitative and quantitative approaches through purposive sampling techniques. Descriptive statistics such as percentage and frequency were used for data analysis. The results of the study showed that the respondents were perceived, the occurrence of climate change in terms of increase in temperatures, decrease in rainfall and change in timing of rain, change in the onset of rains, erratic rainfall pattern. The study also indicated that due to climate change induced factors the agricultural productivity was reduced from time to time. The results show that about 80%) of farmers who participated had observed recent changes in climate. Perceptions of local communities on climate change and variability are consistent with the analyzed historical climate data. The analyzed climate data show fluctuations in onset date, cessation date and length of growing season (LGS) and change in climate. Farmers perceived weather related problems such as low rain, drought, flood, heat, cold, strong wind that led increased farming problems such as soil erosion, loss of soil fertility; reduction in crop yields and high rate of disease occurrence. The impacts of climate change on crop production were revealed by changes in start of farming season; including: rainfall coming early or late, decrease in rainfall, increase in temperature and increase in farming problems, in particular, increase in soil erosion, loss of soil fertility and reduction in crop yields. The results showed that farmers perceived climate change in terms of changes in rainfall and temperature, increase in drought condition, crop pests and diseases. Those changes had significant impact on farmers’ households whose income depends on rain fed farming. The findings revealed that the impacts of climate in rural areas include reduced in crop yield (49%); increase in pest and disease (34%) and soil erosion (98%). Respondents perceived the main cause of climate change was human action through; intensified agriculture, deforestation, increased use of fossil fuel and use of chemical fertilizer on farms. Therefore, to adapt to the changing in climate, farming community practiced some adaptation measure. The adaptation measures identified were soil and water conservation, crop rotation, change crop varieties, change planting dates, late planting, diversification of crop types and varieties, drought resistant varieties, building water harvesting schemes and use of irrigation. Widely used adaptation measures are soil and water conservation, crop rotation, changing planting dates and change crop varieties in the study area. Besides, the finding identified some serious barriers of adaptation measure to climate change including lack of information, shortage of labor, lack of capital, black of access to water and poor potential for irrigation. Therefore, there is a need to focus community dimensions such as perceptions of smallholder farmers. The study recommends enhanced knowledge of climate change and climate smart agriculture practices for their improved adoption.",https://doi.org/10.4172/2332-2594.1000216,

Labile and stable fractions of C and N were determined at seven different time points from 0–15 cm depth during tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) growing season in 2015 and 2016 (referred to as site-years). As expected, over the tomato growing season in both site-years, organic C (OC) and total N did not change while the labile C and N fractions changed with greater concentrations observed at 2 weeks after tillage (WAT) and greater treatment differences observed for seven out of eleven soil attributes at tomato harvest. Therefore, 2WAT (early June) and tomato harvest (early September) are reasonably optimum sampling times for soil C and N attributes. Seasonal variation of labile fractions suggested the potential impact of substrate availability from crop residues on soil C and N cycling. Medium-term CC usage enhanced the surface soil C and N storage.

However, this process may be one of the sources of phthalate esters (PAEs) in agricultural soils, and the potential risks of PAEs for soil ecosystems and human health have attracted considerable attention. A two-year (from October 2014 to October 2016) field experiment was conducted to assess the contamination risk of PAEs from reclaimed irrigation water in winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and summer maize (Zea mays L.) fields on the North China Plain. Three types of irrigation water quality were arranged for each variety, including reclaimed water, groundwater, and a mixture of reclaimed water and groundwater (1:1, v/v). The results indicate that the concentrations of the 6 PAEs in topsoil ranged from 2.79 to 5.34 mg/kg at the time of crop harvest. There was no significant effect of reclaimed irrigation water on the concentrations of PAEs in the soil. Di-n-butyl phthalate (DnBP) and di (2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) were the most abundant contaminants in all soil samples, accounting for 43.2%~68.7% and 27.1%~48.6%, respectively, of the 6 PAEs. The levels of dimethyl phthalate (DMP) and DnBP in all soil samples exceeded the allowable soil concentrations, but the levels were far below the recommended soil cleanup objectives. The grain yields of winter wheat and summer maize ranged from 4.35 to 7.1 t/ha and 1.03 to 6.46 t/ha, respectively. There were no significant effects of reclaimed water on the growth characteristics and grain yield of winter wheat (p > 0.05); however, the effect of reclaimed irrigation water on summer maize was influenced by climate. The concentrations of the 6 PAEs in wheat grain and maize grain ranged from 1.03 to 4.05 mg/kg and from 0.37 to 3.29 mg/kg, respectively. For the same variety, there was no significant difference in the concentrations of the 6 PAEs in cereal grains among different treatments (p > 0.05). DEHP and DnBP were the most abundant components in most crop samples, accounting for 31.6%~77.9% and 21.1%~64.7%, respectively, of the 6 PAEs. The concentrations of the PAEs, DnBP and DEHP in cereal grains were lower than those in the reference doses. The BCFs of the 6 PAEs and of each PAE in cereal grains were 0.43~1.25 and 0.33~35.75, respectively. The BCFs of butyl benzyl phthalate (BBP) were the highest (1.41~35.75), followed by DMP and DEHP. There were almost no significant differences in the BCFs of each PAE among the three treatments. The total carcinogenic risks of PAEs were 2.82 × 10−5 for adults and 1.81 × 10−5 for children. The total non-carcinogenic risks of PAEs were 3.37 × 10−1 for adults and 7.98 × 10−1 for children. DHEP was the dominant contributor to both risks, and the intake of cereals was the main exposure pathway for the two risks. In conclusion, there were no significant effects of reclaimed irrigation water on the concentrations of PAEs in soil and cereal grains compared with groundwater irrigation, and the human health risks were within the acceptable range. Long-term studies are needed to evaluate the long-term effects of reclaimed irrigation water on the contamination risk posed by PAEs.",https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4441/10/8/999/pdf?version=1532742199,

The cost-effectiveness of transgenic plants increases if simple cultivation facilities such as greenhouses can be used for production. In such a setting, we expressed a novel affinity ligand based on the fluorescent protein DsRed, which we used as a carrier for the linear epitope ELDKWA from the HIV-neutralizing antibody 2F5. The DsRed-2F5-epitope (DFE) fusion protein was produced in 12 consecutive batches of transgenic tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) plants over the course of 2 years and was purified using a combination of blanching and immobilized metal-ion affinity chromatography (IMAC). The average purity after IMAC was 57 ± 26% (n = 24) in terms of total soluble protein, but the average yield of pure DFE (12 mg kg−1) showed substantial variation (± 97 mg kg−1, n = 24) which correlated with seasonal changes. Specifically, we found that temperature peaks (>28°C) and intense illuminance (>45 klx h−1) were associated with lower DFE yields after purification, reflecting the loss of the epitope-containing C-terminus in up to 90% of the product. Whereas the weather factors were of limited use to predict product yields of individual harvests conducted for each batch (spaced by 1 week), the average batch yields were well approximated by simple linear regression models using two independent variables for prediction (illuminance and plant age). Interestingly, accumulation levels determined by fluorescence analysis were not affected by weather conditions but positively correlated with plant age, suggesting that the product was still expressed at high levels, but the extreme conditions affected its stability, albeit still preserving the fluorophore function. The efficient production of intact recombinant proteins in plants may therefore require adequate climate control and shading in greenhouses or even cultivation in fully controlled indoor farms.",https://fjfsdata01prod.blob.core.windows.net/articles/files/474734/pubmed-zip/.versions/1/.package-entries/fpls-10-01245.pdf?sv=2018-03-28&sr=b&sig=a9m0d7qzg8pYaaIRxgmGKv7yqK%2BVGPqU7DhIwKNRwXU%3D&se=2021-02-22T04%3A35%3A47Z&sp=r&rscd=attachment%3B%20filename%2A%3DUTF-8%27%27fpls-10-01245.pdf,

Rice production in the subtropical environment in Bangladesh is mostly dependent on synthetic inorganic fertilizer to maintain productivity; however, the inorganic fertilizer has negative effects on global warming. Climate-smart and resilient agricultural production systems are major concerns nowadays to meet sustainable development goals. The study was conducted to evaluate the optimum rate and source of organic amendments on rice productivity and soil fertility along with CH4 emission. A total of nine nutrient combinations were used in the study. The CH4 emission, soil redox potential (Eh), soil pH, soil nitrogen and organic carbon, available phosphorus, rice grain and straw were greatly affected by the application of different rates and sources of the nutrient. However, the soil exchangeable K content, plant height, and harvest index were not affected. Among the treatments, the application of 75% recommended fertilizer (RF) + biosolid 2 t ha−1 (T3) was the most effective and showed the superior performance in terms of available P (12.90 ppm), the number of grains panicle−1 (121), and 1000-grain weight (24.6g), rice grain, and straw yield along with the moderate CH4 emission (18.25 mg m−2h−1). On the other hand, the lowest soil Eh (−158 mV) and soil pH (6.65) were measured from the treatment T3. The finding of this study revealed that the application of 75% of RF + biosolid 2 t ha−1 can be recommended as the preferable soil amendment for boosting rice yield, reduce CH4 emissions, and sustainably maintain soil fertility.

Quantitative and qualitative approaches (Rapid Rural Appraisal, focus group discussions, and semi – structured interview schedule) were used to elicit information from a total of 500 farmers, which were selected using multistage random sampling technique. Findings revealed that 84% and 79% of the farmers were aware and knowledgeable of climate change issues, respectively, while 81% of them noted that they had at various times experienced climate change incidences. Farmers reported that factors which informed their perception of climate change incidence were: unusual early rains followed by weeks of dryness (M= 2.84), erratic rainfall pattern (M= 2.66), drought (M=2.68), reduction in farm yields (M=2.68) and high rate of disease incidence (M= 2.67). Adaptive measures used by the farmers in northern Nigeria included: changes in planting dates (88.4%) and harvesting dates (85.4%), multiple cropping (81.8%), intensive manure application (69.2%), shift to different sites (56.8%) and use of wetland/river valley (fadama) for farming (52.6%). The study concludes that there is need for government to make concrete efforts to enact appropriate policies on climate change adaptation and assist local farmers in the short and long term to improve their resilience to climate change impact.",https://www.ajol.info/index.php/jae/article/download/84515/74517,

This field study took place in to gain insight into the effects of seasonal rainfall, tillage and crop systems on wheat yield and weed parameters. Conventional (CT), minimum (MT) and no-tillage (NT) systems in wheat monoculture and rotation cropping systems were tested during 3 years of study (2014–2015, 2015–2016 and 2016–2017). Growing Season Rainfall (GSR) was the most influential factor on yield parameters and weed population. In 2016–2017, categorized as an extreme climate event by drought, the GSR accounted for 43.4% of the historical average. This year, the wheat yield (373 kg ha−1) and harvest index (0.18) were the lowest. In 2015–2016, scarcer autumn rainfall (44 mm) affected the weed germination period, reducing the density (17 plants m−2) and diversity of weed species (3 species m−2) while yield was favoured by high winter and spring rainfall (247 mm). Our study revealed that tillage effects was not significant on wheat yield, but NT systems consistently showed higher weed density and diversity than CT and MT despite the irregular GSR during this study. The rotation system presented higher values of wheat grain yield (781 kg/ha) and dry straw biomass (1803 kg/ha) but also weed biomass (48.54 g m−2) compared to monoculture (27.50 g m−2).

The eggplant is a warm-climate crop of high economic importance. In many Asian and Mediterranean countries, eggplants are essential components of everyday dishes, while in Central Europe they have become popular only in recent years. Eggplants are harvested at an immature stage and have low storage value; therefore, the sale of fruits in local markets requires an appropriate production strategy. In Poland, consumer demand for eggplants is currently met by imports and domestic production, which, until recently, has been carried out only in greenhouses, ensuring the availability of fresh fruits but resulting in high selling prices. The demand for eggplants is growing among Polish consumers, and, accordingly, field production is expected to gradually gain in importance due to the fruit’s profitability. Accordingly, the biology and farming practices of this warm-climate crop remain in the investigation phase in temperate climate. This review aims to report the status of current knowledge regarding the technologies affecting the biology, cultivation, and nutritional value of eggplant grown in temperate climatic zone.",https://www.agriculturejournals.cz/publicFiles/36_2016-HORTSCI.pdf,

Twelve Landsat 8 images were used to retrieve monthly LST, to characterize the urban thermal environment, and spectral mixture analysis was employed to estimate the effect of the driving factors, and correlation and linear regression analyses were used to explore their relationships. Results indicate that, (1) the spatial pattern of LST has dramatic monthly and seasonal changes. August has the highest mean LST of 38.11 °C, whereas December has the lowest (−19.12 °C). The ranking of SUHI intensity is as follows: summer (4.89 °C) > winter with snow cover (1.94 °C) > spring (1.16 °C) > autumn (0.89 °C) > winter without snow cover (−1.24 °C).

Irrigation technologies and irrigation scheduling may be adapted for more effective and rational uses of limited water supplies.

Being a cool-season crop, lettuce is particularly vulnerable to heat stress. To adapt to climate change, this study was conducted to evaluate the performance of leaf lettuce genotypes for heat tolerance by growing them in different locations within California that differ in temperatures during the growing season. Fifteen green leaf and 21 red leaf lettuce genotypes were selected to evaluate their performance under these environments. These genotypes were planted inMarch andMay in Five Points (San Joaquin Valley) and El Centro (Imperial Valley) and in June 2012 in Salinas (Salinas Valley). The results suggest that lettuce planting can be extended from January toMarch beyond the normal growing seasons in San Joaquin and Imperial Valleys, where yield may be higher than in the Salinas Valley. The further delay in planting date from March to May in Five Points and El Centro resulted in reduction of yield and an increase in susceptibility to bolting and heat-related disorders such as tipburn and leaf desiccation in most genotypes. The susceptibility to these disorders depends on the genotype and the temperature during lettuce growth and maturation. However, heat-tolerant leaf lettuce genotypes adapted to these regionswere identified. Results of this research should be useful for the development of heat-tolerant lettuce cultivars and for extending the growing season in warmer but lower land cost areas to reduce production costs. Lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.) is a coolseason crop; it achieves optimum growth and development at an average temperature of 18 C. Production of lettuce at higher temperature ranges resulted in losses of yield and quality and led to some physiological disorders such as rib discoloration, tipburn, premature bolting, and ribbiness (Jenni, 2005; Jenni and Yan, 2009; Ryder, 1999). These physiological disorders were influenced by genotype, environment, and the interaction between the genotype and the environment (Jenni and Yan, 2009). Tipburn is one of the physiological disorders associated with heat stress and the symptom appears as brown necrosis around the margin of the affected leaves. This disorder is also believed to be associated with calcium deficiency (Barta and Tibbitts, 2000; Thibodeau and Minotti, 1969), and typically develops during rapid plant growth at high temperatures (Cox et al., 1976; Yanagi et al., 1983). Lettuce seed germination is also influenced by high temperature stress (Argyris et al., 2008; Gray, 1975; Kozarewa et al., 2006; Lafta and Mou, 2013; Sung et al., 1998; Thompson et al., 1979). The inhibition of seed germination at high temperatures (thermodormancy) caused a reduction in field emergence, stand establishment, and yield (Cantliffe et al., 1981; Valdes et al., 1985). Climate change over the next few decades will have profound impacts on agricultural and food systems. The average temperature worldwide is predicted to increase, which may negatively impact the agricultural production and food availability (Karl and Trenberth, 2003; Wurr et al., 1996). Heat tolerance is the ability of plants to grow and perform well under high temperature stress. Development of new crop cultivars that tolerate high temperatures and perform well under warmer and drier climate conditions may mitigate the negative impact of climate change. Breeding and selection for growth, yield, and quality under high temperature stress are important objectives of lettuce breeders working in these environments. Being a cool-season crop, lettuce is vulnerable to global warming. In this study, we evaluated green and red leaf lettuce germplasm collections for their tolerance to high temperatures to find heat-tolerant genotypes. Field screening for heat tolerance involved growing lettuce germplasm accessions in different environments (different locations) and then comparing the yield and other plant characteristics at these environments to find the best cultivars that perform well under high temperature stress conditions. To ensure year-round supply of products in the United States, most of the lettuce production concentrates in the Salinas Valley, CA, from late spring to early fall, switches to the San Joaquin Valley, CA, in the spring and fall, and shifts to the Imperial Valley, CA, and the Yuma Valley, AZ, in winter. In regions such as the Imperial, San Joaquin, and Yuma Valleys, lettuce is usually planted in the fall or winter (up to January) to allow the crops escape the warmer conditions. Identifying lettuce cultivars that perform well in the field at high temperatures will make it possible to plant lettuce in spring, which in turn will help in expanding the growing season in these warmer areas. Selecting and developing lettuce cultivars suited to these areas will also reduce crop loss and improve the economic opportunity for lettuce producers. Materials and Methods Plant material. Fifteen green leaf cultivars and 21 red leaf lettuce genotypes (20 cultivars and one germplasm accession) were selected through a preliminary screening of more than 1000 genotypes for leaf injury, fresh weight, and survival of seedlings at 43 C day/35 C night for 12 h in a growth Received for publication 1 Apr. 2016.

The putative heat-tolerant genotypes, along with heat-sensitive and commercial cultivar controls, were selected to test their responses to high temperature stress by growing them in different field environments. These genotypes were planted and grown at the University of California (UC) West Side Research and Extension Center in Five Points in the San Joaquin Valley (5 Mar. to 15 May and 8 May to 10 July 2012), UC Desert Research and Extension Center in El Centro in the Imperial Valley (7 Mar. to 9 May and 9 May to 2 July 2012), and USDA-ARS Agricultural Research Station in Salinas (26 June to 20 Aug. 2012) in the Salinas Valley of California. The experiments were arranged in a randomized complete block with four replications per treatment. The experiment units consisted of one row per entry. All plantings were directly seeded in 6-m-long rows with 35 cm between rows on a 1-m-wide double row–raised bed. Plants were hand thinned to 30 cm apart in the row about 3 weeks after planting, leaving 20 plants in each plot. The weather data during the growing seasons at the trial sites are shown in Table 1. At the Five Points site, 168 kg·ha of monoammonium phosphate (11N–52P2O5–0K) fertilizer (18.5 kg·ha of N and 38.2 kg·ha of P) was incorporated into the soil preplant; then 112 and 135 kg·ha of N as monoammonium phosphate were side dressed into the beds about 40 d after planting for the March and May plantings, respectively. A postplant preemergence herbicide pronamide (Kerb; Dow AgroSciences, Indianapolis, IN) was applied at 5.8 L·ha. At the El Centro site, 224 kg·ha of monoammonium phosphate (24.6 kg·ha of N) fertilizer was incorporated into the beds preplant; then 56 kg·ha of urea-ammonium nitrate (32N, 17.9 kg·ha of N) was applied through irrigation water 16 and 23 d after planting, respectively, followed by 112 kg·ha of urea (46N, 51.5 kg·ha of N) side dressed into the beds 40 and 34 d after planting, for the March and May plantings, respectively. Pronamide (Kerb) herbicide was applied at 3.4 kg·ha. At the Salinas site, a 6N–20P–20K fertilizer at 336 kg·ha (20.2 kg·ha of N, 67.2 kg·ha of P, 67.2 kg·ha of K) was applied before field preparation, followed by 336 kg·ha of ammonium sulfate (21N–24S, 70.6 kg·ha of N, 80.6 kg·ha of S) side dressed 23 and 38 d after planting. Postplant preemergence herbicides pronamide (Kerb, 3.5 L·ha) and bensulide (Prefar 4-E; Gowan Co., Yuma, AZ, 4.7 L·ha) were applied. After planting, all plots were irrigated overhead with sprinklers (3–7 times a week till emergence, followed by two times a week till maturity) except the El Centro site where the fields were furrow irrigated once a week following seedling emergence. At market maturity, five plants were randomly harvested from each plot and evaluated for yield (g/plant without roots), plants bolted (% of plants with elongated stems), tipburn incidence (number of leaves with brown or black edges/plant), and heat-damaged leaves (number of leaves with areas desiccated from heat stress/plant). Statistical analysis. Analysis of variance was conducted using the JMP program (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC) to determine the effect of environment (E), genotype (G), and the interaction between genotype and environment (GE). Treatment means were separated by the least significant difference at the 0.05 level of probability. The correlation coefficients were determined using the JMP program. The analysis of GGE biplots (Yan and Kang, 2003; Yan et al., 2007) was conducted for the traits measured to show the performance of genotypes among test environments. The analysis was done using GGE biplot software (Yan, 2001). The which-won-where patterns of the GGE biplots visualize the similarities among the environments in discriminating the genotypes.

The countries were grouped into three clusters to facilitate comparative analysis of the data generated. Primary and secondary data were collected using questionnaire, participant observation and focus group discussions while secondary data were obtained through in-depth literature review. Descriptive statistics were mainly employed in data analysis. Results show that the most prominent adaptation measures in Nigeria, Sierra Leone and Liberia were; processing of crops to reduce post-harvest losses; increased weeding; mulching; increased manure application; movement to a different farm site; use of agrochemicals; and prayers for God’s intervention. In Ghana and the Gambia, most of the farmers did not do anything but relied on God’s intervention. However, others embarked on regular weeding, construction of drainage systems and trenches, and use of agrochemicals. They also referred difficult cases to extension agents. In Cameroon, Equatorial Guinea and the Central African Republic, farmers, resorted to late planting, blocking of drainage in rice fields to conserve water, multiple cropping; planting crops with different maturity periods, use of wood ash, and urban cropping. The study recommends more interaction of relevant stakeholders including farmers, extension agents, civil society actors, private sector actors and government in generating suitable agricultural innovations for climate change adaptation and food security in the regions.

The effects of these OFMS on weed management, soil conditions, tree growth, tree yield, fruit quality, and fruit storage potential in a cool climate were evaluated. Acetic acid treatment showed good weed suppression without any amendatory effect on soil conditions, fruit quality, or tree performance. The L and SSS systems increased soil respiration, decreased tree vigor, and improved fruit quality, but had no sufficient influence on weed competition and thus decreased fruit yield. Only SSW gave better weed control, higher soil respiration, and acceptable tree growth with no yield reduction. Fruit from this system also showed better quality at harvest than fruit from other OFMS and maintained this good quality during storage. A 6-week weed-free period from late May to mid-July gave the highest apple yield in two OFMS (SSW and V). Apple trees are relatively poor competitors with other vegetation because of their low root density per unit of soil, 1 to 10 cm root per cm compared with 10 cm per cm for grasses (Neilsen and Neilsen, 2003). Therefore, high tree productivity depends on low weed competition (Granatstein, 2003; Weibel and Häseli, 2003). In organic apple orchards, floor vegetative cover can be used to improve soil fertility and moisture retention, control soil erosion, increase yield, and develop fruit quality and storage potential, as well as reducing weed competition (Granatstein and Mullinix, 2008; Stefanelli et al., 2009; Zoppolo et al., 2011). Herbicides are recognized as being a highly effective and relatively inexpensive method for limiting weed competition (Merwin, 2003). However, use of herbicides is very restricted in integrated apple production and they cannot be used in organic orchards as a result of potential adverse effects on the environment, human health, soil microbial activities, and groundwater quality (Atucha et al., 2011; Glover et al., 1999; Merwin et al., 1995). Tillage within the tree row is a widely used weed control strategy in organic orchards. New equipment for weed control, which permits tillage between adjacent tree trunks, improves tree vegetative growth efficiency (TerAvest et al., 2010). However, tillage can have negative effects on the growth of young trees (Hogue and Neilsen, 1987) and on soil quality (Hoagland et al., 2008). It also increases nitrogen leaching from the root zone (Weidenfeld et al., 1999), impedes internal water drainage (Merwin and Stiles, 1994), disrupts surface roots (Cockroft and Wallbrink, 1996), and lowers soil cation exchange capacity and soil organic matter content (Wooldridge and Harris, 1991). To avoid these negative impacts, mechanical tillage should be replaced with new floor management systems that are productive under the constraints of organic fruit growing (Delate et al., 2008). Acetic acid (vinegar) has been shown to be effective as a non-selective herbicide in controlling some weeds (Johnson et al., 2004). It is used as weed killer in organic orchards in the United States and it is authorized in several European countries such as Belgium, Denmark, France, Sweden, and the United Kingdom, where concentrations of up to 240 g·L are used (Delate et al., 2005; SANCO, 2013). However, acetic acid may show poor suppression at low doses, damage low-hanging leaves on apple trees, and decrease soil pH (Markhart et al., 2005). Although different natural and artificial mulches (such as legume biomass, wood chips, aluminum, bark, propylene) suppress weeds, maintain soil moisture, affect soil temperature, increase organic matter, and enhance soil microbial activities, their use is still restricted because they are expensive and labor-intensive (Sanchez et al., 2003; Tahir et al., 2005; Yao et al., 2005). They may also increase the populations of rodents and other pests (Granatstein and Mullinix, 2008; Merwin et al., 1999). Establishment of one or more crops in the tree row (living mulch) to prevent weed competition can produce conflicting effects. In some studies it improved soil fertility and water-holding capacity (Merwin et al., 1994), but in others, it decreased root and shoot growth (Atucha et al., 2013; Merwin and Stiles, 1994), delayed fruit maturity, and reduced yield as a result of competition with the fruit trees (Goh and Ridgen, 1995; Marsh et al., 1996). The ‘‘sandwich’’ system has been developed in Switzerland as a new method of living mulch combined with modified tillage. Annual or perennial crops are sown in a narrow strip (40 to 50 cm wide) within the tree row, whereas the soil to each side of this strip is tilled (Weibel et al., 2007). Weed control around the tree trunks can be avoided by having a low-growing vegetated strip and the narrow cultivated strip at each side of the tree row can provide a competition-free zone for tree roots (Schmid and Weibel, 2000; Weibel and Häseli, 2003). This method is reported to show the lowest costs for practical weed control without any negative effect on tree performance and yield (Stefanelli et al., 2009). The sandwich system can also decrease pests and diseases and increase biodiversity (Schmid and Weibel, 2000), improve soil conditions, and enhance nutrient cycling (Stork and Jerie, 2003; Yao et al., 2005). However, several challenges to sandwich systems must be resolved such as choosing living mulch mixtures that have minimal competition, avoiding rodent problems, and adjusting vegetation growth without any negative effects on apple yield, fruit quality, and storability. The aims of the present study were to investigate different OFMS in an organic apple orchard adapted to a cool climate and evaluate their effects on weed management, soil nutrient content, and soil physical conditions as well as apple yield, quality, and storability to replace standard tillage with new floor management systems. Materials and Methods Site description and experimental design. The study was conducted in an apple (Malus domestica var. Amorosa) orchard located in Kivik, southeastern Scania, Sweden (lat. 55 40#57$ N, long. 14 13#18$ E).

Each replicate consisted of 10 trees, but only the central six trees were used for measurements. The orchard was drip-irrigated, which was generally restricted to prevent leaching based on tensiometer monitoring with an iMetos (iMETOS ag; operation manual; Pessl Instruments GmbH Weiz, Austria; July 2005). The apple trees were grafted onto dwarf rootstock (M9) planted in Spring 1998 (with 4 m between rows and 1.5 m within rows) and trained to a super spindle form. Pruning was performed each year in early April to maintain this shape. The orchard was fertilized each year with an organic fertilizer (Bina Blue, Garta, Sweden) providing 25 g nitrogen (N), 4 g phosphorus (P), and 60 g potassium (K) per tree in May and 7, 1.1, and 16 g per tree, respectively, in June. Pest control was performed according to official regulations for commercial organic apple production imposed by the Swedish Board of Agriculture (Jordbruksverket, 2014). Orchard floor management systems. Five floor management systems were selected and established in an organic apple orchard in Mar. 2008: 1. Mechanical cultivation (M): A 1.5-m wide strip of the tree row was tilled three times per season (May, June, and September) using a rotary cultivator (Tournesol, Pellenc, France). The tractor speed for mechanical cultivation was 5 km·h and the tillage disturbed only the upper 8 cm of the soil. 2. Vinegar (V): Acetic acid (12%) was sprayed directly on the weeds at the threeto five-leaf stage in a 0.4-m wide strip under the trees on three occasions per season (June, July, and September) using an orchard weed sprayer (Hardi, Denmark) applying 3060 L·ha at a driving speed of 3.5 km·h. On each side of this sprayed strip, two strips of soil (40 cm wide) were shallow-tilled by the rotary cultivator (upper 8 cm of the soil) using the same schedule as in treatment M. 3. Living mulch, vegetation cover crop (L): A mixture of permanent weak grasses comprising perennial ryegrass [Lolium perenne L. cv. Greenway S (20%) and cv. Greenfair S (30%)], meadow grass [Poa pratensis L. cv. Conni S (45%)], and white clover [Trifolium repens L. cv. Pirouette’’ (5%)] was established in the tree row (150 cm wide) in May 2008 with a seed rate of 4 kg/100 m and was mown at 6-cm height three times per season using a Perfect Solo-Swing mower (Van Wamel B.V., The Netherlands). The clippings were mulched into the tree row. The vegetative cover (living mulch and weeds) in this plot was not cut during the rest of the year. 4. Sandwich system during the growing season (SSS): The same plant mixture as in treatment L was established in a band (40 cm wide) underneath the tree canopy, with the same seed rate, each year in April and mown three times per season. The clippings were mulched into the tree row. On each side of this area, two strips of soil (40 cm wide) were shallow-tilled by Pellenc (in the upper 8 cm of the soil) using the same schedule as in treatment M.

Among the countries in sub-Saharan Africa, Tanzania has an abundance of natural resources and major agricultural potential. However, one of the most important constraints facing Tanzania’s agricultural sector is the dependence on unreliable and irregular weather, including rainfall. A strategy to cope with climate uncertainty in semi-arid regions is to proceed with the sowing of the crop before the onset of the rainy season. The advantage is that when the rains start, seeds are already in the soil and can begin immediately the process of germination. The objective of this paper was to assess the effectiveness of dry-soil planting for maize as an adaptation strategy in the context of a changing climate in Dodoma, a semi-arid region in Tanzania. For this assessment, the DSSAT crop model was used in combination with climate scenarios based on representative concentration pathways. A probability of crop failure of more than 80% can be expected when sowing occurs during the planting window (of 21 days) starting on 1st November. The next planting window we assessed, starting on 23rd November (which was still before the onset of rain), presented significantly lower probabilities of crop failure, indicating that sowing before the onset of the rainy season is a suitable adaptation strategy. Results also indicated that, despite not reaching the highest maize grain yields, fields prepared for dry-soil planting still produced adequate yields. The cultivation of several fields using the dry planting method is a strategy farmers can use to cope with low rainfall conditions, since it increases the chances of harvesting at least some of the cultivated fields. We conclude that dry-soil planting is a feasible and valid technique, even in scenarios of climate change, in order to provide acceptable maize yields in semi-arid Tanzania.",https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s12571-017-0742-7.pdf,

This paper aims to evaluate the impacts of land use change and climate change on flooding in the Segamat River Basin, Johor, Malaysia, with 1D–2D hydrodynamic river modeling, using InfoWorks Integrated Catchment Modeling (ICM). The study involved the development of flood maps for four different scenarios: (1) future land use in 2030; (2) the impacts of climate change; (3) three mitigation strategies comprising detention ponds, rainwater harvesting systems (RWHSs), and permeable pavers; and (4) a combination of these three mitigation strategies. The obtained results show increases in the flood peaks under both the land use change and climate change scenarios. With the anticipated increase in development activities within the vicinity up to 2030, the overall impact of urbanization on the extent of flooding would be rather moderate, as the upper and middle parts of the basin would still be dominated by forests and agricultural activities (approximately 81.13%). In contrast, the potential flood-inundated area is expected to increase from 12.25% to 16.64% under storms of 10-, 50-, 100-, and 1000-year average recurrence intervals (ARI). Interestingly, the simulation results suggest that only the detention pond mitigation strategy has a considerable impact on reducing floods, while the other two mitigation strategies have less flood reduction advantages for this agricultural-based rural basin located in a tropical region.",https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/13/6/3286/pdf,

The quantification of the implications of LTR for water consumption, biomass accumulation and yield formation requires the use of dynamic crop modelling to simulate physiological and environmental processes and interactions in target environments. Here, a new transpiration module was developed for the Agricultural Production Systems sIMulator (APSIM NextGen) and used to simulate atmospheric and edaphic water stress on wheat crops. This module was parameterised with (i) data from a lysimeter experiment assessing genotypic variability in the LTR trait for four genotypes contrasting in transpiration efficiency, and with (ii) a more pronounced response to high evaporative demand. The potential of the LTR trait for improving crop productivity was investigated across the Australian wheatbelt over 1989-2018. The LTR trait was simulated to allow an increase in national yield by up to 2.6%, mostly due to shift in water use pattern, alleviation of water deficit during grain filling period and a higher harvest index. Greatest productivity gains were found in the northeast (4.9%, on average) where heavy soils allow the conserved water with the LTR trait to be available later at more critical stages. The effect of the LTR trait on yield was enhanced under the future climate scenario, particularly in the northeast. Limiting transpiration at high evaporative demands appears to be a promising trait for selection by breeders, especially in drought-prone environments where crops heavily rely on stored soil moisture.",https://academic.oup.com/insilicoplants/article-pdf/3/1/diab006/36395122/diab006.pdf,

In Northern Europe, the most common storage rot, Bull’s eye rot, is caused by Neofabraea spp., bitter rot by Colletotrichum spp., brown rot by Monilinia fructigena, grey mould is caused by Botrytis cinerea and Fusarium rot by several Fusarium species. Blue mold decay caused by Penicillium expansum is an important disease in several European countries. Incidence of different causal agents may vary depending on cultivar, climate during growing season and agricultural practices. The main objective of the study was to obtain baseline information about apple rot-causing fungi, their incidence during fruit storage and to evaluate the fungicide sensitivity of most of isolated fungal species. The study was performed during the storage period of apples after the growth season of 2013. Rotten apples were sorted in the storage and part of them was brought to the laboratory in order to obtain fungal isolates. Fungi were identified according to the morphological characteristics and sequencing of the ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 region. During storage in February and March the total percentage of rotten apples in various cultivars varied from 3.6 to 58.9%. All post-harvest diseases described in Northern Europe were detected. In part of the storehouses apple rot caused by Cadophora luteo-olivacea was observed. Alternaria spp. and Cladosporium spp. were detected on few apples as secondary infection agents. Using the most often isolated fungal species, sensitivity tests were performed against five commonly used fungicides. In general, the sensitivity of tested fungi to the fungicides was high with exception of several Neofabraea and Alternaria isolates.",https://sciendo.com/pdf/10.1515/plua-2015-0007,

The retained nutrient amounts by coffee plants changes according to the location, time of year, age, organs and the tissues within the same plant (Bragança et al., 2007) and maturation cycle (Partelli et al., 2014). The coffee’s fruiting process comprises a sequence of physiological events and morphological changes ranging from fl ower induction to fruit maturation, having a high demand for mineral nutrients (Carelli et al. 2006; Bragança et al, 2007; Melo et al. 2011; Partelli et al., 2014). During development, fruits are strong sinks for minerals and carbohydrates, therefore competing with other plant organs and often leading to nutritional defi ciencies in those organs of the same coffee plant (Reindeer and Maestri, 1985; Carvalho et al., 1993; Laviola et al., 2008). Physically adequate soil for coffee production can display low availability of some nutrients due to either actual defi ciency or factors which limit the absorption, frequently leading to defi ciency symptoms in coffee crops (Martinez et al., 2003; Partelli et al., 2006; Laviola et al., 2007a). An alternative to acceptable nutrition of crops is the use of organic nutrient sources, such as coffee husk (Serrano et al., 2011). Additionally, it has low cost, especially when the produced coffee is locally processed. The need for renewable options, available in-situ and lower cost for the supply of nutrients for the crop is increasingly important due to the need for more sustainable agriculture (Chemura, 2014). By knowing the amounts of allocated nutrients in Conilon coffee tissues, valuable information can be gathered to assist the planning of the coffee crop fertilization program, as well as its use as a complement to conventional fertilization. Therefore, this study aims at to quantify the concentration and accumulation of nutrients in the husk, beans and fruits from irrigated and non-irrigated Conilon coffee trees. MATERIALS AND METHODS Plant material and experimental conditions The experiment was performed in southern Bahia, Brazil (42’13 “S latitude and 39 ° 25’28’’W longitude) at an altitude of 108 m. Five year old plants from C. canephora cv. EMCAPA 8111 genotypes Clone 02 (Bragança et al., 2001) grown under fi eld conditions and spaced 3.5 x 1.0 m. According to Köppen classifi cation, the climate is Aw, tropical with a dry and rainy season during the winter and summer, respectively (Köppen, 1931; Alvares et al., 2014). The soil is classifi ed as Oxisol (sandy loam dystrophic Yellow Latosol) according to Embrapa (2013). Chemical and physical characteristics of the soil, at 0-20 cm layer were: P: 28.5 mg dm-3; K: 105 mg dm-3; Ca: 4.15 cmolc dm -3; Mg: 1.55 cmolc dm -3; S: 15.5 mg dm-3; B: 1.49 mg dm-3; Cu: 1.9 mg dm-3; Fe: 450 mg dm-3; Mn: 20.0 mg dm-3; Zn: 4.2 mg dm-3; pH: 6.25; H+ + Al3+: 2.85 cmolc dm -3; organic matter: 4.55 dag kg-1; total sand: 730 g kg-1; silt: 110 g kg-1; clay: 160 g kg-1; fi eld capacity: 0.19 cm3 cm-3 and permanent wilting point: 0.13 cm3 cm-3. A completely randomized design with two treatments (irrigated and non-irrigated) with 28 replicates under fi eld conditions were used. The management practices on the crop consisted in weeds control through herbicides and clipping, preventive phytosanitary management, liming, fertilization and irrigation (only on irrigated treatment). To implement the non-irrigated treatment, irrigation of the respective plot was suspended in March of 2011 in order to allow the plants acclimation to drought. In the irrigated treatment, surface drip irrigation was used with one line of emitters per plants lines, spaced every 0.5 m and fl ow of 2.0 L h-1. The air temperatures (maximum, mean and minimum), global solar radiation, rainfall and relative humidity of the air were collected at an automatic weather station located at a distance of 800 m from the experimental area (Fig. 1). The meteorological data were used to determine the reference evapotranspiration (ETo) according to the Penman-Monteith model (Allen et al., 1998). The irrigation management was adopted through water balance, based on crop evapotranspiration (ETc), rainfall measured at the site and water storage characteristics of soil. A daily soil water balance (for both irrigated and non-irrigated conditions) was calculated to identify water defi cit periods (Fig. 1). Both irrigated and non-irrigated treatments were fertilized annually with: N 500 kg ha-1; P2O5 100 kg ha -1; K2O 400 kg ha -1. The fertilizer was split and applied weekly on irrigated plants, through fertigation, whereas the fertilizer was split 10 times over the two years on nonirrigated plants. The coffee crop was conducted according to programmed cycle pruning system with four orthotropic branches (Verdin Filho et al., 2014). Nutrient accumulation measurements The fruit samples were collected during the harvest of 2012 and 2013 (two harvests), being collected 14 samples per treatment (one per plant) in each harvest. During the harvest, 50 coffee fruits were collected in each plant, being selected only mature fruits (consisting of two beans). Harvested fruits were dried in an oven with forced air at 70 oC for 72 h. Thereafter, the fruits were processed aiming at to separate the beans and husk. Afterward, these fruit parts were weighed on a precision balance to obtain the Covre, et al.: Nutrient in bean and fruit from Coffea canephora 404 Emir. J.

Thereafter, the samples (straw, bean and fruit) were fi nely ground in a wiley mill and used to macro (N, P, K, Ca, Mg and S) and micronutrients (Fe, Zn, Cu, Mn and B) analysis following the methodology described by Silva et al. (2009). The amount of husk and bean dry mass in a processed bag of 60 kg of coffee was estimated, considering the relationship found between bean and straw from fruit. Accumulation of macro and micronutrients in the husk and beans were calculated by dry mass x the concentration of each nutrient. Macro and micronutrients accumulated in the fruits were obtained from the sum of the macro and micronutrients contained in the husk and bean. All data were submitted to a one-way ANOVA, followed by a mean using the Student’s t–test, using Genes software (Cruz, 2013). A 95% confi dence level was adopted for all tests. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION The maintenance of an adequate mineral nutrition and of the balance between the several minerals is crucial to plant development. Such preservation of adequate mineral contents and balance within the plant is determinant for the expression of stress tolerance mechanisms on coffee (Ramalho et al., 2013), and assume a particular importance under predicted future conditions of climate changes and global warming (Martins et al., 2014), which are expected Fig 1.

J. Food Agric ● Vol 28 ● Issue 6 ● 2016 405 to simultaneously alter temperature and water availability to main crops, including to coffee (Rodrigues et al., 2016). The concentration and accumulation of nutrients in Conilon coffee showed no statistical differences between water treatments in husk, beans and the whole fruit (Table 1). Fruit dry mass production of Conilon coffee is not mainly infl uenced by the drought (non-irrigated plants) at the end of fruits physiological maturity stage (Table 1). The production of one ton (1000 kg) processed Conilon coffee resulted in production of 520.7 and 536.7 kg of husks by irrigated and non-irrigated plants, respectively (Table 1). Therefore, for each produced bag, the husk biomass represented ca. half of processed bean biomass, representing ca. 35% and. 65% of total fruit biomass, respectively, what agrees with Matiello et al. (2010) who claim that 2 kg Conilon coffee beans yields 1.3 kg of processed coffee. To the high yield of genotype 02 found here it would have contributed that only with perfect coffee fruit were used, that is, from fl owers which undergone complete syngamy with fertilization of the two ovules of fl ower. Additionally, the genotype 02 shows low proportion of “moca” beans (Pereira, 2015). These values are somewhat higher than those found for C. arabica genotypes that showed values in the range of ca. 43% to 59% of coffee beans yields to processed coffee (Gaspari-Pezzopane et al., 2005; Matiello et al., 2010; Palva et al., 2010). As regards the mineral contents in the fruit tissues, the macronutrient concentration of husk and beans showed no statistical difference between the irrigated and non-irrigated treatments, except for P concentration in the husk where non-irrigated plants presented a 33.3% higher value than irrigated plants (Table 2). This contrasted with the impact of extreme temperatures in mineral contents at leaf level (Ramalho et al., 2013; Martins et al., 2014), and might be linked to the strong sink effect of the fruits that could withdraw minerals from other plant organs, together with the mineral availability provided by the applied fertilization in the present experiments.

This study involves the assessment of spatial distribution of seasonal and annual ET using Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL) and provides an estimation of future changes in ET due to land use and climate change for a portion of the Narmada river basin in Central India. Climate change effects on future ET are assessed using the ACCESS1-0 model of CMIP5. A Markov Chain model estimated future land use based on the probability of changes in the past. The ET analysis is carried out for the years 2009–2011. The results indicate variation in the seasonal ET with the changed land use. High ET is observed over forest areas and crop lands, but ET decreases over crop lands after harvest. The overall annual ET is high over water bodies and forest areas. ET is high in the premonsoon season over the water bodies and decreases in the winter. Future ET in the 2020s, 2030s, 2040s, and 2050s is shown with respect to land use and climate changes that project a gradual decrease due to the constant removal of the forest areas. The lowest ET is projected in 2050.

Local food production as a substitute to imports would be an adaptive response, but enhancement of food security via food localization requires reflection on previous failings of conventional agricultural strategies so that informed decisions can be made. In light of potential reintroduction of local food production in remote First Nations communities, we investigated the cultural, social and ecological effects of a 20th century, Euro-Canadian agrarian settlement on the food system of a subarctic First Nation; this will act as the first step in developing a more sustainable local food program and enhancing food security in this community. METHODS To investigate the socio-cultural impacts of the Euro-Canadian agrarian initiative on the food system of Fort Albany First Nation, purposive, semi-directive interviews were conducted with elders and other knowledgeable community members. Interview data were placed into themes using inductive analyses. To determine the biophysical impact of the agrarian initiative, soil samples were taken from one site within the cultivated area and from one site in an undisturbed forest area. Soil properties associated with agricultural use and productivity were assessed. To compare the means of a given soil property between the sites, one-tailed t-tests were employed. Vegetative analysis was conducted in both sites to assess disturbance. RESULTS According to the interviewees, prior to the agrarian initiative, First Nation families harvested wild game and fish, and gathered berries as well as other forms of vegetation for sustenance. With the introduction of the residential school and agrarian initiative, traditional food practices were deemed inadequate, families were forced to work and live in the settlement (becoming less reliant on traditional foods), and yet little knowledge sharing of agricultural practices occurred. When the residential school and agrarian movement came to an end in the 1970s, First Nation community members were left to become reliant on an import food system. The mission's agrarian techniques resulted in overall degradation of soil quality and ecological integrity: compared the natural boreal forest, the cultivated area had been colonized by invasive species and had significantly lower soil levels of nitrogen, magnesium and organic carbon, and significantly higher levels of phosphorus and bulk density. CONCLUSIONS Because the agrarian initiative was not a viable long-term approach to food security in Fort Albany, the people became more reliant on imported goods. Taking into account climate change, there exists an opportunity whereby fruits and vegetables, historically stunted-in-growth or outside the distributional range of subarctic Canada, could now grow in the north. Together, agroecosystem stewardship practices and community-based, autonomous food security programs have the potential to increase locally grown food availability in a sustainable manner.",https://doi.org/10.22605/rrh2211,

To answer this, drastic depletion of fossil fuels and the challenges ahead on needs for the specific requirements are the major causes for the need alternative power. At the beginning of February, 2007, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) presented a report concluding that global concentrations of carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide have increased markedly as a result of human activities since 1750. The report states that the increase in carbon dioxide, the most important greenhouse gas, is primarily due to fossil fuel use. The report further indicates that the increased concentrations of carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide have increased the average global temperature, a phenomenon known as “global warming”. Eventually, if the temperature continues to increase, this will influence our everyday lives, since it changes the conditions of, for example, agriculture and fishing. In order to preserve the surplus energy coming out from the Sun, an alternative technique is necessary for our future energy needs. The potential of using the sun as a primary energy source is enormous. For example, sunlight strikes the Earth in one hour (4.3 × 1020 J) is sufficient to satisfy the more than the globel energy consumed on the planet in a year (4.1 × 1020 J). In other words, it has been calculated that covering 0.1% of the earth’s surface area with solar cells of 10% efficiency, corresponding to 1% of desert areas or 20% of the area of buildings and roads, would provide for global electricity consumption. As for as to convert the solar power into the basic electricity, there may be the new technology to be implimented to harvest the solar energy in an effective manner. In this regard, one way to consume solar power, the photovoltaic cell will be suitable one to convert sunlight into electrical energy. The challenge in converting sunlight into electricity via photovoltaic solar cells is dramatically reducing the cost/watt of delivered solar electricity, by approximately a factor of 5–10 times to compete with fossil and nuclear electricity and by a factor of 25–50 to compete with primary fossil energy. Recently, many of research groups are actively involving to harvest maximum conversion of solar power into electricity. Hence, varieties of new materials that are capable to absorb solar spectrum are successfully prepared in different methods. These new materials should satisfy the following important points to be act as the effective light harvesting materials. It should be efficiently absorb sunlight, should cover the full spectrum of wavelengths in solar radiation, and new approaches based on nanostructured architectures can revolutionize the technology used to produce energy from the solar radiation.

Thus, sustainable enhancements of agricultural production are needed. The present study investigated the effects of drought and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi on wheat plants (Triticum aestivum) and their interaction with aphids. Considering predicted climate change scenarios, wheat plants were exposed to well‐watered conditions, continuous drought (CD), or pulsed (PD) drought and plants were grown without (NM) or with mycorrhizal (AM) fungi. Ear biomass and harvest index were evaluated when grains were produced. Moreover, drought‐ and mycorrhiza‐induced changes in the amino acid composition of leaf phloem exudates were studied and the population growth and survival of Sitobion avenae aphids on those plants measured. Wheat plants responded differently toward the irrigation treatments. Under drought stress, ear biomass was reduced, while AM resulted in an enhanced harvest index. In phloem exudates especially, relative concentrations of the osmoprotectant proline were modulated by drought. Aphid population size was influenced by the interaction of drought and mycorrhiza treatment. This study emphasizes the pronounced influence of irrigation frequency on plant performance and indicates positive contributions of AM that may be relevant for agriculture.",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1002/ece3.6703,

Karst aquifers with high water flow velocities are extremely vulnerable to this problem. To cope with this situation, a field trial with an installation of ceramic suction cups under a randomised block design with a typical north-German cropping sequence of silage maize–winter wheat–winter barley was established in a karst water protection zone. Over three years, reduced nitrogen (N) application rates and N type (mineral or combined organic + mineral fertilisation) were tested for their effects on crop yields and leachate water quality below the root zone. Results showed no significant reductions in crop yields with 10/20% reduced N rates for cereals/maize and only slight reductions in cereal protein content. Nitrate concentration from adapted N rates was significantly lower in treatments with an application of organic fertilisers (−7.74 mg NO3-N l−1) with greatest potential after cultivation of maize; in only mineral fertilised plots the effect was smaller (−3.80 mg NO3-N l−1). Cumulative leaching losses were positively correlated with post-harvest soil mineral nitrogen content but even in unfertilised control plots losses >50 kg N ha−1 were observed in some crop-years.

Different RWHT have been tested in term of runoff retention, infiltration increase into the root zone, and soil water stress mitigation. To achieve these purposes, hydrological processes at the field scale have been investigated using a two-dimensional distributed hydrological model. To make the study representative of the whole Sahelian areas, several simulations were carried out adopting a wide range of input parameters based on conventional values of those areas. The results reveal that RWHT may lead to a runoff retention up to 87% and to double the infiltration. Intercepting and storing runoff, RWHT increase the water content in the root zone and the right design can diminish the crop water stress. Furthermore, the results show that adopting RWHT makes it possible to extend the growing season up to 20 days, enhancing the yield.

Production risks reduction is closely related with a better use of water resources and a better understanding of the effects resulting from the multiple interactions between climate, agricultural vegetation, soil type, and crops management techniques. In this paper, a remote and automatic agricultural monitoring system is presented as an effective alternative to the most traditional in situ measurements and observations. We investigated the use of phenological information extracted from satellite imagery combined with crop calendar and supported by agro-ecological zoning (AEZ) in accurate crop classification and monitoring. Vegetation indices extracted from Landsat 8 imagery are capable to track the vegetation development through the year, then phenological profiles can be extracted and implemented into a multitemporal automatic classification process to detect agricultural areas and to discriminate among different crop species. The phenological profiles extracted by satellite imagery are compared with crop calendar data compiled by FAO for the area of interest. The classification procedure is supported by AEZs based on crop modeling and environmental matching procedures in order to identify crop-specific environmental limitations under assumed levels of inputs and management conditions. The FAO crop water productivity model AquaCrop is calibrated for wheat and maize yield mapping in the central highland of Kenya, handling both environmental and phenological data.

Population growth and unprogrammed industrialization accelerate the consumption of available water resources. However, drought, as a result of climate change, poses a threat to water resources. Factors such as the exhaustibility of water resources, rapid population growth, unscheduled industrialization and drought increase the tendency towards alternative water resources. Rainwater harvesting is based on the principle of using the rainwater falling into the regions after it is stored. Water collected through rain harvesting can be utilized in many different areas, such as agricultural irrigation, landscape irrigation and domestic use. Among agricultural activities, the idea of water harvesting in greenhouse areas comes to the fore. Due to the gutters on the greenhouse roofs, water can be stored. In Antalya, which has about half of the greenhouses in Turkey, the amount of water in the rain harvest that can be obtained in greenhouses is 224,992,795.8 m3 per year. Monthly calculations throughout the year showed that the minimum water can be harvested in August (938,447.53 m3) and the maximum (54,771,210 m3) in December.

REDD+ payment was estimated as the net present value (NPV) of agricultural rent and forest rent during land clearing, minus net returns from sustainable wood harvest, divided by the corresponding reduction in carbon stock. The median compensation required to protect the current carbon stock in the two vegetation types ranged from USD 1 tCO2e−1 for the montane forest to USD 39 tCO2e−1 for the degraded miombo woodlands, of which up to 70 % and 16 %, respectively, were for compensating OCs from forest rent during land clearing. The figures were significantly higher when the cost of farmers’ own labor was not taken into account in NPV calculations. The results also highlighted that incentives in the form of sustainable harvests could offset up to 55 % of the total median OC to protect the montane forest and up to 45 % to protect the miombo woodlands, depending on the wage rates.

Short-season grain legumes have great potential to address this challenge and help to design more resilient and productive farming systems. However, grain legumes display a great diversity and differ widely in growth, development, and resource use efficiency. Three contrasting short season grain legumes common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.), cowpea (Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp.] and lablab [Lablab purpureus (L.) Sweet] were selected to assess their agricultural potential with respect to climate variability and change along the Machakos-Makueni transect in semi-arid Eastern Kenya. This was undertaken using measured data [a water response trial conducted during 2012/13 and 2013/14 in Machakos, Kenya] and simulated data using the Agricultural Production System sIMulator (APSIM). The APSIM crop model was calibrated and validated to simulate growth and development of short-season grain legumes in semi-arid environments. Water use efficiency (WUE) was used as indicator to quantify the production potential. The major traits of adaptation include early flowering and pod and seed set before the onset of terminal drought. Early phenology together with adapted canopy architecture allowed more optimal water use and greater partitioning of dry matter into seed (higher harvest index). While common bean followed a comparatively conservative strategy of minimizing water loss through crop transpiration, the very short development time and compact growth habit limited grain yield to rarely exceed 1,000 kg ha−1. An advantage of this strategy was relatively stable yields independent of in-crop rainfall or season length across the Machakos-Makueni transect. The growth habit of cowpea in contrast minimized water loss through soil evaporation with rapid ground cover and dry matter production, reaching very high grain yields at high potential sites (3,000 kg ha−1) but being highly susceptible to in-season drought. Lablab seemed to be best adapted to dry environments. Its canopy architecture appeared to be best in compromising between the investment in biomass as a prerequisite to accumulate grain yield by minimizing water loss through soil evaporation and crop transpiration. This lead to grain yields of up to 2,000 kg ha−1 at high potential sites and >1,000 kg ha−1 at low potential sites. The variance of observed and simulated WUE was high and no clear dependency on total rainfall alone was observed for all three short-season grain legumes, highlighting that pattern of water use is also important in determining final WUEbiomass and WUEgrain. Mean WUEgrain was lowest for cowpea (1.5–3.5 kggrain ha−1 mm−1) and highest for lablab (5–7 kggrain ha−1 mm−1) reflecting the high susceptibility to drought of cowpea and the good adaptation to dry environments of lablab. Results highlight that, based on specific morphological, phonological, and physiological characteristics, the three short-season grain legumes follow different strategies to cope with climate variability. The climate-smart site-specific utilization of the three legumes offers promising options to design more resilient and productive farming systems in semi-arid Eastern Kenya.",https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpls.2017.00699/pdf,

In a companion report, we presented the global meteorological forcing input used to drive the model and two natural hydrological cycle modules, namely, the land surface hy5 drology module and the river routing module. Here, we present the remaining four modules, which represent anthropogenic activities: a crop growth module, a reservoir operation module, an environmental flow requirement module, and an anthropogenic withdrawal module. In addition, we discuss the results of a global water resources assessment using the integrated model. The crop growth module is a relatively simple 10 model based on heat unit theory and potential biomass and harvest index concepts. The performance of the crop growth module was examined extensively because agricultural water comprises approximately 70% of total water withdrawal in the world. The estimated crop calendar showed good agreement with earlier reports for wheat, maize, and rice in major countries of production. The estimated irrigation water withdrawal also 15 showed fair agreement with country statistics, but tended to underestimate countries in the Asian monsoon region. In the reservoir operation module, 452 major reservoirs with more than 1 km each of storage capacity store and release water according to their own rules of operation. Operating rules were determined for each reservoir using an algorithm that used currently available global data such as reservoir storage capac20 ity, intended purposes, simulated inflow, and water demand in the lower reaches. The environmental flow requirement module was newly developed based on case studies from around the world. The integrated model closes both energy and water balances on land surfaces. Global water resources were assessed on a subannual basis using a newly devised index that locates water-stressed regions that were undetected in ear25 lier studies.

In order to quantify the climatic impact of fen soils in dairy farming systems of northern Germany, GHG exchange and forage yield were determined on four experimental sites which differed in terms of management and drainage intensity: (a) rewetted and unutilized grassland (UG), (b) intensive and wet grassland (GW), (c) intensive and moist grassland (GM) and (d) arable forage cropping (AR). Net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of CO2 and fluxes of CH4 and N2O were measured using closed manual chambers. CH4 fluxes were significantly affected by groundwater level (GWL) and soil temperature, whereas N2O fluxes showed a significant relation to the amount of nitrate in top soil. Annual balances of all three gases, as well as the global warming potential (GWP), were significantly correlated to mean annual GWL. A 2-year mean GWP, combined from CO2–C eq. of NEE, CH4 and N2O emissions, as well as C input (slurry) and C output (harvest), was 3.8, 11.7, 17.7 and 17.3 Mg CO2–C eq. ha−1 a−1 for sites UG, GW, GM and AR, respectively (standard error (SE) 2.8, 1.2, 1.8, 2.6).

Thirteen biomass-related and morphophysiological traits were extracted from RGB images acquired at 33 time points covering developmental stages from leaf count 5 at the first imaging date to leaf count 10–13 at the final harvest.

To date, the technology has only been purposefully tested in small-scale demonstration projects. This study aims to develop a concrete way to carry out WHS at large-scale. Results We describe a method of constructing a wood storage facility, named Wood Vault, that can bury woody biomass on a mega-tonne scale in specially engineered enclosures to ensure anaerobic environments, thus preventing wood decay. The buried wood enters a quasi-geological reservoir that is expected to stay intact semi-permanently. Storing wood in many environments is possible, leading to seven versions of Wood Vault: (1) Burial Mound (Tumulus or Barrow), (2) Underground (Pit, Quarry, or Mine), (3) Super Vault, (4) Shelter, (5) AquaOpen or AquaVault with wood submerged under water, (6) DesertOpen or DesertVault in dry regions, (7) FreezeVault in cold regions such as Antarctica. Smaller sizes are also possible, named Baby Vault. A prototype Wood Vault Unit (WVU) occupies 1 hectare (ha, 100 m by 100 m) of surface land, 20 m tall, stores up to 100,000 m 3 of wood, sequestering 0.1 MtCO 2 . A 1 MtCO 2 y −1 sequestration rate can be achieved by collecting currently unused wood residuals (WR) on an area of 25,000 km 2 , the size of 10 typical counties in the eastern US, corresponding to an average transportation distance of less than 100 km. After 30 years of operation, such a Wood Vault facility would have sequestered 30 MtCO 2 , stored in 300 WVUs, occupying a land surface of 300 ha. The cost is estimated at $10–50/tCO 2 with a mid-point price of $30/tCO 2 . To sequester 1 GtCO 2 y −1 , wood can be sourced from currently unexploited wood residuals on an area of 9 Mkm 2 forested land (9 million square kilometers, size of the US), corresponding to a low areal harvesting intensity of 1.1 tCO 2 ha −1 y −1 . Alternatively, giga-tonne scale carbon removal can be achieved by harvesting wood at a medium harvesting intensity of 4 tCO 2 ha −1 y −1 on 3 Mkm 2 of forest (equivalent to increasing current world wood harvest rate by 25%), or harvest on 0.8 Mkm 2 forest restored from past Amazon deforestation at high harvest intensity, or many combinations of these and other possibilities. It takes 1000 facilities as discussed above to store 1 GtCO 2 y −1 , compared to more than 6000 landfills currently in operation in the US. After full closure of a Wood Vault, the land can be utilized for recreation, agriculture, solar farm, or agrivoltaics. A more distributed small operator model (Baby Vault) has somewhat different operation and economic constraints. A 10 giga-tonne sequestration rate siphons off only 5% of total terrestrial net primary production, thus possible with WHS, but extreme caution needs to be taken to ensure sustainable wood sourcing. Conclusions Our technical and economic analysis shows that Wood Vault can be a powerful tool to sequester carbon reliably, using a variety of wood sources. Most pieces of the technology already exist, but they need to be put together efficiently in practice. Some uncertainties need to be addressed, including how durability of buried wood depends on detailed storage methods and burial environment, but the science and technology are known well enough to believe the practicality of the method. The high durability, verifiability and low-cost makes it already an attractive option in the current global carbon market. Woody biomass stored in Wood Vaults is not only a carbon sink to combat current climate crisis, but also a valuable resource for the future that can be used as biomass/bioenergy and carbon supply. The quantity of this wood utilization can be controlled carefully to maintain a desired amount of CO 2 in the atmosphere to keep the Earth’s climate from diving into the next ice age, acting as a climate thermostat. The CO 2 drawdown time is on the order of 100 years while the ramp-up time is a decade. A sense of urgency is warranted because the CO 2 removal rate is limited by biosphere productivity, thus delayed action means a loss of opportunity. In conclusion, WHS provides a tool for managing our Earth system, which will likely remain forever in the Anthropocene.",https://cbmjournal.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s13021-022-00202-0,

The UK government boasted that these nations had made a landmark pledge to end deforestation (2). Yet, one crucial detail was left out: whether that deforestation will be gross or net. The distinction matters, because differing interpretations of how countries can “end deforestation” significantly impact future carbon dioxide emissions. Put simply, ending gross deforestation would be a major step forward for the climate. But considering only net deforestation could be anecdotal and even be detrimental to biodiversity. Overall, human activities related to land use emit 4 gigatonnes (Gt) of carbon dioxide (CO2) per year to the atmosphere (3). These are net emissions, comprising both carbon losses and carbon gains. On the loss side, the destruction of tree biomass during deforestation, for large-scale agriculture, cattle ranching, or shifting cultivation (cycles of cutting forest for agriculture, then abandoning to recover soil fertility, then returning), and the legacy emissions from harvested wood products, form the bulk of gross emissions, totaling 14 Gt CO2 per year (3).

We determined photosynthetic and transpiration responses to photosynthetic photon flux (PPF), carbon dioxide concentrations, and temperature, and parameterized a coupled leaf gas-exchange model for hardneck garlic (Allium sativum). The parameterized model performed with high accuracy and precision in predicting photosynthetic responses [r = 0.95, bias = 1.7 mmol m s, root mean square error (RMSE) = 2.4 mmol m s] when tested against independent data that were not used for model calibration. The model performance for transpiration rates was less satisfactory (r = 0.49, bias = –0.14 mmol m s, RMSE = 0.94 mmol m s). In addition, we characterized the relationships among chlorophyll meter readings, leaf photosynthetic capacity (Amax), and leaf nitrogen content in garlic leaves. The chlorophyll meter readings were a reasonable indicator of both Amax (r 2 = 0.61) and leaf nitrogen (N) status (r = 0.51) for garlic leaves we studied. The garlic leaf gas-exchange model developed in this study can serve as a key component in ecophysiological crop models for garlic. Similarly, the quantitative relationship identified between chlorophyll meter readings and Amax in this study can provide useful information for non-destructively assessing leaf photosynthetic capacity in garlic. With a long history of cultivation, garlic is an important food crop that has been incorporated into cuisines around the world. As of 2010, the crop was cultivated on 1.3 million hectares worldwide with total production reaching more than 22 million megagrams (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, 2010). In addition, garlic has been used medicinally for millennia (Rivlin, 2001) as a health supplement (Stevinson et al., 2000) and at times a panacea (Kik et al., 2001). There exists a rich literature detailing garlic botany and horticulture (Engeland, 1994; Kamenetsky, 2007), especially regarding nutrient (Bertoni et al., 1992; Buwalda, 1986b) and water inputs (Villalobos et al., 2004). Previous studies have made valuable contributions in modeling canopy responses using radiation use efficiency and water use efficiency in garlic (Rizzalli et al., 2002; Villalobos et al., 2004). Building on these efforts, a mechanistic crop simulation model that integrates the current knowledge of physiology and ecology of this important crop will improve our ability to enhance garlic yield and quality for health benefits, optimize crop management decisions, and develop adaptation strategies to reduce climate change impacts and vulnerability. Crop models are essential tools for assessing climate impacts on crops, assisting crop breeding and management decisions, forecasting crop yield for policy and economic decisions, and developing adaptive cropping solutions in a changing climate as recently illustrated by Chen et al. (2011). Because leaves are a fundamental unit for carbon uptake and water use, a leaf physiology module is a critical component that, when built into a full crop simulation model, can be scaled to the canopy level. Leaf physiology models simulating photosynthesis and transpiration are at the core of process-based crop models for accurate predictions of crop biomass accumulation, allocation, and yield formation (Kim and Lieth, 2003; Lizaso et al., 2005). Coupled leaf gas-exchange models of photosynthesis and transpiration are a useful modeling approach in that they mechanistically interface carbon, water, and energy balances governing physical, biochemical, and physiological processes involved in leaf gas exchange (Kim and Lieth, 2003). These models have become essential tools for assessing climate impacts on forest and other ecosystems (e.g., Thornton et al., 2002) and for studying biosphere–atmosphere interactions (Krinner et al., 2005). However, most crop simulation models have yet to adopt the coupled model approach with a few exceptions (e.g., Da Silva et al., 2011; Kim et al., 2012). To build a leaf physiology model, it is critical to characterize photosynthetic responses to a wide range of key environmental factors including PPF, CO2, and temperature. However, limited information is available on garlic leaf physiology in the literature. Garlic has moderate to high N demand with an estimate of 80 to 170 kg ha in California (Rosen and Tong, 2001) or 120 kg ha in New Zealand as an optimal level (Buwalda, 1986a). A nondestructive optical method using a chlorophyll meter (e.g., SPAD 502; Konica Minolta, Ramsey, NJ) is useful in determining crop nutrient status (e.g., N) without destructively harvesting plants. For example, chlorophyll meters have been widely used for assessing plant N status in various agronomic and horticultural crops such as corn [Zea mays (Yang et al., 2012)], rice [Oryza sativa (Peng et al., 1999)], apple [Malus pumila (Neilsen et al., 1995)], and potato [Solanum tuberosum (Uddling et al., 2007)]. In many crops, chlorophyll meter readings are closely related to leaf N status but this relationship Received for publication 6 Nov. 2012. Accepted for publication 21 Dec. 2012.

Chlorophyll meter readings may be used as a surrogate for leaf photosynthetic capacity if these readings can reflect leaf senescence and nutritional status that determine the functioning of photosynthetic apparatus. A method that links chlorophyll meter readings with leaf photosynthetic capacity may provide a practical yet mechanistic method to determine crop photosynthesis as a surrogate of production potential. In this study, we characterized photosynthetic and transpiration responses of garlic leaves and applied the results to parameterize a coupled leaf gas-exchange model developed by Kim and Lieth (2003). This model was developed for cut-flower rose (Rosa ·hybrida), but has been extended to and adopted for other crop models such as potato (Fleisher et al., 2010), peach [Prunus persica (Da Silva et al., 2011)], rose (Buck-Sorlin et al., 2011), cucumber [Cucumis sativus (Wiechers et al., 2011)], and Scaevola aemula (Kim et al., 2007). Specifically, the aims of our study were to 1) evaluate photosynthetic responses of garlic leaves to light, temperature, and CO2; 2) parameterize a coupled gas-exchange model for garlic leaves; and 3) test the model performance against an independent data set not used for parameterization. We also tested if and how chlorophyll meter readings are related to photosynthetic capacity and leaf N content during senescence in garlic leaves. This study fills a gap in our knowledge of garlic ecophysiology that is fundamental for developing a mechanistic, processbased crop model. Materials and Methods PLANT MATERIALS.

The main challenge to be faced by the agriculture sector in coming years is to feed the rapidly growing population while maintaining the key resources such as soil fertility, efficient land use, and water. Climate change is also a critical factor that impacts agricultural production. Among others, a major effect of climate change is the potential alterations in the growth cycle of crops which would likely lead to a decline in the agricultural output. Due to the increasing demand for proper agricultural management, this study explores the effects of meteorological variation on wheat yield in Chakwal and Faisalabad districts of Punjab, Pakistan and used normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) as a predictor for yield estimates. For NDVI data (2001-14), the NDVI product of Moderate Resolution Imaging spectrometer (MODIS) 16-day composites data has been used. The crop area mapping has been realised by classifying the satellite data into different land use/land covers using iterative self-organising (ISO) data clustering. The land cover for the wheat crop was mapped using a crop calendar. The relation of crop yield with NDVI and the impact of meteorological parameters on wheat growth and its yield has been analysed at various development stages. A strong correlation of rainfall and temperature was found with NDVI data, which determined NDVI as a strong predictor of yield estimation. The wheat yield estimates were obtained by linearly regressing the reported crop yield against the time series of MODIS NDVI profiles. The wheat NDVI profiles have shown a parabolic pattern across the growing season, therefore parabolic least square fit (LSF) has been applied prior to linear regression. The coefficients of determination ( R 2 ) between the reported and estimated yield was found to be 0.88 and 0.73, respectively, for Chakwal and Faisalabad. This indicates that the method is capable of providing yield estimates with competitive accuracies prior to crop harvest, which can significantly aid the policy guidance and contributes to better and timely decisions.",https://www.agronomy.it/index.php/agro/article/download/897/891,

Increasingly volatile weather and more extreme events such as droughts can reduce crop productivity. This implies the need for significant increases in production and the adoption of more efficient and sustainable production methods and adaptation to climate change. A new technological and environment-friendly management technique to improve the tolerance of quinoa grown to maturity is proposed using native microbial biostimulants (arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi; AMF) alone, in the consortium, or in combination with compost (Comp) as an organic matter source under two water treatments (normal irrigation and drought stress (DS)). Compared with controls, growth, grain yield, and all physiological traits under DS were significantly decreased while hydrogen peroxide, malondialdehyde, and antioxidative enzymatic functions were significantly increased. Under DS, biofertilizer application reverted physiological activities to normal levels and potentially strengthened quinoa’s adaptability to water shortage as compared to untreated plants. The dual combination yielded a 97% improvement in grain dry weight. Moreover, the effectiveness of microbial and compost biostimulants as a biological tool improves grain quality and limits soil degradation under DS. Elemental concentrations, particularly macronutrients, antioxidant potential (1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl radical scavenging activity), and bioactive compounds (phenol and flavonoid content), were accumulated at higher levels in biofertilizer-treated quinoa grain than in untreated controls. The effects of AMF + Comp on post-harvest soil fertility traits were the most positive, with significant increases in total phosphorus (47%) and organic matter (200%) content under drought conditions. Taken together, our data demonstrate that drought stress strongly influences the physiological traits, yield, and quality of quinoa. Microbial and compost biostimulation could be an effective alternative to ensure greater recovery capability, thereby maintaining relatively high levels of grain production. Our study shows that aboveground stress responses in quinoa can be modulated by signals from the microbial/compost-treated root. Further, quinoa grains are generally of higher nutritive quality when amended and inoculated with AMF as compared to non-inoculated and compost-free plants.",https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpls.2022.860484/pdf,

Using the case of 12 farmer-managed irrigation systems (FMIS) in Central and Western Nepal, this paper explores the institutional coping and adaptation mechanisms to water stress. We find that local irrigation institutions manage water stress using diverse and integrated approaches broadly categorized as structural and operational measures. Structural measures include water-source expansion and infrastructure rehabilitation works whereas water re-allocation and drought continency rules are examples of operational measures. We find that integration of structural and operational measures is more prevalent in highly water-stressed irrigation systems than in less stressed ones. The choice of adaptation strategies has direct implications for agricultural productivity. FMIS that implemented structural measures harvested more crops per year than those systems that adopted only operational strategies or no adaptation strategies. However, the marginal benefit of adopting adaptation measures is particularly pronounced in water-stressed systems. Climate variability and change act as a threat multiplier because they compound the existing threats the FMIS face from social and economic changes. The key to effective integration of structural and operational measures that help FMIS to maintain their productivity during water stress are collective action and governance to overcome biophysical limitations.",http://www.thecommonsjournal.org/articles/10.5334/ijc.901/galley/997/download/,

SM and τ are retrieved from ASCAT using both a seasonal (mean climatological) and a dynamic vegetation characterization that allows for year-to-year changes.

We found that a stronger vegetation correction within the SM retrieval improves the SM product considerably (increase of the Spearman correlation coefficient r s by 0.15 on average, and r s comparable to SMAP and AMSR2). The vegetation product derived with a dynamic vegetation characterization compares well to the reference datasets and reflects vegetation dynamics such as start and peak of season and harvest.

Mallee-based agroforestry has potential to provide farmers with new income sources derived from biofuels, biofeedstocks, and carbon sequestration. Although mallees are planted on >12 700 ha across the south-west of Western Australia, very little commercial harvesting of mallee has occurred to date. The development of biomass processing industries is constrained by lack of robust information regarding the productivity of integrated mallee and agricultural systems. This study addresses this constraint by quantifying the productivity and economics of agricultural crops and pastures growing in the competition zone adjacent to mallee belts at 15 sites across the Western Australian wheatbelt. The sites covered a range of climate and edaphic conditions, three mallee species (Eucalyptus polybractea R Baker, E. loxophleba ssp. lissophloia LAS Johnson and KD Hill, or E. kochii ssp. plenissima (CA Gardner) Brooker), various crop and pasture rotations, and various mallee harvest-management treatments. Mallee–crop competition was negatively correlated with rainfall and positively correlated with mallee age and size, and greater for crops than pasture. Consequently, extent and magnitude of competition were highly variable across sites and years. On average, mallee–crop competition extended 11.3 m from unharvested belts and reduced crop and pasture yields by 36% within 2–20 m of the mallee belts relative to open paddock yields. This is similar to what has been reported for taller tree species. Harvesting mallees reduced competition such that crop and pasture yield was reduced by 22 or 27% relative to open paddock yields for mallees harvested at 3- or 6+-year intervals, respectively. The economic cost of mallee–crop competition on agricultural enterprises was also highly variable between sites, and between years within individual sites. Averaged across all site-years, the opportunity cost of competition was equivalent to forgoing agricultural production for 14.4 m on each side of unharvested mallee belts, or 9–10 m on each side of harvested belts. Farmers with mallee agroforestry systems will need to manage the economic impacts of competition by reducing agricultural input costs in the competition zone, timing crop-grazing rotations with mallee harvests, ensuring that the width of alleys is at least 25 times the height of the mature trees, and possibly root-pruning mallees in unharvested or long harvest interval systems. This research has shown that mallee–crop competition presents a significant cost to farmers and must be considered when designing mallee agroforestry systems. The findings have relevance for the development of appropriate biomass and carbon sequestration pricing benchmarks for mallee plantings.",https://www.publish.csiro.au/cp/pdf/CP12129,

Although the impacts of climate change on crop yield and the environment have received much attention in recent years, there are few studies on its implications for the production of high-quality seeds that provide the basic input for food production. Seeds are the primary planting material for crop cultivation and carry most new agricultural technologies to the field. Climatic abnormalities occurring at harvest and during the post-harvest stages may not always severely impact seed yield but can reduce the morphological, physiological and biochemical quality, ultimately reducing the field performance and planting value of the seed lot. In our preliminary data mining that considered the first 30 species appearing in the search results, seed setting, seed yield and seed quality parameters under temperature, CO2 and drought stresses showed differential response patterns depending on the cotyledon number (monocots vs. dicots), breeding system (self- vs. cross-pollinated), life cycle (annual vs. perennial) and maturity time (seed setting in cooler vs. hotter months). The relative proportions of the 30 species showed that germination and seedling vigour are adversely affected more in dicots and self-pollinated annual species that set seeds in hotter months. Together, these impacts can potentially reduce the quantity and quality of seeds produced. Immediate attention and action are required to understand and mitigate the detrimental impacts of climate change on the production and supply of high-quality seeds. This review summarises the current knowledge on this aspect, predicts the future implications and suggests some potential mitigation strategies in the context of projected population growth, climate change and seed requirement at the global level.",https://doi.org/10.15258/sst.2023.51.1.07,

Agricultural systems that rely on monsoon rainfall are especially vulnerable to changes in climate variability. This paper uses machine learning to deepen understanding of how monsoon variability impacts agricultural productivity. We demonstrate that random forest modelling is effective in representing rice production variability in response to monsoon weather variability. Our random forest modelling found monsoon weather predictors explain similar levels of detrended anomaly variation in both rice yield (33%) and area harvested (35%). The role of weather in explaining harvested rice area highlights that production area changes are an important pathway through which weather extremes impact agricultural productivity, which may exacerbate losses that occur through changes in per-area yields. We find that downwelling shortwave radiation flux is the most important weather variable in explaining variation in yield anomalies, with proportion of area under irrigation being the most important predictor overall. Machine learning modelling is capable of representing crop-climate variability in monsoonal agriculture and reveals additional information compared to traditional parametric models. For example, non-linear yield and area responses of irrigation, monsoon onset and season length all match biophysical expectations. Overall, we find that random forest modelling can reveal complex non-linearities and interactions between climate and rice production variability.",https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-27752-8.pdf,

The spatial regression and the instrumental variable method with the generalized method of moment were employed to address the endogeneity problems with the unique climate dataset. The current article investigated that total rainfall and the La Niña event determined harvested area of cassava. In addition, the harvested area was decreased as the population density increased due to high demand for non-agricultural use. On the other hand, increased access to irrigation systems enhanced the harvested area of cassava. Considering the yield of cassava, we found an inverted U-shape relationship between yield and temperature. Moreover, this study revealed that climate variability, extreme events and technological progress statistically influenced cassava yields. By using the climate projections during 2046–2055, we found that harvested area and yield of cassava were projected to reduce 12.49–16.05% and 2.57–6.22% from the baseline. As a result, cassava production in Thailand was predicted to decline 14.74–21.26% from the baseline.

It revealed both the increasing frequency of extreme events and structural shortcomings with respect to access to healthy diets, equitable livelihoods, resilience, and climate and environmental sustainability challenges that pervade AFS worldwide (Barrett et al 2020). Return to prior state is both unlikely and undesirable. The central question is howwill AFSs transform in response to the pandemic and the conditions it revealed? The pandemic has shifted awareness and incentives in ways that have the capacity—but are not guaranteed—to prompt necessary, transformational AFS adaptation (Kates et al 2012, Bassett and Fogelman 2013). Will AFS transformation occur and, if so, who will benefit and who will bear the costs and risks? Drawing on a year-long global expert panel review (Barrett et al 2020) we summarize the evidence on AFS impacts of the pandemic and offer seven key lessons to guide adjustments to policies and practices. Massive AFS disruptions have been commonplace throughout history. Crop failures and livestock disease epidemics have caused agricultural supply shocks, natural disasters and conflict have disrupted local or regional supply chains, and price spikes driven by rapid demand growth—including in related markets, like for petroleum products— or speculative market behavior have been commonplace, even within the past two decades (Barrett 2013, Baldos and Hertel 2015, Lesk et al 2016, Davis et al 2021, Gomez et al 2021). The COVID-19-driven AFS shock is unusual because it originates primarily from a massive collapse and restructuring of food demand, one disproportionately impacting the food service sub-sector (e.g. restaurants, school cafeterias), coupled with shocks to labor availability at multiple agri-food value chain (AVC) entry points (figure 1). There was no major shock to primary production on farm, no infrastructure destruction, and no price spike. Primary agricultural production proved remarkably robust in 2020 despite modest-to-moderate supply-side disruptions in some countries, mainly due to labor supply and transport disruptions caused by government-imposed movement restrictions meant to slow disease transmission. The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) reports record global cereals harvests for 2020 (FAO 2021b). And despite food export bans imposed by at least 21 different national governments—mostly lasting only a few weeks—and massive shutdown of commercial passenger transportation, merchandise freight shipments proved remarkably resilient, especially in multinational firms’ global supply chains (Laborde et al 2020). The major AFS disruptions originated chiefly from the demand-side shock of workplace closures that affected 93% of the world’s workers as of early January 2021, resulting in historically unprecedented losses equivalent to 255 million full-time jobs, with disproportionately adverse impacts on the food service sector globally (ILO 2021). The combination of disease outbreaks and movement restrictions led to labor shortages at all nodes throughout the value chain (Aday and Aday 2020, Gruère and Brooks 2021). Survey data from >30 000 households in nine lowand middle-income countries (LMICs) reveal 68% reported income losses from the pandemic (Egger et al 2021). Income loss combined with a 22.5% increase in the FAO global food price index from the May 2020 low to January 2021—as supply growth was outpaced by demand growth, especially in China and for feedgrains such as maize (FAO 2021b)—together caused 45% of LMIC households to miss or reduce meals (Egger et al 2021). Even in high-income countries (HICs), demand for private and public food assistance rose as millions more people struggled to feed their families. Before the pandemic, more than three billion people worldwide could not afford a healthy diet (Bai et al 2020, FAO et al 2021); the UN estimates that in 2020 the number of people lacking access to adequate food increased by 320 million and the global prevalence of undernourishment increased by 1.5 percentage points (FAO 2021a).

The conservation agriculture based on tillage intensity, crop residue retention and raising green manuring (GM) crops during the intervening period between wheat harvest and rice establishment offers opportunities for restoration of phosphorus (P) dynamics and stimulate phosphatase activities within the macro-and micro-aggregates. Phosphorus and phosphatase activities in the soil aggregates affected by different residue management practices remain poorly understood. Thus, soil samples were obtained after a five-year field experiment to identify the effect of tillage, green manure and residue management on aggregate-associated phosphorus fractions. Four main plot treatments in rice included combination of wheat straw and GM were conventional till puddled transplanted rice (PTR) with no wheat straw (PTRW0), PTR with 25% wheat stubbles retained (PTRW25), PTR without wheat straw and GM (PTRW0 + GM), and PTR with wheat stubbles and GM (PTRW25 + GM).

Results of the present study revealed significantly higher phosphorus fractions (HCl-P, NaHCO3-Pi and NaOH-Po) in treatment PTRW25 + GM and ZTWR100 compared with PTRW0/CTWR0 within both macro- and micro-aggregates.

At this point, postharvest handling is becoming more important, which is the main determinant of the postharvest losses.

Under a high-emission scenario, large reductions in yields are expected by the end of this century for both rainfed and irrigated management systems of maize (42%, 31.4%), rice (51.4%, 41.3%), sorghum (41.1%, 36.6%), soybean (59.1%, 44.9%), wheat (23.3%, 20.0%), and rainfed sugarcane (11.7%).

Although the effects of such events on the production of major crops is well-documented, the response of a larger pool of crops is unknown and the potential of crop diversity to buffer agricultural outputs against weather extremes remains untested. Here, we evaluate whether increasing the diversity of crop portfolios at the country level confers greater resistance to a country’s overall yield and revenues against losses to droughts and high temperatures. To do this, we use 58 years of annual data on weather, crop yields and agricultural revenues for 109 crops in 127 countries. We use the spatial distribution of each crop and their cropping cycle to determine their exposure to weather events. We find that growing greater crop diversity within countries reduces the negative impacts of droughts and high temperatures on agricultural outputs. For drought, our results suggest that the effect is explained not only by crop diversity itself, but also by the sensitivity of the most abundant crops (in terms of harvested areas) to this extreme. Countries dedicating more land to minor, drought-tolerant crops reduce the average sensitivity of country-scale crop portfolios and show greater resistance of yield and revenues to drought. Our study highlights the unexploited potential for putting crop biodiversity to work for greater resilience to weather, specifically in poorer developing countries that are likely to suffer disproportionately from climate change impacts.",https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/acc2d6/pdf,

In the present study, we analyse the association between agricultural land-use, predator abundance and winter severity on the number of European brown hares harvested in Denmark in the years 1955 through 2000.ResultsWinter cereals had a significant negative association with European brown hare numbers. In contrast to this, root crop area was positively related to their numbers. Remaining crop categories were not significantly associated with the European brown hare numbers, though grass out of rotation tended to be positively related. The areas of root crop production and of grass out of rotation have been reduced by approximately 80% and 50%, respectively, while the area of winter cereals has increased markedly (>70%). However, European brown hare numbers were primarily negatively associated with the number of red fox. Finally, we also found a positive association between mild winters and European brown hare numbers.ConclusionThe decline of Danish European brown hare populations can mainly be attributed to predation by red fox, but the development in agricultural land-use during the last 45 years have also affected the European brown hare numbers negatively.

Restoring such degraded soils through organic matter amendments and diversified crop rotations is thus an intrinsic part of organic farming. This review discusses a wide range of organic farming impacts on soil health and crop productivity by focusing on organic fertilizers and crop diversification. Conventional fertilizers were considered vital for agricultural production to harvest high crop yields. Nevertheless, they are now deemed as environmentally hazardous and an obstacle to sustainable agroecosystems due to intensive chemical inputs that damage the soil over time and have long-lasting impacts. Conventional fertilization results in nutrient depletion, loss of microbial diversity, organic matter reduction, and deterioration of physical characteristics of the soil. Conversely, organic fertilization makes use of naturally existing resources to improve soil health. Organic amendments such as biochar, manure, and fermented grass improve soil’s physical, chemical, and biological properties and promote the growth and diversity of beneficial soil microorganisms—important in nutrient cycling and soil stability. They facilitate the uptake of nutrients, hinder crop pathogen growth, mitigate heavy metals, and decompose xenobiotic organic substances. Moreover, growing cover crops is also a major strategy to improve soil health. Diversified crop rotation with combinatorial use of organic fertilizers may improve soil health and agricultural yields without any detrimental impacts on the environment and soil, ensuring sustainable food production, safety, and security. This integrated approach contributes to minimizing the use of chemical fertilizers and their effects on environmental health. It also contributes to reducing agricultural inputs along with enhancing OM, soil microbial diversity and biomass, nitrogen fixation, and carbon sequestration. Therefore, cover crops and organic fertilization may offer sustainable agroecosystems and climate change mitigation.",https://doi.org/10.3390/agronomy14122871,

To identify cultivars best suited for extended-season production in northwest Washington, nine leafy green cultivars were grown at two locations in the spring and fall seasons for 2 years. A high level of variability in crop performance was observed between seasons, locations, years, planting dates, and cultivars, indicating low-yield stability in baby-leaf salad crops across diverse environments and conditions. Overall, cultivars had a higher marketable weight in the spring than in the fall. Marketable weight was higher in Spring 2013 than in Spring 2014, and was higher in Fall 2013 than in Fall 2012. Days to harvest (DTH) were shorter in the spring than in the fall both years, and in both seasons DTH varied by’1 week between the two trial locations. Fresh weed biomass was almost 5.5 times higher in spring than in fall both years. Overall, pak choi ‘Joi Choi’ and mustard ‘Komatsuna’ had the highest marketable weight, lowest DTH, and lowest weed biomass across the widest range of environments and conditions, while beet ‘Bull’s Blood’ had the lowest marketable weight, relatively long DTH and highest weed biomass. These results suggest that baby-leaf salad crop cultivar selection differs for spring and fall seasons, and production can be highly variable between years and locations. Further, results suggest that growers should plant a diversity of crop cultivars each season to protect from crop loss and to achieve overall yield stability. Ready-to-eat salad mix has experienced more than a 5-fold increase in supermarket sales over the last 20 years in the United States, increasing from $197 million in 1993 to $2.7 billion in 2008, while the sales of iceberg and romaine head lettuce have decreased (Cook, 2008). Bagged ready-to-eat salad mixes were first widely distributed in supermarkets in 1989, and were composed of mature heads of lettuce (Lactuca sativa; primarily iceberg type) cut into bite-sized pieces using specialized head lettuceprocessing equipment (Thompson andWilson, 1999). Today, a diverse array of leafy green salad crops are grown for baby-leaf salad mix in the United States, including lettuce, spinach (Spinacea oleracea L.), mustard greens (Brassica juncea L. and Brassica oleracea L.), pak choi (Brassica rapa L.), kale (Brassica oleracea L.), arugula (Eruca sativa L. and Diplotaxis tenuifolia L.), and beet greens (Beta vulgaris L.) (Hardesty and Leff, 2009). Although the widespread consumption and distribution of baby-leaf salad mix is a relatively recent development in the United States, the practice of harvesting leafy greens at an immature stage of development originated with the concept of mesclun, or ‘‘spring mix’’ in Provence, France, in the 1700s andwas introduced to American cuisine in metropolitan restaurants in the late 1960s (Hardesty, 2010). Growers in California and Arizona are able to produce leafy green salad crops yearround because of the region’s mild winter climate (Koike et al., 2011; Reader, 2003; Smith et al., 2011). These two states accounted for 96% of all lettuce grown in the United States in 2012, and the Salinas Valley alone accounted for 70% of leafy green salad crops (City of Salinas EconomicDevelopment, 2013; USDA, 2010), which included 57,200 t of spring mix, 15,100 t of baby-leaf spinach, 11,800 t of radicchio (Cichorium intybus L.), 21,900 t of kale, and 945,000 t of leaf lettuce (Monterey County Crop Report, 2012). In most other states, leafy green salad crops are grown seasonally on smallandmoderate-sized farms, with over 70% of lettuce and over 60% of spinach producers growing less than one-half hectare (USDA, 2010, 2012b, 2014). In Washington State, lettuce was produced on 222 farms totaling 83 ha in 2012 with leaf lettuce as the dominant lettuce type, followed by crisphead and romaine types (USDA, 2012b). Spinachwas produced on 44 farms totaling 64 ha in 2012. There is strong demand in northwest Washington for locally grown baby-leaf salad greens. While the market is well supplied throughout the summer in this region because of the mild climate that is conducive to baby-leaf salad green production, growers require production information to enable them to extend the season as much as possible in the spring and fall. Research on salad crop production has historically focused on crop performance at the mature growth stage (Clarkson et al., 2003; Farnham and Garrett, 1996; Hoque et al., 2010; Sanchez and El-Hout, 1995; Zhao and Carey, 2009). Babyleaf salad greens are harvested between 30 and 45 d after planting, and in recent studies it has been shown that cultivar performance at the baby-leaf stage differs from performance at the mature stage because of physiological and morphological differences between the developmental stages (Borrelli et al., 2013; Coolong et al., 2013; Egea-Gilabert et al., 2013;Wallace et al., 2012). The objective of this experiment was to evaluate nine salad crop cultivars for suitability as baby-leaf salad greens in the spring (April–June) and six cultivars for the fall (September–November) growing seasons in northwest Washington. Overall productivity, earliness, and ability to compete with weeds were measured. Materials and Methods This study was conducted at two locations 65 km apart in northwest Washington: Cloud Mountain Farm Center (CMFC) in Everson, and Washington State University’s Northwestern Washington Research and Extension Center (WSU NWREC) in Mount Vernon. Soil at CMFC was Squalicum gravelly loam and at WSU NWREC was Skagit Received for publication 24 June 2015. Accepted for publication 5 Aug. 2015.

Weather data including air temperature, relative humidity, soil temperature, and light transmission (photosynthetically active radiation) were monitored at both field sites with aHOBOweather station (Onset Corporation, Bourne, MA). The CMFC location was managed organically as per U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) guidelines, and the WSU NWREC location was in transition to certified organic. At CMFC, a mixed small grain and pea cover crop was grown before the field study, and a pea cover crop was grown previously at WSU NWREC. At both locations the research design was a randomized complete split block with three replications. The main plot was planting date and the split plot treatment was cultivar. The study included two planting dates, 2 weeks apart, in the spring and fall seasons, and was repeated for 2 years. There were nine cultivars in the spring season, and six in the fall season; crop cultivars are provided in Table 2. Plots were one bed wide and 10 m long at both locations. At CMFC, beds were 0.75 m wide and 8 cm high, and at WSU NWREC, beds were 0.75 m wide and 18 cm high; at both locations bed spacing was 1.75 m center-to-center. At both locations, preplant organic fertilizer Wil-Gro Proganic 8-2-4 (Wilbur-Ellis Company, Yakima, WA) was broadcast applied at 56 kg·ha to bed centers before bed shaping. On each bed, cultivars were planted in six rows spaced 10 cm apart. Seed spacing within each rowwas 1 cm and planting rate was 80 seeds per meter-row to achieve a seeding density of 2.7 million seeds/ha. Irrigation was applied at a rate of 36 mm·d three times per week and was adjusted for precipitation. At CMFC, irrigation was applied using microsprinklers (Nelson Irrigation Corporation, Walla Walla, WA), and at NWREC, drip irrigation was applied using two tapes (8-inch emitter spacing, 2.5 L/min/30.5 m; T-Systems International, San Diego, CA) per bed spaced 20 cm apart equidistant from the center of the bed. Weeds were not managed within beds so that weed growth could be measured for each cultivar. Row cover (85% transmittance Agribon AG-19; Polymer Group Inc., Charlotte, NC) was applied to all Brassica crops (mustards ‘Yukina Savoy’, ‘Komatsuna’, and ‘Bekana’, kale ‘Winter Red’, arugula ‘Adagio’, and pak choi ‘Joi Choi’) for spring plantings at WSU NWREC in 2013 and 2014 after flea beetles were observed in those plots. Flea beetle damage at CMFC was negligible, thus rowcover was not used at this site. Rowcover was not applied during the fall at either location as no flea beetle damage was observed during that period. Data collection. Seedling emergence was measured twice weekly in each plot until no newly emerged plants were observed within that plot for a period of 1 week. The center 1 m of each plot was harvested when the majority of plants had leaves 10 cm long (the marketable size for baby-leaf salad). Leaves were cut by hand 3 cm above the soil surface. Although it is possible to harvest baby-leaf salad crops up to three times if the crop is left in the field to regrow, data were only collected for the initial harvest of each plot. Harvest date, weight (g) of marketable leaves, and the fresh weight (g) of weeds in the harvested area were recorded for each plot; however, weeds were not measured at CMFC in Fall 2012 due to an oversight. In this study, damage that rendered leaves unmarketable was primarily because of flea beetle feeding; an insect feeding hole larger than 0.5 cm in diameter classified the leaf as unmarketable per local market acceptability standards. Leaves that exhibited discoloration, decay, or disease symptoms as well as plants that had bolted were also co",https://journals.ashs.org/downloadpdf/journals/hortsci/50/10/article-p1467.pdf,

The investigation is conducted using numerical modeling via the system-level simulation tool Aladdin (developed and released freely by the Institute for Future Intelligence, IFI) for solar energy systems, wind energy systems, or the built environment. The Aladdin energy simulator is first evaluated here by comparison with published experimental and numerical results corresponding to the historical 50 kW prototype SUTPP that was successfully tested in Manzanares (Spain) between 1982 and 1989. This prototype has a height of about 195 m for the chimney (the updraft tower) and a radius of about 122 m for the solar heat absorber (the solar air collector or the greenhouse). Next, various climate and performance characteristics are investigated and contrasted for nine different locations around the world with a similar latitude of 24°, which is within the sunbelt, assuming that the same Manzanares SUTPP prototype geometry is employed in these locations. These nine locations are Muscat (Oman), Al Jawf (Libya), Riyadh (Saudi Arabia), Karachi (Pakistan), Ahmedabad (India), Havana (Cuba), Culiacán (Mexico), Dhaka (Bangladesh), and Baise (China). The energy generation intensity (EGI) for the Manzanares-type solar updraft tower power plant in these nine examined locations was between 0.93 kWh/m2 per year (in Baise) and 2.28 kWh/m2 per year (in Muscat). Also, Muscat had the smallest seasonality index (maximum-to-minimum monthly electric output) of 1.90, while Baise had the largest seasonality index of 4.48. It was found that the main limitation of the overall SUTPP energy conversion efficiency is the chimney efficiency (the process of accelerating the air after entering the chimney). This study concludes that solar updraft towers (SUTs) cannot compete with existing mature and modular renewable energy alternatives, particularly photovoltaic (PV) panels, if the aimed use is commercial utility-scale electricity generation. Instead, SUTs may become attractive and achievable if viewed as hybrid-use projects by serving primarily as a large-scale greenhouse area for agricultural applications while secondarily allowing energy harvesting by generating clean (emissions-free) electricity from the incoming solar radiation heat.",https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/17/2/405/pdf?version=1705137712,

The IDSS is comprised of a suite of models, namely the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), Agricultural Policy/Environmental eXtender (APEX), and Farm Income and Nutrition Simulator (FARMSIM). The IDSS was applied in Dimbasinia watershed in northern Ghana using irrigation water from shallow groundwater. The watershed has a modest amount of shallow groundwater resources. However, the average annual irrigation water requirement exceeded the average annual shallow groundwater recharge. It was found that the current crop yield in Dimbasinia watershed was only ~40% of the potential crop production. This is mainly related to climate variability, low soil fertility, and land-management practices. For example, application of 50 kg/ha urea and 50 kg/ha DAP doubled maize and sorghum yield from the current farmers’ practices. Better income was obtained when irrigated vegetables/fodder were cultivated in rotation with sorghum as compared to in rotation with maize. Investment in solar pumps paid better dividends and also supplied clean energy. The socio-economic analysis indicated that having irrigated dry season vegetables will improve household nutrition. Since shallow groundwater recharge alone may not provide sufficient water for irrigation in a sustainable manner, surface water may be stored using water-harvesting structures to supplement the groundwater for irrigation. Integrated use of the water resources will also reduce depletion of the shallow groundwater aquifer. We conclude that IDSS is a promising tool to study gaps and constraints as well as upscaling of SSI.",https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/10/5/1531/pdf?version=1526030273,

Identification of underutilised indigenous crops with useful food security traits may provide part of the solution. Enset (Ensete ventricosum) is a perennial banana relative with cultivation restricted to southwestern Ethiopia, where high productivity and harvest flexibility enables it to provide a starch staple for ∼20 million people. An extensive wild distribution suggests that a much larger region may be climatically suitable for cultivation. Here we use ensemble ecological niche modelling to predict the potential range for enset cultivation within southern and eastern Africa. We find contemporary bioclimatic suitability for a 12-fold range expansion, equating to 21.9% of crop land and 28.4% of the population in the region. Integration of crop wild relative diversity, which has broader climate tolerance, could enable a 19-fold expansion, particularly to dryer and warmer regions. Whilst climate change may cause a 37%–52% reduction in potential range by 2070, large centres of suitability remain in the Ethiopian Highlands, Lake Victoria region and the Drakensberg Range. We combine our bioclimatic assessment with socioeconomic data to identify priority areas with high population density, seasonal food deficits and predominantly small-scale subsistence agriculture, where integrating enset may be particularly feasible and deliver climate resilience. When incorporating the genetic potential of wild populations, enset cultivation might prove feasible for an additional 87.2–111.5 million people, 27.7–33 million of which are in Ethiopia outside of enset’s current cultivation range. Finally, we consider explanations why enset cultivation has not expanded historically, and ethical implications of expanding previously underutilised species.",https://doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/ac40b2,

The widespread use of nano-fertilizers (NFs) in agriculture endangers soil and plants. It is vital to research the behavior of nano-phosphors (nano-P) on plant growth and quality, as well as their technique of interaction with soil properties in order to obtain key ecosystem benefits. With this in mind, a field experiment was conducted using wheat as a test crop to explore the impact of nano phosphorus (nano-P) on soil. The study’s goal was to examine how the foliar application of nano-P to wheat affects its growth, yield and nutrient concentration. Treatments consisted of: T1: 100% NPK (120:137:72 kg N:P2O5:K2O ha−1) by RDF (recommended dose of fertilizer); T2: 100% NPK by RDF + 2 foliar sprays of nano-P @ 494.21 mL ha−1; T3: 100% NK + 0% P (no foliar); T4: 100% NK + 75% P + 2 foliar sprays of nano-P @ 494.21 mL ha−1; T5: 100% NK + 50% P + 2 foliar sprays of nano-P @ 494.21 mL ha−1;T6: 100% NK + 0% P + 2 foliar sprays of nano-P @ 494.21 mL ha−1; T7: 100% NPK by RDF + 1 foliar spray of nano-P @ 494.21 mL ha−1; T8: 100% NK + 75% P + 1 foliar spray of nano-P @ 494.21 mL ha−1; T9: 100% NPK + 1 foliar spray of nano-P @ 494.21 mL ha−1; T10-100% NK + 75% P + 1 foliar spray of nano-P @ 494.21 mL ha−1. According to the findings, applying 100% NK + 75% P + 2 foliar applications of nano-P at the tillering and panicle initiation stages increased yield over 100% RDF by 37.1%. Additionally, the highest micronutrient concentration (Zn (36.4 mg kg−1), Cu (21.2 mg kg−1), Mn (22.9 mg kg−1) and Fe (61.1 mg kg−1)) in grain were noticed in T3 (100% NK + 0% P no foliar spray of nano-P) treatment, which was superior to T1 (100% NPK). Furthermore, foliar application of nano-P fertilizer in combination with different levels of diammonium phosphate (DAP) slightly increased the amount of N, P and K, as well as micronutrients in post-harvest soil. In summary, the use of 100% NK + 75% + 2 foliar applications of nano-P saved 25% recommendation dose P if supplied as nano-P as a form of phosphorus, and can be a suitable substitute for DAP, especially in smart agriculture, as it possibly reduces P leaching into groundwater, while maintaining or increasing wheat crop yield over the 100% RDF.",https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4395/13/3/768/pdf?version=1678348886,

Machine learning methods can be used to predict crop yield based on a combination of remote sensing data and data collected by ground weather stations. This paper argues that forecasting drylands farming yield can be reliable for management purpose under uncertain conditions using machine learning methods and remote sensing data and determines which indicators are most important in predicting the yield of chickpea. In this study, the yield of rainfed chickpea farms in 11 top chickpea producing counties in Kermanshah province, Iran, was predicted using three machine learning methods, namely support vector regression (SVR), random forest (RF), and K-nearest neighbors (KNN). To improve prediction accuracy, for each county, remote sensing data were overlaid by the satellite images of rainfed farms with a suitable slope and altitude for rainfed farming. An integrated database was created by combining weather data, remote sensing data, and chickpea yield statistics. The methods were evaluated using the leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) technique and compared in terms of multiple measures. Given the sensitivity of rainfed chickpea yield to the time of data, the predictions were made in two scenarios: (1) using the averages of the data of all growing months, and (2) using the data of a combination of months. The results showed that RF provides more accurate yield predictions than other methods. The predictions of this method were 7–8% different from the statistics reported by the Statistical Center and the Ministry of Agriculture of Iran. It was found that for pre-harvest prediction of rainfed chickpea yield, using the data of the March–April period (the averages of two months) offers the best result in terms of the correlation coefficient for the relationship between the yield and the predictor indices.",https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/13/9/4607/pdf,

Integrated crop–livestock systems (ICLSs) have the potential to offset these greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, as recycling products within the farm boundaries is prioritized. Here, we quantify seasonal and annual greenhouse gas budgets of an ICLS dairy farm in Wisconsin USA using satellite remote sensing to estimate vegetation net primary productivity (NPP) and Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) guidelines to calculate farm emissions. Remotely sensed annual vegetation NPP correlated well with farm harvest NPP (R2 = 0.9). As a whole, the farm was a large carbon sink, owing to natural vegetation carbon sinks and harvest products staying within the farm boundaries. Dairy cows accounted for 80% of all emissions as their feed intake dominated farm feed supply. Manure emissions (15%) were low because manure spreading was frequent throughout the year. In combination with soil conservation practices, ICLS farming provides a sustainable means of producing nutritionally valuable food while contributing to sequestration of atmospheric CO2.

Climate-change assessments, meanwhile, often focus on the production node while neglecting other components of the value chain. In response to these shortcomings, the International Center for Tropical Agriculture (CIAT), in collaboration with the Government of Kenya, developed the climate risk profiles (CRP) approach. Using a case study from Nyandarua County in Kenya, we illustrate how this approach (i) supports identification of major climate risks and their impacts on the value chain, (ii) identifies adaptation interventions, and (iii) promotes the mainstreaming of climate-change considerations into development planning at the subnational level. Our results show that the magnitude of a climate risk varies across value chains. At the input and production stage, strategies for supporting climate-smart value chains include the following: improving access to input markets, supporting diversification and value addition, provision of climate-smart production technologies, dissemination of climate information services, and making financial and insurance services available. At the harvesting, processing and marketing stages, useful interventions would include strengthening farmer organization, investing in climate-proofed infrastructure including roads and facilities for storage, processing and improving access to output markets.

Thus, the critical review was aimed at highlighting the overview of biomass energy in South-East Asia as a dynamically developing region, in order to obtain economic and environmental benefits from the existing sources of biomass in the world. The current review analyzed the sources of biomass, as well as their energy potential, use, and management, based on reports from different countries, published studies, and scientific articles. In SAC, the main sources of biomass were found to be coconut residues, oil palm residues, sugar cane residues, rice straw, rice husks, wood waste, and firewood. The combined annual biomass potentials in the forestry and agricultural sectors in South-East Asia were approximately over 500 million tons per year and more than 8 gigajoule of total energy potentials.

Smart grid technologies have ways for solutions for better electric power production and efficient ways for distribution and transmission of electricity. Smart grids require less space and can be more easily installed when compared to traditional grids because of their versatilities. Upcoming challenges include technology optimization for the following uses of biomass energy: direct combustion of woody biomass; pyrolysis and gasification of biomass; anaerobic digestion of organic waste to produce biogas; landfill gas production direct incineration of organic waste.

The soils of the vineyards differentiated in structure, porosity and related hydropedological characteristics, as well as in salinity. Soil spatial variability was deeply affected by earth movement carried out before vine plantation. Six plots were selected in the different hydrological functional units of the two vineyards, that is, at summit, backslope and footslope morphological positions, to monitor soil hydrology, grape production and wine quality. Plot selection was based upon a cluster analysis of local slope, topographic wetness index (TWI), and cumulative moisture up to the root limiting layer, appreciated by means of a detailed combined geophysical survey. Water content, redox processes and temperature were monitored, as well as yield, phenological phases, and chemical analysis of grapes. The isotopic ratio δ13C was measured in the wine ethanol upon harvesting to evaluate the degree of stress suffered by vines. The grapes in each plot were collected for wine making in small barrels. The wines obtained were analysed and submitted to a blind organoleptic testing. The results demonstrated that the combined application of the two hydropedological models can be used for the prevision of the moisture status of soils cultivated with grape during summertime in Mediterranean climate. As correctly foreseen by the models, the amount of mean daily transpirable soil water (TSW) during the growing season differed considerably between the vineyards and increased significantly along the three positions on slope in both vineyards. The water accumulation along slope occurred in every year, even during the very dry 2006. The installation of indicators of reduction in soils (IRIS) tubes allowed confirmation of the occurrence of reductive processes in the most shallow soil. Both Sangiovese grape yield and quality of wine were influenced by the interaction between TSW content and salinity, sometimes contrary to expectations. Therefore, the studied hydropedological models were not relevant to predict grape yield and wine quality in all the hydrological functional units. The diffusion of hydropedological models in precision viticulture could be boosted considering salinity along with topography and soil hydrological characteristics.",https://hess.copernicus.org/articles/13/1635/2009/hess-13-1635-2009.pdf,

This study aims to quantify changes in the timing of garden strawberry blooms and harvests in the Baltic States using Regional Climate Models (RCMs). First, parameters for a strawberry phenology model based on the growing degree day (GDD) methodology were determined. Growing degree days were calculated using a modified sine wave method that estimates the diurnal temperature cycle from the daily maximum and minimum temperature. Model parameters include the base temperature and the required cumulative GDD sum, estimated from phenological and meteorological observations in Latvia for the years 2010-2013 via iterative calibration. Then an ensemble of bias-corrected RCM results (ENSEMBLES project) was used as input to the phenological model to estimate the timing of strawberry phenological processes for the years 1951-2099. The results clearly show that strawberry phenological processes can be expected to occur earlier in the future, with a significant change in regional patterns. Differences between coastal and inland regions are expected to decrease over time. The uncertainty of the results was estimated using the RCM ensemble spread, with northern coastal locations showing the largest spread.",https://doi.org/10.3176/earth.2016.04,

However, information on how the spatial distribution of specific crops has changed over time across the globe is relatively sparse. We introduce the Probabilistic Cropland Allocation Model (PCAM), a novel algorithm to estimate where specific crops have likely been grown over time. Specifically, PCAM downscales annual and national-scale data on the crop-specific area harvested of 17 major crops to a global 0.5-degree grid from 1961 to 2014. To do this, pixels are assigned into probability clusters based upon crop-specific pixel suitability (based on mean climate and soil characteristics) and gridded historical agricultural areas. PCAM maps compare relatively well with an existing gridded dataset of crop-specific areas circa 2000 (simple matching coefficient value >0.8 for all crops). PCAM estimates compare less well with time series county-level agricultural census data for the United States. Importantly, deviations between census data and PCAM benchmark estimates (driven by soil and climate suitability) can be used to infer the importance of other factors of agricultural production (e.g. labor, agricultural policy, extreme climate) in future work. Our results provide new insights into the likely changes in the spatial distribution of major crops over the past half-century.",https://doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/ab3b93,

In spite of the critical role it plays in food security, peri-urban agriculture has not received adequate attention with regards to its interface with climate change in Zimbabwe. Using a sample of thirty peri-urban plots selected through snowballing, this study investigated the farmers’ perceived effects of climate change on peri-urban agriculture in Bulawayo, and how farmers were adapting to climate change. The findings of the study revealed that peri-urban farmers perceived and observed significant climatic and related changes that were negatively impacting their farming activities. Observed changes included reduced precipitation levels, increased atmospheric temperature and diminishing borehole yields. Farmers were adapting with a variety of methods which included repeated planting, watering plants during the night, renting animal space in other farms with more water sources and purchasing supplementary feed for livestock. Among other issues, this study recommends the promotion of the use of drought tolerant seed varieties, improved water harvesting and a more rationalised system in managing livestock numbers in the plots.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/23311886.2021.1944486?needAccess=true,

Zn deficiency is a major micronutrient disorder in crop plants and humans worldwide, adversely impacting agricultural productivity, human health and socio-economic concern. Globally, the entire cycle of increasing the Zn concentration in wheat grains and its ultimate effect on grain yield, quality, human health & nutrition and socio-economic status of livelihood is less compared. So the present studies were planned to compare the worldwide studies for the alleviation of Zn malnutrition. Zn intake is affected by numerous factors from soil to crop, crop to food and food to humans. The post-harvest fortification, diversification in dietary habits, mineral supplementation and biofortification are various possible approaches to enhance the Zn concentration in food. The wheat grains Zn is influenced by the Zn application technique and time concerning crop developmental stages. The use of soil microorganisms mobilize unavailable Zn, and improve Zn assimilation, plant growth, yield and Zn content in wheat. Climate change can have an inverse impact on the efficiency of agronomic biofortification methods due to a reduction in grain-filling stages. Agronomic biofortification can improve Zn content, crop yield as well as quality and ultimately, have a positive impact on human nutrition, health and socioeconomic status of livelihood. Though bio-fortification research has progressed, some crucial areas are still needed to be addressed or improved to achieve the fundamental purpose of agronomic biofortification.",https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11157-023-09653-4.pdf,

South America is following the global trend toward urbanization and the problems that accompany it. Agricultural expansion led to an expanded market for pesticides that includes the deadly DDT, paraquat, and heptachlor. Brazil and Colombia are the largest consumers. Latin American officials justify use of DDT, which is banned in the US and many European countries, as an effective means of combating mosquitos that carry malaria. Exposure occurs during harvesting, transporting, forestry, livestock farming, and vector control activities. Methyl bromide, which is used post-harvest and as a soil fumigant, is dangerous enough to be banned in the US in 2001, and in developing countries in 2002. Exposure to toxic chemicals can severely inhibit enzyme action that is necessary for neurological functioning. A hot climate, which prevents protective clothing, lack of education on proper application, and absence of water to wash exposed skin, make pesticide protection very difficult. Over 40 million agricultural workers are at risk of pesticide poisoning. Habitat destruction has contributed to increased mosquito infestations. Children in the workplace are at even greater risk of noise pollution and chemical poisoning. South America pollutes almost 11 times more fresh water per capita than Europe. About 70% of domestic garbage is collected, and about 30% is disposed of correctly. Only 10% of urban wastewater is treated before discharge into waterways. The loss of coastal wetlands reduces the ability of waterways to filter and absorb nutrients. Environmental health problems suggest an interlinkage between environmental sustainability, human health, and economic growth.",https://doi.org/10.2307/3433694,

In order to investigate the effects of different cultivation technologies on growth and the water and fertilizer use efficiency of rapeseed (Brassica napus L.), a two-year field study was conducted in rainy (2016–2017) and drought (2017–2018) seasons which included three cultivation patterns: (1) conventional flat planting (FP); (2) straw mulching (SM); (3) ridge-furrow rainfall harvesting system (RF), and three fertilization patterns: (1) conventional fertilization (CF); (2) reduced slow-release fertilizer (SR); and (3) no fertilizer as a control treatment. The results indicated that the yield and its composition values were lower in the rainy year than in the seasonal dry year. The single water-saving technology had no significant effect on yield increase when seasonal drought occurred. The two technologies (SM + SR and RF + SR) improved the height, leaf SPAD value and dry matter of the rapeseed and adjusted the root–shoot ratio under two different climate conditions. In the rainy season, these technologies reduced the loss of nutrients, while in the seasonal drought year, it increased the soil moisture. The SM + SR and RF + SR increased the yield of rapeseed by 7.71% and 29.93% and enhanced oil content by 4.64% and 7.91%, respectively, compared with the local cultivation pattern. Meanwhile, these treatments decreased the total water consumption during whole growth stages and promoted water use efficiency by 14.84% and 28.71%, respectively. The combination of SM + SR and RF + SR also increased the accumulation of N, P, and K and significantly promoted the utilization efficiency of fertilizer. In the future, the adverse effects of environmental factors could be relieved, and the goal of cost savings and increasing efficiency could be achieved by adopting the optimal cultivation technologies in rapeseed production of Southwest China.",https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/12/2/703/pdf?version=1579607329,

With a rapidly changing climate and limited access to agricultural resources, many rural farmers in Zimbabwe have found it extremely difficult to engage in meaningful crop production activities and secure their livelihoods and incomes. This paper employs participatory research methods to examine adaptive strategies adopted by rural farmers. The strategies include optimal water resource utilisation, early maturing seed adoption, soil and water conservation (SWM), and nutrient management techniques (NMT). Cost-effective integration of labour and post-harvest storage facilities is also considered. Rural farmers, despite constraints, actively engage in these adaptive practices. The study assesses the effectiveness of initiatives to enhance crop production and build resilience against climate variability. Discussion centers on the comprehensiveness of these adaptive techniques within the broader framework of sustainable development goals, focusing on goals 1 (No Poverty) and 2 (Zero Hunger).
