Biomass burning plays a significant role in air pollution and climate change. In this study, we used a method based on fire radiative energy (FRE) to develop a biomass burning emission inventory for China from 2003 to 2017. Daily fire radiative power (FRP) data derived from 1 km MODIS Thermal Anomalies/Fire products (MOD14/MYD14) were used to calculate FRE and combusted biomass. Available emission factors were assigned to four biomass burning types: forest, cropland, grassland, and shrubland fires. The farming system and crop types in different temperate zones were taken into account in this research. Compared with traditional methods, the FRE method was found to provide a more reasonable estimate of emissions from small fires. The estimated average annual emission ranges, with a 90 % confidence interval, were 91.4 (72.7–108.8) Tg CO2 yr−1, 5.0 (2.3–7.8)  Tg CO yr−1, 0.24 (0.05–0.48) Tg CH4 yr−1, 1.43 (0.53–2.35) Tg NMHC yr−1, 0.23 (0.05–0.45) Tg NOx yr−1, 0.09 (0.02–0.17) Tg NH3 yr−1, 0.03 (0.01–0.05) Tg SO2 yr−1, 0.04 (0.01–0.08) Tg BC yr−1, 0.27 (0.07–0.49) Tg OC yr−1, 0.51 (0.19–0.84) Tg PM2.5 yr−1, 0.57 (0.15–1.05) Tg PM10 yr−1, where NMHC, BC, and OC are nonmethane hydrocarbons, black carbon, and organic carbon, respectively. Forest fires are determined to be the primary contributor to open fire emissions, accounting for 45 % of the total CO2 emissions (average 40.8 Tg yr−1). Crop residue burning ranked second place with a large portion of 39 % (average 35.3 Tg yr−1). During the study period, emissions from forest and grassland fires showed a significant downward trend. Crop residue emissions continued to rise during 2003–2015 but dropped by 42 % in 2015–2016. Emissions from shrubland were negligible and little changed. Forest and grassland fires are concentrated in northeastern China and southern China, especially in the dry season (from October to March of the following year). Plain areas with high crop yields, such as the North China Plain, experienced high agricultural fire emissions in harvest seasons. Most shrubland fires were located in Yunnan and Guangdong provinces. The resolution of our inventory (daily, 1 km) is much higher than previous inventories, such as GFED4s and GFASv1.0. It could be used in global and regional air quality modeling.","Abstract. Bottom-up scaling of net ecosystem production (NEP) and net biome production (NBP) was used to generate a carbon budget for a large heterogeneous region (the state of Oregon, 2.5×105 km2) in the western United States. Landsat resolution (30 m) remote sensing provided the basis for mapping land cover and disturbance history, thus allowing us to account for all major fire and logging events over the last 30 years. For NEP, a 23-year record (1980–2002) of distributed meteorology (1 km resolution) at the daily time step was used to drive a process-based carbon cycle model (Biome-BGC). For NBP, fire emissions were computed from remote sensing based estimates of area burned and our mapped biomass estimates. Our estimates for the contribution of logging and crop harvest removals to NBP were from the model simulations and were checked against public records of forest and crop harvesting. The predominately forested ecoregions within our study region had the highest NEP sinks, with ecoregion averages up to 197 gC m−2 yr−1. Agricultural ecoregions were also NEP sinks, reflecting the imbalance of NPP and decomposition of crop residues. For the period 1996–2000, mean NEP for the study area was 17.0 TgC yr−1, with strong interannual variation (SD of 10.6). The sum of forest harvest removals, crop removals, and direct fire emissions amounted to 63% of NEP, leaving a mean NBP of 6.1 TgC yr−1. Carbon sequestration was predominantly on public forestland, where the harvest rate has fallen dramatically in the recent years. Comparison of simulation results with estimates of carbon stocks, and changes in carbon stocks, based on forest inventory data showed generally good agreement. The carbon sequestered as NBP, plus accumulation of forest products in slow turnover pools, offset 51% of the annual emissions of fossil fuel CO2 for the state. State-level NBP dropped below zero in 2002 because of the combination of a dry climate year and a large (200 000 ha) fire. These results highlight the strong influence of land management and interannual variation in climate on the terrestrial carbon flux in the temperate zone.","Since the early 1980s, water management of rice paddies in China has changed substantially, with midseason drainage gradually replacing continuous flooding. This has provided an opportunity to estimate how a management alternative impacts greenhouse gas emissions at a large regional scale. We integrated a process‐based model, DNDC, with a GIS database of paddy area, soil properties, and management factors. We simulated soil carbon sequestration (or net CO2 emission) and CH4 and N2O emissions from China's rice paddies (30 million ha), based on 1990 climate and management conditions, with two water management scenarios: continuous flooding and midseason drainage. The results indicated that this change in water management has reduced aggregate CH4 emissions about 40%, or 5 Tg CH4 yr−1, roughly 5–10% of total global methane emissions from rice paddies. The mitigating effect of midseason drainage on CH4 flux was highly uneven across the country; the highest flux reductions (>200 kg CH4‐C ha−1 yr−1) were in Hainan, Sichuan, Hubei, and Guangdong provinces, with warmer weather and multiple‐cropping rice systems. The smallest flux reductions (<25 kg CH4‐C ha−1 yr−1) occurred in Tianjin, Hebei, Ningxia, Liaoning, and Gansu Provinces, with relatively cool weather and single cropping systems. Shifting water management from continuous flooding to midseason drainage increased N2O emissions from Chinese rice paddies by 0.15 Tg N yr−1 (∼50% increase). This offset a large fraction of the greenhouse gas radiative forcing benefit gained by the decrease in CH4 emissions. Midseason drainage‐induced N2O fluxes were high (>8.0 kg N/ha) in Jilin, Liaoning, Heilongjiang, and Xinjiang provinces, where the paddy soils contained relatively high organic matter. Shifting water management from continuous flooding to midseason drainage reduced total net CO2 emissions by 0.65 Tg CO2‐C yr−1, which made a relatively small contribution to the net climate impact due to the low radiative potential of CO2. The change in water management had very different effects on net greenhouse gas mitigation when implemented across climatic zones, soil types, or cropping systems. Maximum CH4 reductions and minimum N2O increases were obtained when the mid‐season draining was applied to rice paddies with warm weather, high soil clay content, and low soil organic matter content, for example, Sichuan, Hubei, Hunan, Guangdong, Guangxi, Anhui, and Jiangsu provinces, which have 60% of China's rice paddies and produce 65% of China's rice harvest.","Abstract. Sequestration of soil organic carbon (SOC) on cropland has been proposed as a climate change mitigation strategy to reduce global greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations in the atmosphere, which in particular is needed to achieve the targets proposed in the Paris Agreement to limit the increase in atmospheric temperature to well below 2 ∘C. We analyze the historical evolution and future development of cropland SOC using the global process-based biophysical model LPJmL, which was recently extended by a detailed representation of tillage practices and residue management (version 5.0-tillage2). We find that model results for historical global estimates for SOC stocks are at the upper end of available literature, with ∼2650 Pg C of SOC stored globally in the year 2018, ∼170 Pg C of which is stored in cropland soils. In future projections, assuming no further changes in current cropland patterns and under four different management assumptions with two different climate forcings, RCP2.6 and RCP8.5, results suggest that agricultural SOC stocks decline in all scenarios, as the decomposition of SOC outweighs the increase in carbon inputs into the soil from altered management practices. Different climate change scenarios, as well as assumptions on tillage management, play a minor role in explaining differences in SOC stocks. The choice of tillage practice explains between 0.2 % and 1.3 % of total cropland SOC stock change in the year 2100. Future dynamics in cropland SOC are most strongly controlled by residue management: whether residues are left on the field or harvested. We find that on current cropland, global cropland SOC stocks decline until the end of the century by only 1.0 % to 1.4 % if residue retention management systems are generally applied and by 26.7 % to 27.3 % in the case of residue harvest. For different climatic regions, increases in cropland SOC can only be found for tropical dry, warm temperate moist, and warm temperate dry regions in management systems that retain residues.","BackgroundIn June 2018, the European Parliament and Council of the European Union adopted a legislative regulation for incorporating greenhouse gas emissions and removals from Land Use, Land Use Change and Forestry (EU-LULUCF) under its 2030 Climate and Energy Framework. The LULUCF regulation aim to incentivise EU Member States to decrease greenhouse gas emissions and increase removals in the LULUCF sector. The regulation, however, does not set a target for increasing the LULUCF carbon sink, but rather includes a ‘no net debit’ target for LULUCF (Forests and Agricultural soils). For Managed Forest Land (MFL) an accounting framework with capped credits for additional mitigation against a set forest reference level (FRL) was agreed for 2021–2030. The FRL gives the projected future carbon sink in the two compliance periods 2021–2025 and 2026–2030 under “continuation of forest management practices as they were in the reference period 2000–2009”. This FRL was disputed by some Member States as it was perceived to put a limit on their future wood harvesting from MFL. Here we simulated with the EFISCEN European forest model the “continuation of forest management practices” and determined the corresponding wood harvest for 26 EU countries under progressing age classes.ResultsThe simulations showed that under “continuation of forest management practices” the harvest (wood removals) in the 26 EU countries as a whole can increase from 420 million m3/year in 2000–2009 to 560 million m3/year in 2050 due to progressing age classes. This implies there is a possibility to increase absolute wood harvests without creating debits compared to the forest reference level. However, the manner in which ‘continuation of forest management’ developed with a progressing age class development over time, meant that in some countries the future harvesting exceeded 90% of the increment. Since this generally is considered to be unsustainable we additionally set a harvesting cut-off as max 90% of increment to be harvested for each individual country as a possible interpretation of sustainability criteria that are included in the regulation. Using this additional limit the projected harvest will only increase to 493 million m3/year.ConclusionsThe worry from Member States (MS) that the FRL will prevent any additional harvesting seems unwarranted. Due to differences between Member States concerning the state of their forest resources, the FRL as a baseline for harvesting works out very differently for the different Member States. The FRL may have other unforeseen consequences which we discuss. Under all scenarios the living forest biomass sink shows a decline. This can be counteracted through incentivising measures under Climate Smart Forestry.","Increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases (GHGs) are causing global climate change and decreasing the stability of the climate system. Long-term solutions to climate change will require reduction in GHG emissions as well as the removal of large quantities of GHGs from the atmosphere. Natural climate solutions (NCS), i.e., changes in land management, ecosystem restoration, and avoided conversion of habitats, have substantial potential to meet global and national greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction targets and contribute to the global drawdown of GHGs. However, the relative role of NCS to contribute to GHG reduction at subnational scales is not well known. We examined the potential for 12 NCS activities on natural and working lands in Oregon, USA to reduce GHG emissions in the context of the state’s climate mitigation goals. We evaluated three alternative scenarios wherein NCS implementation increased across the applicable private or public land base, depending on the activity, and estimated the annual GHG reduction in carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2e) attributable to NCS from 2020 to 2050. We found that NCS within Oregon could contribute annual GHG emission reductions of 2.7 to 8.3 MMT CO2e by 2035 and 2.9 to 9.8 MMT CO2e by 2050. Changes in forest-based activities including deferred timber harvest, riparian reforestation, and replanting after wildfires contributed most to potential GHG reductions (76 to 94% of the overall annual reductions), followed by changes to agricultural management through no-till, cover crops, and nitrogen management (3 to 15% of overall annual reductions). GHG reduction benefits are relatively high per unit area for avoided conversion of forests (125–400 MT CO2e ha-1). However, the existing land use policy in Oregon limits the current geographic extent of active conversion of natural lands and thus, avoided conversions results in modest overall potential GHG reduction benefits (i.e., less than 5% of the overall annual reductions). Tidal wetland restoration, which has high per unit area carbon sequestration benefits (8.8 MT CO2e ha-1 yr-1), also has limited possible geographic extent resulting in low potential (< 1%) of state-level GHG reduction contributions. However, co-benefits such as improved habitat and water quality delivered by restoration NCS pathways are substantial. Ultimately, reducing GHG emissions and increasing carbon sequestration to combat climate change will require actions across multiple sectors. We demonstrate that the adoption of alternative land management practices on working lands and avoided conversion and restoration of native habitats can achieve meaningful state-level GHG reductions.","Abstract. While the Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research (EDGAR) focuses on global estimates for the full set of anthropogenic activities, the Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF) sector might be the most diverse and most challenging to cover consistently for all countries of the world. Parties to United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) are required to provide periodic estimates of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, following the latest approved methodological guidance by the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The current study aims to consistently estimate the carbon (C) stock changes from living forest biomass for all countries of the world, in order to complete the LULUCF sector in EDGAR. In order to derive comparable estimates for developing and developed countries, it is crucial to use a single methodology with global applicability. Data for developing countries are generally poor, such that only the Tier 1 methods from either the IPCC Good Practice Guide for Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry (GPG-LULUCF) 2003 or the IPCC 2006 Guidelines can be applied to these countries. For this purpose, we applied the IPCC Tier 1 method at global level following both IPCC GPG-LULUCF 2003 and IPCC 2006, using spatially coarse activity data (i.e. area, obtained combining two different global forest maps: the Global Land Cover map and the eco-zones subdivision of the Global Ecological Zone (GEZ) map) in combination with the IPCC default C stocks and C stock change factors. Results for the C stock changes were calculated separately for gains, harvest, fires (Global Fire Emissions Database version 3, GFEDv.3) and net deforestation for the years 1990, 2000, 2005 and 2010. At the global level, results obtained with the two sets of IPCC guidance differed by about 40 %, due to different assumptions and default factors. The IPCC Tier 1 method unavoidably introduced high uncertainties due to the ""globalization"" of parameters. When the results using IPCC 2006 for Annex I Parties are compared to other international datasets such as (UNFCCC, Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)) or scientific publications, a significant overestimation of the sink emerges. For developing countries, we conclude that C stock change in forest remaining forest can hardly be estimated with the Tier 1 method especially for calculating the C losses, mainly because wood removal data are not separately available on harvesting or deforestation. Overall, confronting the IPCC GPG-LULUCF 2003 and IPCC 2006 methodologies, we conclude that IPCC 2006 suits best the needs of EDGAR and provide a consistent global picture of C stock changes from living forest biomass independent of country estimates.","The U.S. Department of Agriculture Forest Service (USFS) manages one-fifth of the area of forestland in the United States. The Forest Service Roadmap for responding to climate change identified assessing and managing carbon stocks and change as a major element of its plan. This study presents methods and results of estimating current forest carbon stocks and change in the United States for public and private owners, consistent with the official 2010 U.S. greenhouse gas inventory, but with improved data sources for three states. Results are presented by National Forest System region, a major organizational management unit within the Forest Service, and by individual national forest. USFS forestland in the United States is estimated to contain an average of 192 Mg C/ha (mega grams carbon per hectare) on 60.4 million ha, for a total of 1 1,604 Tg C (teragrams C) in the year 2005. Privately-owned forestland averages 150 Mg C/ha on 173.8 million ha, with forestland of other public owners averaging 169 Mg C/ha on 43.1 million ha. In terms of change, private and USFS ownerships each sequester about a net 150 Tg C O2/yr, but an additional 92 Tg C O2/yr is stored in products from private harvests compared to about 3 Tg C O2/yr from harvest on USFS land. Emissions from other disturbances such as fires, as well as corresponding area estimates of disturbance are also important, but the needed datasets are not yet available. Recommendations are given for improving the estimates.","Soil carbon sequestration (enhanced sinks) is the mechanism responsible for most of the greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation potential in the agriculture sector. Carbon sequestration in grasslands can be determined directly by measuring changes in soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks and indirectly by measuring the net balance of C fluxes. A literature search shows that grassland C sequestration reaches on average 5 ± 30 g C/m2 per year according to inventories of SOC stocks and -231 and 77 g C/m2 per year for drained organic and mineral soils, respectively, according to C flux balance. Off-site C sequestration occurs whenever more manure C is produced by than returned to a grassland plot. The sum of on- and off-site C sequestration reaches 129, 98 and 71 g C/m2 per year for grazed, cut and mixed European grasslands on mineral soils, respectively, however with high uncertainty. A range of management practices reduce C losses and increase C sequestration: (i) avoiding soil tillage and the conversion of grasslands to arable use, (ii) moderately intensifying nutrient-poor permanent grasslands, (iii) using light grazing instead of heavy grazing, (iv) increasing the duration of grass leys; (v) converting grass leys to grass-legume mixtures or to permanent grasslands. With nine European sites, direct emissions of N2O from soil and of CH4 from enteric fermentation at grazing, expressed in CO2 equivalents, compensated 10% and 34% of the on-site grassland C sequestration, respectively. Digestion inside the barn of the harvested herbage leads to further emissions of CH4 and N2O by the production systems, which were estimated at 130 g CO2 equivalents/m2 per year. The net balance of on- and off-site C sequestration, CH4 and N2O emissions reached 38 g CO2 equivalents/m2 per year, indicating a non-significant net sink activity. This net balance was, however, negative for intensively managed cut sites indicating a source to the atmosphere. In conclusion, this review confirms that grassland C sequestration has a strong potential to partly mitigate the GHG balance of ruminant production systems. However, as soil C sequestration is both reversible and vulnerable to disturbance, biodiversity loss and climate change, CH4 and N2O emissions from the livestock sector need to be reduced and current SOC stocks preserved.","In the twenty-first century, modern bioenergy could become one of the largest sources of energy, partially replacing fossil fuels and contributing to climate change mitigation. Agricultural and forestry biomass residues form an inexpensive bioenergy feedstock with low greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, if harvested sustainably. We analysed quantities of biomass residues supplied for energy and their sensitivities in harmonised bioenergy demand scenarios across eight integrated assessment models (IAMs) and compared them with literature-estimated residue availability. IAM results vary substantially, at both global and regional scales, but suggest that residues could meet 7–50% of bioenergy demand towards 2050, and 2–30% towards 2100, in a scenario with 300 EJ/year of exogenous bioenergy demand towards 2100. When considering mean literature-estimated availability, residues could provide around 55 EJ/year by 2050. Inter-model differences primarily arise from model structure, assumptions, and the representation of agriculture and forestry. Despite these differences, drivers of residues supplied and underlying cost dynamics are largely similar across models. Higher bioenergy demand or biomass prices increase the quantity of residues supplied for energy, though their effects level off as residues become depleted. GHG emission pricing and land protection can increase the costs of using land for lignocellulosic bioenergy crop cultivation, which increases residue use at the expense of lignocellulosic bioenergy crops. In most IAMs and scenarios, supplied residues in 2050 are within literature-estimated residue availability, but outliers and sustainability concerns warrant further exploration. We conclude that residues can cost-competitively play an important role in the twenty-first century bioenergy supply, though uncertainties remain concerning (regional) forestry and agricultural production and resulting residue supply potentials.",18.2155186336236,Carbon Emission

The changing climate is a global challenge to sustainable livelihoods and economic development. Peasant farmers in Zimbabwe depend entirely on rain-fed agriculture, a situation that makes agriculture and rural livelihoods vulnerable to climate change. This paper discusses the findings of the study carried out in the Zvimba District amongst peasant farmers on their knowledge of climate change impacts and adaptation strategies. Semi-structured interviews, observations and document analysis were used as methodologies for data collection for the study. Purposeful sampling technique was applied to 40 peasant farmers. Qualitative data from interviews and focus group discussion were analysed using context analysis. Households acknowledged that rainfall amount has decreased over the last 30 years. Such changes have reduced agricultural productivity, and in response, communities have developed multiple adaptation strategies such as harnessing social capital, crop and livelihood diversification, engaging in small businesses and water harvesting for livestock keeping. The study concludes that there is a need to recognise the validity of indigenous knowledge and an inventory should be created for future use. The paper notes that diversification of adaptive strategies is vital for sustainable livelihood in a changing climate.

Quantitative and qualitative approaches (Rapid Rural Appraisal, focus group discussions, and semi – structured interview schedule) were used to elicit information from a total of 500 farmers, which were selected using multistage random sampling technique. Findings revealed that 84% and 79% of the farmers were aware and knowledgeable of climate change issues, respectively, while 81% of them noted that they had at various times experienced climate change incidences. Farmers reported that factors which informed their perception of climate change incidence were: unusual early rains followed by weeks of dryness (M= 2.84), erratic rainfall pattern (M= 2.66), drought (M=2.68), reduction in farm yields (M=2.68) and high rate of disease incidence (M= 2.67). Adaptive measures used by the farmers in northern Nigeria included: changes in planting dates (88.4%) and harvesting dates (85.4%), multiple cropping (81.8%), intensive manure application (69.2%), shift to different sites (56.8%) and use of wetland/river valley (fadama) for farming (52.6%). The study concludes that there is need for government to make concrete efforts to enact appropriate policies on climate change adaptation and assist local farmers in the short and long term to improve their resilience to climate change impact.","The negative impacts of climate change on agriculture could erode gains made toward gender equality in Ghana. Much of the literature on gender dimensions of climate change adaptation has focused on assessing differences in coping and adaptation practices of smallholder farmers. Mostly overlooked is whether gender influences influenced perception of effectiveness of adaptation practices and preferences for institutional support for future adaptation. Using key informant interviews, household surveys, and focus group discussions, we address these gaps by exploring coping and adaptation measures adopted by heads of farm households to counter climate change impacts on their livelihood activities and household well-being in the Guinea Savanna agroecological zone in Ghana. Additionally, we assessed the preferred institutional adaptation support of heads of farm households in adapting to future projected impacts. We find that female heads of farm households relied mainly on borrowed money from village savings and loans group as a coping measure; male heads of farm households depended primarily on sales of livestock. Varying planting and harvesting dates, crop diversification, and use of improved crop varieties were the major adaptation strategies adopted by farmers. We argue that provision of dams and/or dugouts, postharvest processing facilities, adaptation capacity-building resources, and improved access to markets and credit could enhance the adaptive capacity of male and female heads of farm households to mitigate projected climate change impacts on their livelihood activities and household well-being.","Water stress is one of the risks emanating from worsening climatic variations. It poses serious threats on vulnerable continents, people and livelihoods globally. However, little information is available on how the specific climate threat is impacting people’s livelihoods and water resources on different temporal and spatial scales in Nigeria basins. This study aimed at investigating household vulnerability and adaptation to water stress induced by climate variability on a downstream Kaduna River basin with the goal of supporting/facilitating climate change adaptation. The research analyzed hydro-climatic data and employed vulnerability-based framework consistent with stakeholders’ participatory approach, within the context of current climate conditions experienced, and/or water stress conditions already affecting household livelihoods in six communities at three study sites; Shiroro, Gbako and Lavun, and adaptive strategies engaged to deal with water stress. Findings revealed that households have been exposed and experienced changes in water availability through variations in rainfall, temperature and runoff. Consequently, these changes have impacted on food production and livelihoods. Households have individually and collectively employed adaptation techniques which are reactive, short-term indigenous coping strategies usually adopted during periods of stress to minimize water-related vulnerabilities. The study demonstrated how an understanding of the local household vulnerabilities will enable the recognition of early indicators of water stress in addition to the occurrence of extreme events. Overall, households’ vulnerability decreased from one village to another due to differences in sensitivity to stress, access to resources and local institutional capacity. Resilience of households can be increased through early warning system during flood events, providing access to water from rainwater harvesting techniques, and integration of climate change adaptation into policies regarding development initiatives especially in the area of agriculture.","This article is concerned with the adoption of small-scale irrigation farming as a climate-smart agriculture practice and its influence on household income in the Chinyanja Triangle. Chinyanja Triangle is a region that is increasingly experiencing mid-season dry spells and an increase in occurrence of drought, which is attributed largely to climate variability and change. This poses high agricultural production risks, which aggravate poverty and food insecurity. For this region, adoption of small-scale irrigation farming as a climate-smart agriculture practice is very important. Through a binary logistic and ordinary least squares regression, this article determines factors that influence the adoption of small-scale irrigation farming as a climate-smart agriculture practice and its influence on income among smallholder farmers. The results show that off-farm employment, access to irrigation equipment, access to reliable water sources and awareness of water conservation practices, such as rainwater harvesting, have a significant influence on the adoption of small-scale irrigation farming. On the other hand, the farmer’s age, distance travelled to the nearest market and nature of employment negatively influence the adoption of small-scale irrigation farming decisions. Ordinary least squares regression results showed that the adoption of small-scale irrigation farming as a climate-smart agriculture practice has a significant positive influence on agricultural income. We therefore conclude that to empower smallholder farmers to respond quickly to climate variability and change, practices that will enhance the adoption of small-scale irrigation farming in the Chinyanja Triangle are critical, as this will significantly affect agricultural income. In terms of policy, we recommend that the governments of Zambia, Malawi and Mozambique, which cover the Chinyanja Triangle, formulate policies that will enhance the adoption of sustainable small scale-irrigation farming as a climate-smart agriculture practice. This will go a long way in mitigating the adverse effects that accompany climate variability and change in the region.","The majority of small – scale farmers in the Vhembe district have been experiencing extreme climatic risk, high climate variability and change for a very long time. The majority of these small –scale farmers are vulnerable to all types of climate risk due to their low adaptive capacity, lack of access to technology as a result of level of education, lack of financial resources and also among other things low level of resilience and high level of poverty amongst these farmers. However, the majority of these small – scale farmers in the Vhembe district use different adaptive strategies as a way of preserving assets for future livelihoods including: (a) Drought resistant varieties, (b) Crop diversification, (c) Plant crops that require less water, (d) Some of these small – scale farmers use local climate indicators to monitor climate risk, (e) Adjust fertilizer input, (f) Use rainwater harvesting techniques. Different institutions in the country including the South African Weather Services, and the Agricultural Research Council, and the Limpopo Provincial Department of Agriculture, issue and disseminate the seasonal forecasts information to different districts including the Vhembe. Most of the time, the information has been disseminated to end-users in simple ways, but the need to find more out more about end users’ needs is still required.","Climate change is a global challenge to both sustainable livelihoods and economic development. In Tanzania as in most African countries, farming depends almost entirely on rainfall, a situation that makes agriculture and thus rural livelihoods especially in semiarid environments particularly vulnerable to climate change. This study analyses the impacts of climate change and variability on rural livelihoods with particular focus on agricultural production, food security and adaptive capacities in semiarid areas of Tanzania. The methods used in this study included focus group discussions, key informant interviews, household surveys and field observations. Results from the study indicate that communities understood climate change in terms of variability in rainfall patterns and amount, temperature patterns, wind, water availability, increased incidences of drought and decreased agricultural productivity. Communities in the study area acknowledged that while rainfall amounts have decreased over the last thirty years, temperatures have increased; an experience is also supported by meteorological data. Such changes were claimed to have reduced agricultural productivity particularly due to prolonged drought, inadequate and uneven distribution of rainfall as well as unpredictable onset and ending of rains. Stressors such as crop diseases and pests, low soil fertility and inadequate extension services were also reported to contribute to the decline in agricultural productivity and re-occurrence of food insecurity. In response, communities have developed multiple adaptation strategies, including growing of drought tolerant and early maturing crop varieties, increasing wetlands cultivation, water harvesting for small-scale irrigation and livestock keeping. However, households with limited livelihood assets are more vulnerable to the impacts of climate change and food insecurity. The study argues that diversification of adaptive strategies, such as water harvesting for small-scale irrigation, integration of livestock and crop production are crucial to ensuring sustainable livelihood in a changing climate.","Climate change is a great environmental challenge facing humanity today. In Yatta District, residents report frequent crop failures, water shortages and relief food has become a frequent feature of their life. This study examines the adaptation strategies to climate change adopted by the dry-land farming communities in Yatta District. Study participants included 510 randomly sampled small-scale farmers. Key informants were district departmental heads from the Ministries of Water, Agriculture and Environment. Questionnaires, interviews, Focus Group Discussions and field observations were used to generate the data. Quantitative data was analysed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) whereas qualitative data was analysed through establishing the categories and themes, relationships/patterns and conclusions drawn in line with the study objectives. Findings indicate that most farmers adopted autonomous adaptation strategies that included planting drought tolerant crops (76.5%), charcoal burning (52.9%) and rainwater harvesting (20.2%) among others. Chi square results indicated that age, level of education and knowledge of climate change had significant influences on adaptation strategies. Some of these strategies had serious adverse environmental impacts on social, economic and biophysical domains of the environment like putting future agricultural production at risk since farms have been converted into sand mining fields. Major limitations to climate change adaptation were financial constraints (93.4%), lack of relevant skills (74.5%) and lack of scientific and technical knowledge (71.6%). The study concludes that farmers are engaging in adaptation strategies that are fundamentally changes in livelihoods and mainly unsustainable. Livelihood activities such as charcoal burning and sand harvesting in their fragile arid and semi-arid lands ecosystem are destructive and thus, not sustainable. These livelihood changes are significantly influenced by levels of education and climate change knowledge. The study recommends that agricultural extension services be enhanced to sensitize the farmers about climate change thus improving their perception and adaptation strategies.   Key words: Climate change, small-scale farmers, adaptation strategies.","The study examines how farmers’ observations of climate variability and change correspond with 42 years (1970-2011) meteorological data of temperature and rainfall. It shows how farmers in the Northern Region of Ghana adjust to the changing climate and explore the various obstacles that hinder the implementation of their adaptation strategies. With the help of an extension officer, 200 farmers from 20 communities were randomly selected based on their farming records. Temperatures over the last four decades (1970-2009) increased at a rate of 0.04 (± 0.41) ˚C and 0.3(± 0.13)˚C from 2010-2011 which is consistent to the farmers (82.5%) observations. Rainfall within the districts are characterised by inter-annual and monthly variability. It experienced an increased rate of 0.66 (± 8.30) mm from 1970-2009, which was inconsistent with the farmers (81.5%) observation. It however decreased from 2010-2011 at a huge rate of -22.49 (±15.90) mm which probably was the reason majority of the respondents claim rainfall was decreasing. Only 64.5% of the respondents had adjusted their farming activities because of climate variability and change. They apply fertilizers and pesticides, practice soil and water conservation, and irrigation for communities close to dams. Respondents desire to continue their current adaptation methods but may in the future consider changing crop variety, water-harvesting techniques, change crop production to livestock keeping, and possibly migrate to urban centers. Lack of climate change education, low access to credit and agricultural inputs are some militating factors crippling the farmers’ effort to adapt to climate change.","One of the biggest threats in the world of agriculture is the occurrence of global climate change which is likely to result in crop failure. Agriculture and climate change have a very close connection, because agricultural sector is very dependent and very vulnerable to climate change, so that the knowledge of farmers in the magnitude of climate change is needed. This study aims to examine the extent to which farmers' knowledge of climate change is happening and the impacts caused by climate change, especially on rice. This research was carried out using qualitative design with ""case study"" techniques, using primary data and secondary data. Determination of informants was carried out purposively, namely farmers who had done farming for ± 10 years who experienced crop failure and who were not with their land ownership status. Data collection techniques used in the form of observation, interviews and literature studies. The design of data analysis uses descriptive analysis. The results of this study indicate that farmers who experience crop failure and who have harvested already know and feel the changes that occur such as changes in planting, changes in temperature, changes in rainfall, extreme weather, and pest attacks, but farmers have not been able to explain what climate change own. The impact felt by farmers due to climate change is that farmers experience a decline in yields, increased pest attacks, increased risk of crop failure and a decrease in farmers' income.",19.2682883526004,Resource Impact

To probe this issue, this research investigated the impact of two levels of crop thinning and of basal leaf removal at three phenological stages in the 2011 and 2012 growing seasons in Michigan. Experiments were conducted at the Southwest Michigan Research and Extension Center (SWMREC) in Benton Harbor. Using ‘Cabernet franc’ (Vitis vinifera L.) vines, yield components (yield per vine, pruning weight, and cluster and berry weight) and basic fruit composition traits [total soluble solids (TSS), pH, titratable acidity, anthocyanins, and phenolics) were studied to investigate the effect of cluster thinning and basal leaf removal on vine performance and fruit quality at harvest. Neither of the treatments significantly impacted TSS in either of the two seasons. Cluster thinning treatment successfully altered cropload ratio, indexed as Ravaz Index (RI), independently of the time of application. Basal leaf removal increased exposed berry temperature, cluster light exposure, and subsequent anthocyanin and phenolic content of the berry in both seasons, again independent of application date, whereas cluster thinning was effective only in 2012. Crop thinning coupled with basal leaf removal resulted in an increased efficiency in anthocyanin accumulation in relation to TSS accumulation, expressed as anthocyanin:sugar, in both years. This is significant because it offers potential for vineyard management practices aiming to improve fruit quality in cool climates where the onset of anthocyanin accumulation could be reduced and decoupled from sugar accumulation. The concentration levels of several chemical components of wine grape, including TSS, organic acids, polyphenols, and flavor compounds, determine technological maturity of fruit at harvest (Mattivi et al., 2006). Together, they are the critical contributors to final wine quality and each constituent responds differently to various environmental factors like sunlight, temperature, humidity, water stress, and soil nutrition (Downey et al., 2006; Lakso and Kliewer, 1975, 1977; Parra et al., 2010; Ryona et al., 2008; Smart and Robinson, 2008; Spayd et al., 2002). Vineyard management is critical to achieve optimal fruit maturity and many viticultural practices have been studied including canopy management, e.g., basal leaf removal, irrigation, soil conditioning, and crop thinning, in cool and hot–warm climates (Bavaresco et al., 2008; Bledsoe et al., 1988; Keller et al., 2005; Reynolds et al, 1996; Sadras and McCarthy, 2007). However, climate often influences cultural treatments and, in viticultural regions like Michigan characterized by cool and short growing seasons of considerable annual variability, the most important tools to achieve desired fruit chemistry and maturity are optimizing vine balance and managing the vine canopy to improve the fruit zone microclimate (Howell, 2001). The ratio between vegetative growth and reproductive growth is manipulated to achieve targeted fruit characteristics and often indexed as cropload, the ratio between fruit yield and 1-year-old cane pruning weight (Ravaz, 1911) or referred to as the RI. Generally, a cropload with an RI from 5 to 10 is considered indicative of a balanced vine (Kliewer and Dokoozlian, 2005). Similar to RI, a ratio of leaf area to fruit weight from 8 to 12 cm·g is also regarded as the hallmark of a balanced vine (Kliewer and Dokoozlian, 2005). For wine grape, an RI exceeding 12 indicates overcropping and less than 5 undercropping vine status, corresponding to leaf area to fruit weight of less of 8 cm·g or more than 14 cm·g, respectively (Kliewer and Dokoozlian, 2005), particularly for vines grown on a vertical shoot positioning trellis (VSP), most common used training system in cool climate viticulture. In a cool climate, with its low heat accumulation [growing degree-days (GDD)] and short growing seasons, a higher amount of leaf area and, therefore, a lower cropload is suggested to ripen the fruit to a desired level (Howell, 2001; Tozzini et al., 2013). Canopy management techniques such as basal leaf removal are frequently used to increase sunlight exposure and exposed berry temperature (Bledsoe et al., 1988; Smart and Robinson, 2008). Cluster exposure increases polyphenols and decreases acidity in cool climates (Cortell and Kennedy, 2006; Downey et al., 2004; Price et al., 1995; Spayd et al., 2002). However, the timing of basal leaf removal appears to be critical; when performed too early, it results in the loss of leaf area with a significant decrease in the amount of photosynthesis and the associated production of carbohydrates for berry development (Palliotti et al., 2011) and the potential of modify the relationship between total soluble solids (mostly sugars) and anthocyanin accumulation, inducing a decoupling effect as reported by Sadras and Moran (2012). This 2-year research project was designed to study the effects of cluster thinning and cluster microclimate (temperature and incident solar radiation) modified by basal leaf removal on vine growth and fruit composition of mature ‘Cabernet franc’ grown in the cool Michigan climate. Specifically, it was our goal to identify the efficacy of selected timings of the two major cultural practices for advancing fruit ripening and achieving targeted quality traits, especially with respect to the concentrations of sugars, anthocyanins, and phenolics at harvest.

The climate here is characterized by a short growing season (145 to 175 d) with cool-climate summer conditions (1300 ± 300 GDD, calculated beginning 1 Apr. to 31 Oct. using base 10 C). The experimental vineyard consisted of 10 rows and 48 vines per row with spacing of 2.4 m between vines and 3.0 m between rows. Rows were planted in a north-to-south orientation and vines were trained with a VSP trellis system. Vines were planted in Spinks sandy loam soil (U.S. Department of Agriculture, 1957) and spurpruned to 48 nodes per vine during the winter. Vines were trained with multiple trunks to ensure survival of at least part of the vine through damaging winter temperatures (Pool and Howard, 1984). During the growing season, shoots were hedged when the tips were 30 cm above the catch wire to maintain a canopy free of excessive shading and, subsequently, to prevent a reduction in heat accumulation (Sadras and Moran, 2012). After bloom, 90 clusters were left on each vine considered in the study. Standard commercial pest-control practices were applied during the season based on scouting, experience, and weather conditions (Wise et al., 2008). Monthly rainfall and cumulative GDD during the growing season were obtained from the Michigan Automated Weather Network station at SWMREC, located 300 m from the site of the experiment. Additional weather data details and parameters can be accessed at <http://www.enviro-weather.msu. edu/weather.php?stn=swm>. Field experimental design and treatments. The experimental design was a randomized complete block with eight blocks and three factors (cropload, leaf removal, and timing of treatment application) and four single vine replications per each treatment. The crop was manually adjusted according to a low crop and high crop level with 40 (40 ± 11 SD in 2011 and 40 ± 10 SD in 2012) and 80 (80 ± 16 SD in 2011 and 80 ± 14 SD in 2012) clusters per vine, respectively. To study the effect of cluster microclimatic conditions on fruit composition and quality, two levels of cluster exposure to sunlight were designed: on selected vines, the first six nodes of each shoot were defoliated (leaf removal), whereas the other treatment was left undefoliated (no leaf removal). The simultaneous application of the yield level and cluster exposure treatments was assigned to three different timings: fruit set, 3 weeks before veraison, and veraison. Canopy growth measurement. Shoot length was monitored weekly from June until hedging, which was performed before veraison (end of July) in both seasons. Five modal shoots per vine were selected and total leaf area was estimated based on the regression between shoot length and shoot leaf area using a non-destructive method. Weekly, 20 shoots were sampled randomly from guard vines from bloom to veraison and shoot length was recorded and leaf area per shoot was measured using a leaf area meter (LI-3100 area meter; LI-COR, Lincoln, NE). The equation of the regression between leaf area and shoot length (y = 23.0 x – 510.7, r = 0.97) was used to estimate leaf area for the five tagged shoots according to Mabrouk and Carbonneau (1996). At the three times of treatment application, six basal leaves were removed from each tagged shoot, placed in zip-lock sampling bags, and transported to the laboratory where their total leaf area was measured and recorded to estimate the percentage of leaf area remov","Baby-leaf salad green crops such as lettuce (Lactuca sativa), kale (Brassica oleracea), arugula (Eruca sativa), andmustard greens (Brassica juncea) thrive in the cool, humid climate of themaritime Pacific Northwest, particularly in the extended spring and fall seasons. To identify cultivars best suited for extended-season production in northwest Washington, nine leafy green cultivars were grown at two locations in the spring and fall seasons for 2 years. A high level of variability in crop performance was observed between seasons, locations, years, planting dates, and cultivars, indicating low-yield stability in baby-leaf salad crops across diverse environments and conditions. Overall, cultivars had a higher marketable weight in the spring than in the fall. Marketable weight was higher in Spring 2013 than in Spring 2014, and was higher in Fall 2013 than in Fall 2012. Days to harvest (DTH) were shorter in the spring than in the fall both years, and in both seasons DTH varied by’1 week between the two trial locations. Fresh weed biomass was almost 5.5 times higher in spring than in fall both years. Overall, pak choi ‘Joi Choi’ and mustard ‘Komatsuna’ had the highest marketable weight, lowest DTH, and lowest weed biomass across the widest range of environments and conditions, while beet ‘Bull’s Blood’ had the lowest marketable weight, relatively long DTH and highest weed biomass. These results suggest that baby-leaf salad crop cultivar selection differs for spring and fall seasons, and production can be highly variable between years and locations. Further, results suggest that growers should plant a diversity of crop cultivars each season to protect from crop loss and to achieve overall yield stability. Ready-to-eat salad mix has experienced more than a 5-fold increase in supermarket sales over the last 20 years in the United States, increasing from $197 million in 1993 to $2.7 billion in 2008, while the sales of iceberg and romaine head lettuce have decreased (Cook, 2008). Bagged ready-to-eat salad mixes were first widely distributed in supermarkets in 1989, and were composed of mature heads of lettuce (Lactuca sativa; primarily iceberg type) cut into bite-sized pieces using specialized head lettuceprocessing equipment (Thompson andWilson, 1999). Today, a diverse array of leafy green salad crops are grown for baby-leaf salad mix in the United States, including lettuce, spinach (Spinacea oleracea L.), mustard greens (Brassica juncea L. and Brassica oleracea L.), pak choi (Brassica rapa L.), kale (Brassica oleracea L.), arugula (Eruca sativa L. and Diplotaxis tenuifolia L.), and beet greens (Beta vulgaris L.) (Hardesty and Leff, 2009). Although the widespread consumption and distribution of baby-leaf salad mix is a relatively recent development in the United States, the practice of harvesting leafy greens at an immature stage of development originated with the concept of mesclun, or ‘‘spring mix’’ in Provence, France, in the 1700s andwas introduced to American cuisine in metropolitan restaurants in the late 1960s (Hardesty, 2010). Growers in California and Arizona are able to produce leafy green salad crops yearround because of the region’s mild winter climate (Koike et al., 2011; Reader, 2003; Smith et al., 2011). These two states accounted for 96% of all lettuce grown in the United States in 2012, and the Salinas Valley alone accounted for 70% of leafy green salad crops (City of Salinas EconomicDevelopment, 2013; USDA, 2010), which included 57,200 t of spring mix, 15,100 t of baby-leaf spinach, 11,800 t of radicchio (Cichorium intybus L.), 21,900 t of kale, and 945,000 t of leaf lettuce (Monterey County Crop Report, 2012). In most other states, leafy green salad crops are grown seasonally on smallandmoderate-sized farms, with over 70% of lettuce and over 60% of spinach producers growing less than one-half hectare (USDA, 2010, 2012b, 2014). In Washington State, lettuce was produced on 222 farms totaling 83 ha in 2012 with leaf lettuce as the dominant lettuce type, followed by crisphead and romaine types (USDA, 2012b). Spinachwas produced on 44 farms totaling 64 ha in 2012. There is strong demand in northwest Washington for locally grown baby-leaf salad greens. While the market is well supplied throughout the summer in this region because of the mild climate that is conducive to baby-leaf salad green production, growers require production information to enable them to extend the season as much as possible in the spring and fall. Research on salad crop production has historically focused on crop performance at the mature growth stage (Clarkson et al., 2003; Farnham and Garrett, 1996; Hoque et al., 2010; Sanchez and El-Hout, 1995; Zhao and Carey, 2009). Babyleaf salad greens are harvested between 30 and 45 d after planting, and in recent studies it has been shown that cultivar performance at the baby-leaf stage differs from performance at the mature stage because of physiological and morphological differences between the developmental stages (Borrelli et al., 2013; Coolong et al., 2013; Egea-Gilabert et al., 2013;Wallace et al., 2012). The objective of this experiment was to evaluate nine salad crop cultivars for suitability as baby-leaf salad greens in the spring (April–June) and six cultivars for the fall (September–November) growing seasons in northwest Washington. Overall productivity, earliness, and ability to compete with weeds were measured. Materials and Methods This study was conducted at two locations 65 km apart in northwest Washington: Cloud Mountain Farm Center (CMFC) in Everson, and Washington State University’s Northwestern Washington Research and Extension Center (WSU NWREC) in Mount Vernon.

Weather data including air temperature, relative humidity, soil temperature, and light transmission (photosynthetically active radiation) were monitored at both field sites with aHOBOweather station (Onset Corporation, Bourne, MA). The CMFC location was managed organically as per U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) guidelines, and the WSU NWREC location was in transition to certified organic. At CMFC, a mixed small grain and pea cover crop was grown before the field study, and a pea cover crop was grown previously at WSU NWREC. At both locations the research design was a randomized complete split block with three replications. The main plot was planting date and the split plot treatment was cultivar. The study included two planting dates, 2 weeks apart, in the spring and fall seasons, and was repeated for 2 years. There were nine cultivars in the spring season, and six in the fall season; crop cultivars are provided in Table 2. Plots were one bed wide and 10 m long at both locations. At CMFC, beds were 0.75 m wide and 8 cm high, and at WSU NWREC, beds were 0.75 m wide and 18 cm high; at both locations bed spacing was 1.75 m center-to-center. At both locations, preplant organic fertilizer Wil-Gro Proganic 8-2-4 (Wilbur-Ellis Company, Yakima, WA) was broadcast applied at 56 kg·ha to bed centers before bed shaping. On each bed, cultivars were planted in six rows spaced 10 cm apart. Seed spacing within each rowwas 1 cm and planting rate was 80 seeds per meter-row to achieve a seeding density of 2.7 million seeds/ha. Irrigation was applied at a rate of 36 mm·d three times per week and was adjusted for precipitation. At CMFC, irrigation was applied using microsprinklers (Nelson Irrigation Corporation, Walla Walla, WA), and at NWREC, drip irrigation was applied using two tapes (8-inch emitter spacing, 2.5 L/min/30.5 m; T-Systems International, San Diego, CA) per bed spaced 20 cm apart equidistant from the center of the bed. Weeds were not managed within beds so that weed growth could be measured for each cultivar. Row cover (85% transmittance Agribon AG-19; Polymer Group Inc., Charlotte, NC) was applied to all Brassica crops (mustards ‘Yukina Savoy’, ‘Komatsuna’, and ‘Bekana’, kale ‘Winter Red’, arugula ‘Adagio’, and pak choi ‘Joi Choi’) for spring plantings at WSU NWREC in 2013 and 2014 after flea beetles were observed in those plots. Flea beetle damage at CMFC was negligible, thus rowcover was not used at this site. Rowcover was not applied during the fall at either location as no flea beetle damage was observed during that period. Data collection. Seedling emergence was measured twice weekly in each plot until no newly emerged plants were observed within that plot for a period of 1 week. The center 1 m of each plot was harvested when the majority of plants had leaves 10 cm long (the marketable size for baby-leaf salad). Leaves were cut by hand 3 cm above the soil surface. Although it is possible to harvest baby-leaf salad crops up to three times if the crop is left in the field to regrow, data were only collected for the initial harvest of each plot. Harvest date, weight (g) of marketable leaves, and the fresh weight (g) of weeds in the harvested area were recorded for each plot; however, weeds were not measured at CMFC in Fall 2012 due to an oversight. In this study, damage that rendered leaves unmarketable was primarily because of flea beetle feeding; an insect feeding hole larger than 0.5 cm in diameter classified the leaf as unmarketable per local market acceptability standards. Leaves that exhibited discoloration, decay, or disease symptoms as well as plants that had bolted were also co","Alfalfa is one of the most important, nutritive, and high yielding forage legumes planted across the US. Fall dormancy in alfalfa influences forage yield characteristics and the plants persistence mostly under the cold and temperate climate. The objective of this study was to evaluate alfalfa cultivars with different fall dormancy-ratings for their forage yield at each cut and the annual forage yield. Two sets of 24 alfalfa cultivars were evaluated in a field experiment conducted at the Agricultural Science Center at Farmington, NM. The first set of 24 cultivars was planted late fall 2007 at seeding rate of 22.4 kg ha−1 and managed for the 2007–2011 period and the second set was planted late fall 2009 and managed during the 2009–2013 period. Average forage yield varied with years from 7.6 to 2.9 Mg ha−1, 6.8 to 4.3 Mg ha−1, 9.2 to 4.2 Mg ha−1, and 7.9 to 3.2 Mg ha−1 during the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th alfalfa cut, respectively. The results showed no statistical differences between the moderately dormant, dormant, and the non-dormant alfalfa cultivars while they showed higher forage yield than the very dormant and semi-dormant alfalfa cultivars. There was a decreasing trend in forage yield from the first cut to the fourth cut in each growing season. However, the very dormant cultivars showed the lowest forage yield. Alfalfa forage yield decreased from the cut 1 to the cut 4 which represented on average 33, 29, 22, and 16% of the annual yield. The semi-dormant cultivars obtained the lowest forage yield at the first and second cutting while there was no difference between the cultivars for the third and fourth harvests. Average forage yields per harvest were 5.7, 5.9, 6.0, 5.5, and 5.9 Mg ha−1 for the very dormant, dormant, moderately dormant, semi-dormant, and non-dormant alfalfa cultivars, respectively. Annual forage yield varied with alfalfa fall dormancy-ratings and ranged from 15.5 to 29.9 Mg ha−1 with the highest forage yield achieved during the third years of the production. The moderately dormant and the non-dormant cultivars showed the highest yield during the first harvest year while the very dormant cultivars and dormant cultivars had the lowest forage yield. Alfalfa cultivars with a fall dormancy range 4–5 may be considered for alfalfa production in northwest New Mexico however, the good agricultural practices (conservation tillage, fertilizer management based on soil residual available nutrient and crop requirement, recommended planting rate, weed and pest management, irrigation scheduling to match crop evapotranspiration) should be the most important to maximize alfalfa forage yield in the southwest US.","Simple balance of Cd input by different treatments and removal by agricultural crops was investigated in an ongoing precise long-term field experiment with application of sewage sludge (SS), farmyard manure (FYM), and mineral fertilizers (nPK). Potatoes, wheat and barley were grown in a rotation at 4 experimental sites of the Czech republic with the aim to assess the risk of Cd accumulation in soil and plants under different soil and climate conditions. The results showed significant differences in Cd content of the input materials used, and in Cd inputs to soils under different fertilization managements. Three applications of sewage sludge during 1996–2005 resulted in total addition of 110 g Cd/ha into soil, which was by one order of magnitude higher than Cd addition in FYM or nPK treatments. From the total amount of sludge-borne Cd, only small portion was removed by harvests of crops (approximately 3.5%). Soil conditions significantly affected Cd input-removal balance. The highest Cd removals were obtained on soils with the lowest pH. The highest Cd removal was achieved by potato tubers followed by wheat and barley plants. The results showed that the risk of Cd accumulation in soils is high, especially with repeated sludge applications.","A trial in the San Joaquin Valley of California investigated how the interaction of pruning systems and mechanical shoot thinning affected canopy performance, yield components, fruit phenolic composition at harvest, and production efficiency of a procumbent cultivar in a warm climate grape-growing region. Two pruning systems and three shoot thinning treatments were arranged factorially in a randomized complete block design with four replications. The pruning methods were applied by either handpruning to a target of 25 nodes/m or mechanically hedging and retaining a 100-mm spur height. The shoot density treatments were applied mechanically at a modified EichhornLorenz scale, stage 17 to retain 40 or 45 shoots/m of a row, or left unthinned. The contribution of count shoots to total shoots increased when mechanical box pruning replaced spur pruning. The contribution of percent count shoots to total shoots was greatest with 40 shoots/m and unthinned treatments. The percent photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) transmission and percent canopy gaps increased with mechanical box pruning and also with the decrease in shoot density per meter of row. Berry and cluster size decreased with mechanical box pruning application. However, because mechanically box-pruned vines carried more clusters, yield per meter of row increased. There was a quadratic response to shoot thinning where berry skin phenolics, anthocyanins, and tannins decreased with the 45 shoots/m treatment when compared with 40 shoots/m and unthinned treatments. Pruning weight per meter of row and leaf area-tofruit ratio decreased, whereas Ravaz Index (kg yield/kg pruning weight) increased with mechanical box pruning. Shoot thinning treatments did not affect pruning weight per meter of row or leaf area-to-fruit ratio. Increasing amount of PAR and percent canopy gaps by shoot thinning resulted in vegetative compensation from a sparsely populated grapevine canopy, thereby negating its purported effects. The 40 and 45 shoots/m treatments repopulated the canopy rapidly with non-count shoots thereby increasing the pruning weight per meter of row at the end of the season. In the absence of a physiological response, shoot thinning in a procumbent cultivar is not recommended. Mechanically box pruning to a 100-mm spur height and slowing down vegetative growth by irrigating to 50% of daily evapotranspiration (ETo) variance between fruit set and veraison have resulted in a Ravaz Index window (5 to 10 kg·kg) and is recommended for procumbent red wine grape cultivars for the region with similar or better berry skin phenolic accumulation than spur-pruned vines. The San Joaquin Valley (SJV) of California leads the state in wine grape acreage and tons produced (California Department of Food and Agriculture, 2012). Previously, southern regions of the SJV were classified as only suitable for table grape production (Region V) as a result of their annual growing degree-day (GDD) accumulation (Amerine and Winkler, 1944). However, as the competition for arable land suitable for wine grape production increased in the state, areas that were previously not considered such as Region V are now planted to wine grapes. Much of the wine grapes planted in southern SJV are grown on a twoor three-wire single-curtain, non-shootpositioned trellis (Gladstone and Dokoozlian, 2003) commonly referred to as the California sprawl. This trellis type, although not capitalintensive to install but is often used improperly, results in excessive fruit zone shading with procumbent cultivars, i.e., Syrah (Dokoozlian and Kliewer, 1995; Terry and Kurtural, 2011). Because profit margins are narrow, and maximum yield is paramount, balanced cropping in this region is not possible resulting in large canopies with declining yield and less than ideal fruit composition at the farm gate (Wessner and Kurtural, 2013). The declining yield in southern SJV wine grape vineyards is attributed to mechanical box pruning and irrigating to field capacity that exacerbates the excessive fruit zone shading for procumbent (drooping/trailing growth habit) cultivars (Wessner and Kurtural, 2013). This also results in mutual shading within the canopy in the current season and depresses bud fruitfulness in subsequent seasons (Sanchez and Dokoozlian, 2005). Several studies have shown that node number per vine is a not an accurate or a precise regulator of the final crop level in vineyards (Bernizzoni et al., 2011; Geller and Kurtural, 2013; Poni et al., 2004; Terry and Kurtural, 2011). There is agreement in recent literature that attempts to balance grapevine yield with increased pruning severity fails because of the unpredictable vegetative and reproductive compensating responses from the grapevine (Bernizzoni et al., 2011; Geller and Kurtural, 2013; Kurtural et al., 2006). The compensating responses may include enhanced bursting of secondary shoots (Kurtural et al., 2006; Main and Morris, 2004) as well as more fruitful shoots stemming from latent buds on the cordon and basal buds that are not counted during balanced pruning procedures (Kurtural et al., 2006; Poni et al., 2004). Further enhancements to achieve specific yield targets are therefore achieved with shoot and cluster thinning through manual and mechanical means (Geller and Kurtural, 2013; Kurtural et al., 2006; Terry and Kurtural, 2011). However, these practices require rigorous crop estimation and maybe economically prohibitive (Kurtural et al., 2012) because their application by manual methods may increase labor operation time in the vineyard up to 50 to 60 h·ha (Geller and Kurtural, 2013; Intrieri and Poni, 1995). Shoot thinning in vineyards is applied when average shoot length is between 15 and 25 cm. Smart (1988) reported optimal shoot densities to achieve desired fruit composition and wine sensory properties for cool climate viticulture. He emphasized improved canopy microclimate and function can be achieved with shoot densities of 15 to 25 shoots/m of a row depending on cultivar and location influence. Recently, Geller and Kurtural (2013) recommended a shoot density of 35 shoots/m of a row with a hypocumbent (upright growth habit) cultivar to improve canopy microclimate and to achieve optimum Ravaz Index with a sustainable yield in a warm climate region (Region V of California). Geller and Kurtural (2013) further reported that decreasing shoot density did not provide any further benefit to canopy function. Increasing the severity of shoot thinning resulted in a lack of physiological response as a result of vegetative compensation by the grapevine generating larger leaf area by the remaining shoots on a sparsely populated canopy.

Although there have been various reports on comparisons of mechanical box and spur pruning as well as determination of optimal shoot density in wine grape vineyards, most of these trials were conducted in cooler climates and did not investigate the interaction between them. There are not many specific studies published on mechanical shoot thinning effects on the grapevine grown in Region V with a procumbent grape cultivar such as Syrah. Therefore, our study was designed to investigate how the interaction of pruning systems and mechanical shoot removal affected canopy performance, yield components, fruit phenolic composition at harvest, and production efficiency of a procumbent cultivar in a warm climate region. Materials and Methods Vineyard description and experimental layout This study was conducted from 2009 to 2011 at a commercial vineyard planted with ‘Syrah’ grapevine on ‘SO4’ (V. berlandieri 3 V. riparia) rootstock at 2.1 m 3 3.4-m (vine 3 row) spacing in north to South-oriented rows. The treatments described below were imposed in 2009. Data collection commenced in 2010 to allow the vines to adjust to mechanical manipulation. The research site was located in Kern County, CA (lat. 35 00#322$ N, long. 118 53#808$ W, elevation 137 m) and was planted in 1999 on Premier SandyLoam soil [a coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, calcareous thermic Xeric Torriorthent (U.S. Department of Agriculture, 2011)]. The vines were trained to a bilateral cordon at 1.35 m with two foliage support wires at 1.70 m and a 20-cm T-top. The GDD accumulation at the research site was 2566 and 2561 (10 C base) and 404 mm and 178 mm of precipitation was received in 2010 and 2011, respectively. The vineyard was drip-irrigated with pressure-compensating emitters spaced at 96 cm delivering 1.5 L·h per emitter. The vines were supplied with 12 kg·ha of nitrogen in each year. The vineyard was planted in a resource-limited environment and irrigation was managed uniformly, as follows: the root zone was irrigated beginning in the third week of February based on a crop coefficient (Kc) of 0.2 and 80% of the daily ETo, values for which were obtained from the California Irrigation Management Information System station in Arvin, CA. Irrigation was interrupted before bloom and the soil was allowed to dry down until","In arid climates, fruit doubling has long been recognized as a problem in peaches (Prunus persica L. Batsch) and has been associated with water stress due to drought (Garcia, 1980; Patten, 1989) or deficit irrigation (Johnson et al., 1992; Larson et al., 1988). Another malady of peach fruit, termed deep suture, also seems to be related to water stress. The symptom of this disorder is a deep cleavage in the suture at the stem end of the fruit that extends at least half way toward the blossom end and renders the fruit unmarketable. Whereas most double fruit can be removed by normal hand thinning, deep sutures are difficult to detect on small fruitlets. Substantial water savings can be achieved without sacrificing yield by withholding irrigation of early maturing peach cultivars after harvest (Johnson et al., 1992). The main disadvantage is the increased number of double fruit and deep sutures. This study was initiated to determine if reirrigation during carpel differentiation in the flower buds (late August) could substantially reduce these disorders while still saving water. A 0.5-ha block of central leader-trained ‘Spring Lady’ peach trees on ‘Nemaguard’ rootstock planted in 1984 at a 3.9 × 2.0-m spacing at the Kearney Agricultural Center, Parlier, Calif., was used for this study. The orchard soil was a Hanford sandy loam (typic xerothents) with ≈400 mm of available water in a 3-m soil profile. A randomized completeblock design was used with two treatments and six replications. A plot consisted of eight trees in a row with two border trees on either end and a border row on either side. The control treatment was irrigated every 1 to 2 d from April through October with one 38 L·h –1 microsprinkler per tree. Amounts were based on estimated evapotranspiration (ET c), calculated from reference crop water use (ET o) and crop coefficients (Kc) for deciduous fruit trees (Goldhamer, 1989). The stressed treatment, initiated after harvest in May 1988, was irrigated at the same frequency but received only 25% of the control volume. In 1989 and 1990, the same treatments were imposed after harvest except that half of the deficit irrigation plots were heavily irrigated during the period of carpel differentiation (late August). In 1989, this “rewatered” treatment received 171% ET c from 18 Aug. to 27 Sept. In 1990, it received 132% ET c from 1 Aug. to 10 Sept. Percentage of double fruit at thinning time was measured on 12 shoots per plot 1 month after bloom. Final numbers of doubles and deep sutures were determined by evaluating every fruit harvested in late May. Statistical analysis was run separately each year and consisted of standard analysis of variance and Duncan’s multiple range test (CoHort Software, Minneapolis, Minn.). Substantial water savings were achieved by reducing irrigation after harvest (Table 1); however, formation of double fruit was extensive (33% to 51%) and similar to levels reported from other studies (Garcia 1980; Johnson et al., 1992; Larson et al., 1988). Even after hand thinning, the stress treatment still had 3% to 4% doubles at harvest, vs. <1% for the control. In addition, deep sutures ranged from 10% to 15% of the harvested fruit in the stress treatment vs. 1% to 4% for the control. Close examination of developing fruit suggests deep sutures start as doubles, but early on one of the two fruit aborts and may not be evident at harvest (Fig. 1, top). However, its presence during early development interferes with proper suture closing of the other fruit. Thus, doubles and deep sutures are both the result of formation of two carpels, caused by water stress. Microscopic observation of 60 flower buds per week in 1988 showed no carpel differentiation on 24 Aug., 22% on 31 Aug., and 90% on 8 Sept., which is similar to other reports from California (Garcia, 1980). Double carpels were also observed at the same time (Fig. 1, bottom). Therefore, in 1989 the rewatered treatment was initiated on 18 Aug. in order to relieve stress by the first week of September. This significantly reduced doubling to ≈21%, but this level was still higher than desired. Accordingly, in 1990 rewatering was initiated on 1 Aug., which reduced doubles to the same level as that found in the fully irrigated control. Doubles and deep sutures at harvest were reduced to control levels in both years. Substantial water savings over the control were still achieved. These data support the conclusion that doubles and deep sutures in fruit from water-stressed peach trees can be reduced to control levels by relieving the stress shortly before and during carpel differentiation.","Walnut green husk is an agricultural waste produced during the walnut (Juglans regia L.) harvest, that could be valued as a source of high-value compounds. In this respect, walnut green husks from two areas of Southern Italy (Montalto Uffugo and Zumpano), with different soil conditions, were investigated. Glucans and pectins were isolated from dry walnut husks by carrying out alkaline and acidic extractions, respectively, and then they were characterized by FT-IR, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The colorimetric method for the enzymatic measurement of α- and β-glucans was performed. The maximum total glucan yield was recovered from Montalto walnut husks (4.6 ± 0.2 g/100 g DM) with a β-glucan percentage (6.3 ± 0.4) higher than that calculated for Zumpano walnut husks (3.6 ± 0.5). Thermal analysis (DSC) confirmed the higher degree of crystallinity of glucans from Zumpano. The pectin content for Montalto husks was found to be 2.6 times that of Zumpano husks, and the esterification degree was more than 65%. The results suggested that J. regia L. green husks could be a source of glucans and pectins, whose content and morphological and thermal characteristics were influenced by different soil and climate conditions.","The apple variety, ‘Honeycrisp’ has been extensively planted in North America during the last two decades. However, it suffers from several agronomic problems that limit productivity and postharvest quality. To reduce losses, new information is needed to better describe the impact of crop load on productivity and postharvest fruit quality in a desert environment and the major region where ‘Honeycrisp’ expansion is occurring. Here, 7-year-old ‘Honeycrisp’ trees on the M9Nic29 rootstock (2.53 0.9 m) were hand thinned to five different crop loads [from 4.7 to 16.0 fruit/cm of trunk cross-sectional area (TCSA)] to compare fruit quality, maturity, fruit size, elemental concentration, and return bloom. Fruit size distribution was affected by crop load. Trees with the highest crop load (16 fruit/cm) produced smaller fruit. Index of absorbance difference (IAD) measurements (absorption difference between 670 and 720 nm), a proxy indicator of the chlorophyll content below the skin of fruit measured by a DA-meter, were made shortly after harvest (T0) and after 6 months of storage (T1). Fruit from the trees with the lowest crop load had lower IAD values indicating advanced fruit ripeness. The comparison between the IAD classes at T0 and T1 showed that fruit belonging to the lowest IAD class had significantly higher redblushed overcolor percentage, firmness, dry matter, and soluble solid content than those in the ‘‘most unripe’’ class (highest IAD readings) regardless of crop load. The percentage of blushed color, firmness, titratable acidity (TA), soluble solids content, and dry matter were all higher in the lowest crop loads at both T0 and T1. Fruit calcium (Ca) concentration was lowest at the lowest crop load. The (K + Mg + N):Ca ratio decreased as crop load increased until a crop load of 11.3 fruit/cm, which was not significantly different from higher crop loads. For return bloom, the highest number of flower clusters per tree was reported for 4.7 fruit/cm crop load, and generally it decreased as crop load increased. Here, we highlight the corresponding changes in fruit quality, storability, and elemental balance with tree crop load. To maintain high fruit quality and consistency in yield, careful crop load management is required to minimize bienniality and improve fruit quality and storability. The apple variety, ‘Honeycrisp’, is a premium fresh fruit marketplace variety (Embree et al., 2007; Rosenberger et al., 2004) selected in Minnesota. As such, it is well adapted to northern climatic conditions (Luby and Bedford, 1990). ‘Honeycrisp’ is a profitable apple for growers and, for this reason, the acreage is expanding from cold to warmer areas (Nichols and Wright, 2003) including Washington State. Orchard management and the production of high quality for ‘Honeycrisp’ fruit can be challenging, especially in hot climate areas like Washington State. Washington’s climate varies greatly from west to east. In the Columbia Basin, one of the main area for apple production, the climate is semiarid (http://www.wrcc.dri. edu). Early fruit production before the trees have developed a complete canopy can permanently limit the final tree size and consequently, can impact future productivity (Castro et al., 2015). Crop load management is particularly important for ‘Honeycrisp’ because it can limit inconsistent annual flowering and fruit set (Embree et al., 2007), improve fruit quality (Baugher and Schupp, 2010), and decrease susceptibility to storage disorders (Robinson and Watkins, 2009). ‘Honeycrisp’ has exhibited an extreme predisposition to overcropping, therefore, is susceptible to biennial bearing (Crassweller et al., 2005; Embree and Nichols, 2005; Robinson and Watkins, 2003; Wright et al., 2006), especially when thinning is completed too late (Pellerin et al., 2011, 2012). Thinning is a common agronomical practice to optimize crop load to improve fruit size and quality as well as reducing biennial bearing (Dennis, 2000; Link, 2000; Wertheim, 2000). Thinning affects the cell number and fruit size (Bain and Robertson, 1951), and is considered effective within 4 to 12 weeks after full bloom, while its efficacy is cultivar dependent (Bergh, 1990; Denne, 1960). Both crop load and warmer climate conditions can affect the balance of nutrients in the fruits and leaves and, subsequently, affects postharvest fruit quality and postharvest susceptibility to storage disorders. Young ‘Honeycrisp’ orchards are susceptible to bitter pit and symptoms can appear before harvest or during storage (Rosenberger et al., 2004). High vegetative vigor can lead to transpiration imbalances and less Ca being allocated to the developing fruit (W€unsche and Ferguson, 2005). These effects may be further magnified in a hot, desert climate where transpiration pressures are greater. The amount of affected fruit can increase dramatically in situations of excessive vigor and/or low crop loads. Bitter pit is associated with low Ca concentration in fruit and the elemental balance between Ca, potassium (K), magnesium (Mg), and nitrogen (N). High concentrations of K, Mg, and N are associated with an increase in the percentage of fruit lost to bitter pit. Crop load has a strong effect on fruit size (Embree et al., 2007). Fruit size can also be influenced by low soil pH, boron deficiency, and environmental stress such as drought (Faust and Shear, 1968; Ferguson and Watkins, 1989; Rosenberger et al., 2004). Bangerth (1979) and W€unsche and Ferguson (2005) reported that larger fruit have lower Ca concentrations suggesting that high fruit growth rates in late stages of fruit development can lead to fruit Ca deficiencies. High crop loads can limit tree vigor and fruit size and can decrease the incidence of this physiological disorder. However, it is well known that a high crop load can reduce size, color appearance, lower flesh firmness, lower sugars, and acidity of fruits (Embree et al., 2007; Hampson and Kemp, 2003) in addition to return bloom the following year. Crop load can also affect the photosynthesis in apple tree (Palmer et al., 1997) and dry matter Received for publication 2 Oct. 2015. Accepted for publication 13 Jan. 2016.

The effect of crop load on ‘Honeycrisp’ postharvest quality has not been widely reported in Washington State. Here, the main objective was to determine the impact of different crop loads on fruit quality, storability, nutritional balance, and return of bloom in ‘Honeycrisp’ in a desert environment. Our hypothesis was that lower crop loads would promote more return bloom and increase fruit quality for ‘Honeycrisp’ grown in warmer climates. Additionally, our preliminary work indicated that a nondestructive approach using the DA-meter (Ziosi et al., 2008) can be used to predict quality attributes of pome fruit in storage. Additionally, we sought to further test the application of DA-meter for ‘Honeycrisp’ fruit maturity and storability assessments. Understanding the impact of tree crop load on mineral nutritional balance in combination with fruit quality, ripening, and storability can help to optimize tree management and better identify optimum crop loads suitable for ‘Honeycrisp’ grown in warmer climates. Materials and Methods Field conditions. The experimental field was located in Naches, WA (46 43#23.01##N, 120 40#26.07##W). Seven-year-old apple trees cv. Honeycrisp grafted on M9-NIC29 were trained to a vertical axis with a planting density of 2.5 · 0.9 m (4444 trees/ha). The orchard was watered with drip irrigation and mulched along the rows with coarse bark chips. Soil in the trial location was collected (at 20 cm from the trunk under the mulch) at two depths (0–30 and 30–60 cm) pooling together three rows. Soil was classified as a loam (U.S. Department of Agriculture texture) with 50% sand, 12% clay, and 38% silt in the first 30 cm of soil sampling, while 40% sand, 14% clay, and 46% silt in 30–60 cm depth. pH was 7.7 and 7.2 at the two depths, respectively, which is a little higher than conventional apple orchards in the same region of Washington (Glover et al., 2000). Soil analysis did not indicate abnormal nutrient or pH imbalances and fertility was managed with a combination of fertigation applied with drip irrigation and foliar treatments. Tree size was variable within the orchard. To limit the effect of tree-to-tree variation on fruit productivity and quality during tree sample selection, trunk cross-sectional area was measured for 40 trees that ranged from 5.2 to 10.0 cm (Supplemental Fig. 1). Fifteen homogeneous trees (average height 314 cm) were selected with a trunk cross-sectional area between 7 and 9 cm (measured at 15 cm from the grafting point). In 2014, full bloom in the experimental block occurred during the last week of April. At the end of June, sample trees were hand thinned to five different crop load targets; 30–40, 50–65, 75–85, 90–100, and 125–135 fruit/tree, which at harvest averaged 34, 56, 84, 95, and 130 fruit/tree, respectively. Converting to fruit/TCSA cm crop was equal to 4.7, 7.5, 11.3, 12.5, and 16.0 fruit/TCSA cm, from low to high crop loads described above, respectively. These were the actual number of fruit remaining on the tree at harvest and, therefore, crop loads were not evenly distributed between treatments. Fruit analysis. Fruit were harvested in a single picking (1 week before commercial harvest) on 28 Aug. 2014. The number of fruits and yield (kg/tree) were measured for each tree. Yield per tree and total number of fruit per tree were combined with trunk crosssectional area to calculate yield efficiency (kg/cm) and crop load (fruit/cm), respectively. Fruit from each tree was categorized into fruit size classes (<55, 55–59, 60–64, 65–69, 70","Season extension structures like high tunnels make it possible to produce coldtolerant crops during winter months for both a longer cropping season and a winter market season. The effects of location and planting date on the fresh yield of several cultivars of Asian greens (Brassica rapa L.), lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.), and spinach (Spinacia oleracea L.) were examined at Moscow, ID/Pullman, WA, and Vancouver, WA, a cold temperate climate and a mild marine climate, respectively. In Winter 2005–06, 20 cultivars were evaluated and in Winter 2006–07 a subset of 12 cultivars were evaluated. Location impacted yield, and higher yields overall were attained at Vancouver than at Moscow/Pullman, likely as a result of more consistent, warmer soil and air temperatures as well as increasing irradiance in February and March at Vancouver. Asian green cultivars had the highest overall yield resulting from faster growth compared with spinach and lettuce cultivars at both locations. Although most lettuce cultivars grew throughout the winter, further research is needed to identify the most suitable cultivars, seeding dates, and planting densities to optimize winter production of this crop and for Asian greens and spinach. Planting date influenced yields with the highest yields obtained for the third planting date for all trials except at Moscow/Pullman in the second year. Overall, this research suggests that it is possible to grow many cold-tolerant cultivars of Asian greens, spinach, and lettuce in a high tunnel during the winter months in both mild and cold temperate northern climates. High tunnels, also called hoophouses, are used worldwide to provide environmental control for raising horticultural crops (Lamont, 2009; Waterer, 2003; Wells and Loy, 1993). Protected cultivation with high tunnels is not as prevalent in the United States as it is in other parts of the world, but interest is growing rapidly for small-scale producers wanting earlier crop maturity and a longer season for sales at local markets (Carey et al., 2009). High tunnels are used primarily to minimize environmental effects on crop production either by extending the growing season in both spring and fall or providing protection from wind and rain in warmer months or climates (Lamont et al., 2003; Lang, 2009; Panter, 2007; Wein, 2006). High tunnels can modify the climate sufficiently to lengthen the growing season from 1 to 4 weeks in the spring and 2 to 8 weeks in the fall (Wells and Loy, 1993). Unlike traditional greenhouses, high tunnels do not have power for heat, lights, or fans, and crops are planted directly into the soil. Giacomelli (2009) describes thoroughly high tunnel design, construction, and environmental control. Many crops have been successfully cultivated in the United States and throughout the world in high tunnels, including vegetable crops (Carey et al., 2009; Lamont, 2009; Lamont et al., 2003; Waterer, 2003), small fruit (Demchak, 2009; Lamont et al., 2003), cut flowers (Lamont, 2009; Wien, 2009), and small-statured fruit trees (Lang, 2009). Benefits that high tunnels provide to horticultural crops include soil warming, reduced soil compaction, and often reduced diseases and insect pests (Demchak, 2009; Lamont et al., 2003; Lang, 2009). As a result, crop yield and quality can be improved when crops are grown in a high tunnel (Carey et al., 2009; Demchak, 2009; Lang, 2009; Waterer, 2003). Cultivar selection is an important consideration for winter production because crops must have tolerance to cold temperatures and freezing even in protected structures. Maynard and Hochmuth (2006) have classified many leafy green vegetables as cool season-hardy (cabbage, kale, mustard, spinach) or halfhardy (Chinese cabbage, lettuce). Information on optimum growing conditions is not available for all Asian greens (Brassica rapa L.) but Chinese cabbage grows best in moderate to cool temperatures (13 to 24 C; Bennett et al., 2010) and can tolerate frost (Cramer et al., 2006). The optimum temperature range for lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.) is 13 to 16 C but it can tolerate temperatures as low as –2 C without damage (Mansour and Raab, 1996). The optimum temperature is 17 C for spinach (Spinacia oleracea L.), but it can tolerate temperatures as low as –9 C without injury (Koike et al., 2011). Spinach may be grown in the open field where winters are mild by seeding in mid to late September (Mansour and Raab, 1996). The cold hardiness of Asian greens, lettuce, and spinach suggest they may be ideal for winter high tunnel cultivation in Washington State and may expand the market for leafy greens in the region and other areas with similar climatic conditions. The purpose of this study was to assess the yield of leafy green vegetables grown for a salad mix in a high tunnel during the winter in two climatically different locations in Washington and to characterize several environmental factors that may affect their yield. The specific objective was to examine the effects of location, crop type, and time of harvest on yield of cultivars included in this study. This information could provide growers an affordable opportunity to attain year-long local production. Materials and Methods Study locations. This experiment was conducted at two climatically different locations, with similar latitudes, east and west of the Cascade Mountains in Washington State. In 2005–06, the eastern field site was at Moscow, ID [lat. 46.73 N, long. 116.99 W; elevation 792 m (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, 2009)], which was only 13 km away from the 2006–07 field site at Pullman, WA [lat. 46.73 N, long. 117.17 W; elevation 779 m (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, 2009)]. The two field sites have similar winter weather and environmental conditions with an average temperature of –0.3 C, an average maximum temperature of 3.3 C, and an average minimum temperature of –3.8 C (December to February, 1960 to 2006; Office of the Washington State Climatologist, 2009). The soil type at the Moscow site is a Naff Fine-Silty, Mixed, Superactive, Mesic Typic Agrixeroll and at the Pullman site a Palouse Fine-Silty, Mixed, Superactive, Mesic Pachic Ultic Haploxeroll. The western field site was at Vancouver, WA [lat. 45.63 N, long. 122.67 W; elevation 50 m (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Received for publication 30 Aug. 2012.

The average winter temperature was 4.4 C, the average maximum temperature was 8.5 C, and the average minimum temperature was 0.4 C (December to February, 1960 to 2006; Office of the Washington State Climatologist, 2009). The soil type at the Vancouver location is a Hillsboro Fine-Silty, Mixed, Superactive, Mesic Ultic Agrixeroll. High tunnel structure. The high tunnels were 5 m wide and 15 m long (75 m) at Moscow, 6 m wide and 15 m long (90 m) at Pullman, and 5 m wide and 20 m long (100 m) at Vancouver. Each was covered with a single layer of 0.15-mm ultraviolet-treated greenhouse plastic and planting was directly in the soil. The end doors were opened during the daytime to ventilate the high tunnels on warm, sunny days and closed again at night when temperatures became cool. Trial dates and crop cultivars. Both years, all cultivars were started from seed in a greenhouse, and seeding dates were 2 weeks apart each year. Seedlings were transplanted at 6 weeks into the high tunnel (Table 1). In 2005–06, a total of 20 cultivars were seeded: eight Asian greens, 10 lettuce, and two spinach. ‘Mizuna’ was not included in the first planting at either location as a result of late arrival of seed, whereas Tat Soi and ‘Cardinale’ were not included at Vancouver as a result of lack of seed availability. In 2006–07, a subset of 12 cultivars was selected based on plant growth: four Asian greens, six lettuce, and two spinach. Each planting was in a separate bed in a high tunnel with four replicates arranged in a randomized complete block design. Each bed measured 1 m wide and 15 m long (15 m), and beds were spaced 1.5 m apart. In 2005–06, two plants of each cultivar were transplanted into an area of 20 cm 3 25 cm (500 cm) and in 2006–07, four plants of each cultivar were transplanted into an area of 40 cm 3 25 cm (1000 cm). Both years plant density was 40 plants/m. Fertility management. At all locations, compost was added to the beds at 10 kg·m wet weight and incorporated to a depth of 10 cm; incorporation was 3 to 4 weeks before the first planting the first year and 2 weeks before the first planting the second year. At Moscow, compost was 1.2% to 1.4% total nitrogen (N) with 25 carbon (C):1 N on a dry weight basis and at Pullman compost was 1.4% total N with 20 C:1 N. At Vancouver, compost was 0.9% to 1.1% total N with 22 to 30 C:1 N in 2005–06 and was 1.1% total N with a 19 C:1 N in 2006– 07. All compost samples were analyzed for C/N ratios by the University of Idaho Analytical Sciences Laboratory in Moscow, ID. At all locations in 2005–06, BioGro fish-fertilizer (7N–3.1P–1.7K; Bio-gro, Inc., Mabton, WA) was applied at a rate of 118 to 236 mL/plant and Acadian Seaplants seaweed extract (1N–0.44P–16.6K with trace minerals; Acadian Seaplants Limited, Nova Scotia, Canada) was applied at a rate of 12.5 mL/plant at transplanting and every 3 weeks thereafter. In 2006–07, BioLink (5N","Vitis labrusca grapes are widely cultivated in some countries such as Brazil and the United States, especially for juice production. ‘Isabel’ is one of the main cultivars because of its high production and disease tolerance, but the juice is deficient in color. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of timing and concentration of (S)-cisabscisic acid (S-ABA), a specific isomer of abscisic acid applied to ‘Isabel’ grapes, aiming to increase anthocyanin accumulation and to improve juice quality. The trial was conducted on two consecutive seasons (2011 and 2012) in a commercial vineyard located in Maringa, PR, Brazil. The vines were trained in an overhead trellis system and spaced at 4.0 3 1.0 m. The statistical model used was a randomized block design with four replications and five treatments: control; S-ABA at 200 mg·L at 7 days after veraison (DAV); S-ABA at 400 mg·L at 7 DAV; S-ABA at 200 mg·L at 7 DAV + 200 mg·L at 15 days after the first application (DAFA); and S-ABA at 400 mg·L at 7 DAV + 400 mg·L at 15 DAFA. There were no significant differences between treatments in relation to berry or cluster size or weight. S-ABA application resulted in increased anthocyanin concentrations in both berries and juices, mainly when 400 mg·L was applied. Sensory analysis also revealed the efficiency of this plant growth regulator to promote better acceptance of grape juices. Thus, a single application of S-ABA at 400 mg·L at 7 DAV is sufficient to increase the anthocyanins concentration of ‘Isabel’ grapes, improving the acceptance of juice by consumers. American grapes are widely cultivated in some areas of the world such as Brazil and the United States, mainly for grape juice production as well as for the fresh market. ‘Isabel’, syn. ‘Isabella’, grape (Vitis labrusca L.) is one of the most important American cultivars as a result of its high productivity and disease tolerance (Nixdorf and Hermosı́n-Gutiérrez, 2010). However, the juice obtained from this cultivar is deficient in color because of a lack of pigments, needing it to be blended with juices from other pigment-producing grapes. These pigment-producing cultivars, as a rule, are less productive than ‘Isabel’. For this reason, cultivation of ‘Isabel’ is preferred by grape growers because profits are related to the yield obtained in the vineyard (Camargo et al., 2010). Grapes with a more intense color are more appealing for juice and wine elaboration because dark-colored grapes usually have a higher content of phenolic compounds, which are substances containing an aromatic ring with one or more hydroxyl substituents and other functional groups. These phenolic compounds also have beneficial effects on human health by acting to neutralize free radicals (Orak, 2007; Rastija et al., 2009). The major phenolic compounds present in grapes are flavonoids (anthocyanins and flavonols), stilbene (resveratrol), phenolic acids (derivatives of cinnamic and benzoic acids), and a wide variety of tannins (Francis, 2000; Naczk and Shahidi, 2004). Among these compounds, anthocyanins are the plant pigments responsible for most of the blue and purple and all tones of red colors found in flowers, fruits and some leaves, stems, and roots of plants (Markakis, 1982). The amount and composition of this flavonoid in grapes differ according to species, cultivar, maturity, and climatic conditions (Segade et al., 2008). The accumulation of anthocyanins, which starts from veraison (the onset of grape ripening), is responsible for the intensity of the color of berries and appears to be regulated, at least in part, by abscisic acid (ABA) (Ban et al., 2003; Hiratsuka et al., 2001; Owen et al., 2009). Studies have shown that exogenous ABA treatment of hybrid grapes such as ‘Kyoho’ and ‘Olimpia’ (Vitis vinifera · V. labrusca) can increase skin anthocyanin concentrations (Han et al., 1996; Kataoka et al., 1982; Lee and Tomana, 1980; Matsushima et al., 1989). The high cost of ABA synthesis by chemical companies did not justify its use in agriculture (Cantı́n et al., 2007). Recently, a method has been developed for the biological production of S-ABA, a specific isomer of ABA, using the Botrytis cinerea fungus, making the production process economically viable for agricultural use (Owen et al., 2009; Siewers et al., 2006). Since then, the effects of S-ABA have been tested basically on V. vinifera table grapes (Peppi et al., 2007; Peppi and Fidelibus, 2008; Roberto et al., 2012, 2013), but the effect of this plant growth regulator on V. labrusca grapes with lack of pigmentation used for whole juice production was not known, especially those grown in warm climate areas. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of treatments consisting of different concentrations of S-ABA at different times over the final phase of ripening after veraison on ‘Isabel’ grape, aiming to increase the accumulation of anthocyanins in berry and juice. Materials and Methods Grapevines and growing conditions. This study was conducted in a commercial vineyard of own-rooted ‘Isabel’ grapes (Vitis labrusca L.) from 11-year-old vines belonging to the Intervin winery, located in Maringá, state of Paraná (PR), Brazil (lat. 23 25# S, long. 51 57# W, altitude 542 m), on two consecutive crop seasons, 2011 and 2012. According to the Köppen classification, the climate is type Cfa, i.e., subtropical climate with an average temperature in the coldest month below 18 C and average temperature in the warmest month above 22 C. The maximum temperature is 31 C and the average annual rainfall is 1596 mm with a tendency of concentrated rainfall in summer months. The vines were trained on overhead trellis and spaced 4.0 · 1.0 m apart. Pruning was performed to leave two to three buds per spur. Subsequently, 5% hydrogen cyanamide was applied to the buds to induce and standardize sprouting. During the trials, the standard regional cultivation practices with regard to nutrition, weed control, and pest and disease management were used. Received for publication 18 Dec. 2013.

To whom reprint requests should be addressed; e-mail sroberto@uel.br. 460 HORTSCIENCE VOL. 49(4) APRIL 2014 The effects of the plant growth regulator S-ABA applied at different concentrations and times on the grape clusters were evaluated. S-ABA, at an active concentration of 100 g·L, was supplied by Valent BioSciences Corporation (Libertyville, IL). Treatments and experimental design. The following treatments were tested: 1) control (no application); 2) S-ABA at 200 mg·L at 7 DAV; 3) S-ABA at 400 mg·L at 7 DAV; 4) S-ABA at 200 mg·L at 7 DAV + 200 mg·L at 15 DAFA; and 5) S-ABA at 400 mg·L at 7 DAV + 400 mg·L at 15 DAFA. The randomized blocks design was used as a statistical model with five treatments and four replicates with five vines per plot. Fifteen representative clusters in each plot were marked before the application of treatments for further evaluation. For treatment applications, clusters were sprayed in the morning using a knapsack sprayer at a pressure of 568.93 psi (39.22 bar) with JA1 hollow cone nozzle tips at a volume of 800 L·ha to provide complete and uniform coverage. In addition, 0.3 mL·L of Break-Thru (Evonik Industries, Germany), a non-ionic surfactant, was added to all treatments. Berry sampling and fruits analysis. In both crop seasons, clusters of each plot were manually harvested when soluble solids reached around 16 Brix. For each plot, 90 berries were collected for physicochemical analysis with two berries taken from the upper, middle, and bottom regions of each marked cluster. The physical characteristics of grapes were evaluated by determining the mass (g) and diameter (mm) of berries and the weight (g) and length (cm) of clusters using a scale and a digital caliper. Berry color was analyzed using a colorimeter Minolta CR-10 to obtain the following variables from the equatorial portion of berries (n = 2 per berry): L* (lightness), C* (chroma), and h (hue) (Cantı́n et al., 2007). Lightness values may range from 0 (black) to 100 (white). Chroma indicates the purity or intensity of color, the distance from gray (achromatic) toward a pure chromatic color, and is calculated from the a* and b* values of the CIELab scale system, starts from zero for a completely neutral color, and does not have an arbitrary end, but intensity increases with magnitude. Hue refers to the color wheel and is measured in angles; green, yellow, and red correspond to 180 , 90 , and 0 , respectively (Lancaster et al., 1997; MacGuire, 1992; Peppi et al., 2006). Grape juice production. Whole grape juices from treatment plots were produced by the Welch process (not from concentrate grape juice), which consists of extracting the juice by steam entrainment using a stainless steel extraction pot with a 7-kg capacity (Hauber Macanuda , PSM-07 CF) without any added enzyme (Borges et al., 2013). For this extraction, a sample of 4 kg of clusters from each plot was used, producing an average of 2 L of whole juice. At first, the bottom section of the steamer juicer pot was filled with water and the heat was turned on high. The 4-kg washed grape samples were placed in the top section of the steamer and the basket was filled all the way to the top, and the lid was put on. After 45 min, all grape juice was drained into the middle section of the steamer and then bottled at warm temperature (75 C) into sterilized polyethylene containers with lids and a capacity of 1 L. After cooling, juice bottles were stored in the refrigerator at 4 C for further anthocyanin, polyphenol, and sensory analyses. Anthocyanin extraction. The concentrations of total anthocyanins of berries and juices of all treatments were carried out according to Clemente and Galli (2013). For total anthocyanin extraction from berries, samples of 50 g of berries per plot were used. Samples were macerated and homogenized with 200 mL",15.946606232629,Low Water

This study aims to develop an early forecasting model of cereal yields (soft wheat, barley and durum wheat) at the scale of the agricultural province considering the 15 most productive over 2000–2017 (i.e., 15 × 18 = 270 yields values). To this objective, we built on previous works that showed a tight linkage between cereal yields and various datasets including weather data (rainfall and air temperature), regional climate indices (North Atlantic Oscillation in particular), and drought indices derived from satellite observations in different wavelengths. The combination of the latter three data sets is assessed to predict cereal yields using linear (Multiple Linear Regression, MLR) and non-linear (Support Vector Machine, SVM; Random Forest, RF, and eXtreme Gradient Boost, XGBoost) machine learning algorithms. The calibration of the algorithmic parameters of the different approaches are carried out using a 5-fold cross validation technique and a leave-one-out method is implemented for model validation. The statistical metrics of the models are first analyzed as a function of the input datasets that are used, and as a function of the lead times, from 4 months to 2 months before harvest. The results show that combining data from multiple sources outperformed models based on one dataset only. In addition, the satellite drought indices are a major source of information for cereal prediction when the forecasting is carried out close to harvest (2 months before), while weather data and, to a lesser extent, climate indices, are key variables for earlier predictions. The best models can accurately predict yield in January (4 months before harvest) with an R2 = 0.88 and RMSE around 0.22 t. ha−1. The XGBoost method exhibited the best metrics. Finally, training a specific model separately for each group of provinces, instead of one global model, improved the prediction performance by reducing the RMSE by 10% to 35% depending on the provinces. In conclusion, the results of this study pointed out that combining remote sensing drought indices with climate and weather variables using a machine learning technique is a promising approach for cereal yield forecasting.","This study provides an understanding for the relationship between climatic factors and sugarcane productivity in India. The main objective of this paper is to estimates the impact of climatic and non-climatic factors on sugarcane productivity. To check the consistency of empirical results, simple linear regression model, Ricardian productivity regression (non-linear) model and Cobb-Douglas production function models are employed. The data set incorporates 390 observations corresponding to thirteen states with panel data for 30 years during 1980 to 2009. These all models include sugarcane productivity as dependent variable. Irrigated area, agriculture labour, consumption of fertilizers, literacy rate, tractors and farm harvest price (at constant level) are considered as explanatory variables. Average rainfall, average maximum and average minimum temperature include as climatic factors to capture the effect of climatic conditions on cane productivity. These climatic factors are incorporate for three weather seasons such as rainy, winter and summer. Empirical results based on Prais Winsten models with panels corrected standard errors (PCSEs) estimation shows that climatic factors i.e. actual rainfall, average maximum and average minimum temperature have a statistically significant impact on sugarcane productivity. The climatic effect for various factors on cane productivity are varies within different seasons. Average maximum temperature in summer and average minimum temperature in rainy season have a negative and statistically significant effect on sugarcane productivity. While, sugarcane productivity positively get affect with increasing average maximum temperature in rainy season and winter seasons. The study concluded that there is non-linear relationship between climatic factors and sugarcane productivity in India.","Quantifying the influence of weather on yield variability is decisive for agricultural management under current and future climate anomalies. We extended an existing semiempirical modeling scheme that allows for such quantification. Yield anomalies, measured as interannual differences, were modeled for maize, soybeans, and wheat in the United States and 32 other main producer countries. We used two yield data sets, one derived from reported yields and the other from a global yield data set deduced from remote sensing. We assessed the capacity of the model to forecast yields within the growing season. In the United States, our model can explain at least two‐thirds (63%–81%) of observed yield anomalies. Its out‐of‐sample performance (34%–55%) suggests a robust yield projection capacity when applied to unknown weather. Out‐of‐sample performance is lower when using remote sensing‐derived yield data. The share of weather‐driven yield fluctuation varies spatially, and estimated coefficients agree with expectations. Globally, the explained variance in yield anomalies based on the remote sensing data set is similar to the United States (71%–84%). But the out‐of‐sample performance is lower (15%–42%). The performance discrepancy is likely due to shortcomings of the remote sensing yield data as it diminishes when using reported yield anomalies instead. Our model allows for robust forecasting of yields up to 2 months before harvest for several main producer countries. An additional experiment suggests moderate yield losses under mean warming, assuming no major changes in temperature extremes. We conclude that our model can detect weather influences on yield anomalies and project yields with unknown weather. It requires only monthly input data and has a low computational demand. Its within‐season yield forecasting capacity provides a basis for practical applications like local adaptation planning. Our study underlines high‐quality yield monitoring and statistics as critical prerequisites to guide adaptation under climate change.","Aim Recent changes in crop yields have implications for future global food security, which are likely to be affected by climate change. We developed a spatially explicit global dataset of historical yields for maize, soybean, rice and wheat to explore the historical changes in mean, year-to-year variation and annual rate of change in yields for the period 1982–2006. Location This study was conducted at the global scale. Methods We modelled historical and spatial patterns of yields at a grid size of 1.125° by combining global agricultural datasets related to the crop calendar and harvested area in 2000, country yield statistics and satellite-derived net primary production. Modelled yields were compared with other global datasets of yields in 2000 (M3-Crops and MapSPAM) and subnational yield statistics for 23 major crop-producing countries. Historical changes in modelled yields were then examined. Results Modelled yields explained 45–81% of the spatial variation of yields in 2000 from M3-Crops and MapSPAM, with root-mean-square errors of 0.5–1.8 t ha−1. Most correlation coefficients between modelled yield time series and subnational yield statistics for the period 1982–2006 in major crop-producing regions were greater than 0.8. Our analysis corroborated the incidence of reported yield stagnations and collapses and showed that low and mid latitudes in the Southern Hemisphere (0–40°S) experienced significantly increased year-to-year variation in maize, rice and wheat yields in 1994–2006 compared with that in 1982–93. Main conclusions Our analyses revealed increased instability of yields across a broad region of the Southern Hemisphere, where many developing countries are located. Such changes are likely to be related to recent yield stagnation and collapses. Although our understanding of the impacts of recent climate change, particularly the incidence of climate extremes, on crop yields remains limited, our dataset offers opportunities to close parts of this knowledge gap.","Studies show that climate variability drives interannual changes in meteorological variables in Europe, which directly or indirectly impacts crop production. However, there is no climate-based decision model that uses indices of atmospheric oscillation to predict agricultural production risks in Europe on multiple time-scales during the growing season. We used Fast-and-Frugal trees to predict sugar beet production, applying five large-scale indices of atmospheric oscillation: El Niño Southern Oscillation, North Atlantic Oscillation, Scandinavian Pattern, East Atlantic Pattern, and East Atlantic/West Russian pattern. We found that Fast-and-Frugal trees predicted high/low sugar beet production events in 77% of the investigated regions, corresponding to 81% of total European sugar beet production. For nearly half of these regions, high/low production could be predicted six or five months before the start of the sugar beet harvesting season, which represents approximately 44% of the mean annual sugar beet produced in all investigated areas. Providing early warning of crop production shortages/excess allows decision makers to prepare in advance. Therefore, the use of the indices of climate variability to forecast crop production is a promising tool to strengthen European agricultural climate resilience.","With the rising demand for food products and the direct impact of climate change on food production in many parts of the world, recent years have seen growing interest in the subject of food security and the role of rainfed farming in this area. Machine learning methods can be used to predict crop yield based on a combination of remote sensing data and data collected by ground weather stations. This paper argues that forecasting drylands farming yield can be reliable for management purpose under uncertain conditions using machine learning methods and remote sensing data and determines which indicators are most important in predicting the yield of chickpea. In this study, the yield of rainfed chickpea farms in 11 top chickpea producing counties in Kermanshah province, Iran, was predicted using three machine learning methods, namely support vector regression (SVR), random forest (RF), and K-nearest neighbors (KNN). To improve prediction accuracy, for each county, remote sensing data were overlaid by the satellite images of rainfed farms with a suitable slope and altitude for rainfed farming. An integrated database was created by combining weather data, remote sensing data, and chickpea yield statistics. The methods were evaluated using the leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) technique and compared in terms of multiple measures. Given the sensitivity of rainfed chickpea yield to the time of data, the predictions were made in two scenarios: (1) using the averages of the data of all growing months, and (2) using the data of a combination of months. The results showed that RF provides more accurate yield predictions than other methods. The predictions of this method were 7–8% different from the statistics reported by the Statistical Center and the Ministry of Agriculture of Iran. It was found that for pre-harvest prediction of rainfed chickpea yield, using the data of the March–April period (the averages of two months) offers the best result in terms of the correlation coefficient for the relationship between the yield and the predictor indices.","Long-term warming trends across the globe have shifted the distribution of temperature variability, such that what was once classified as extreme heat relative to local mean conditions has become more common. This is also true for agricultural regions, where exposure to extreme heat, particularly during key growth phases such as the reproductive period, can severely damage crop production in ways that are not captured by most crop models. Here, we analyze exposure of crops to physiologically critical temperatures in the reproductive stage (Tcrit), across the global harvested areas of maize, rice, soybean and wheat. Trends for the 1980–2011 period show a relatively weak correspondence (r = 0.19) between mean growing season temperature and Tcrit exposure trends, emphasizing the importance of separate analyses for Tcrit. Increasing Tcrit exposure in the past few decades is apparent for wheat in Central and South Asia and South America, and for maize in many diverse locations across the globe. Maize had the highest percentage (15%) of global harvested area exposed to at least five reproductive days over Tcrit in the 2000s, although this value is somewhat sensitive to the exact temperature used for the threshold. While there was relatively little sustained exposure to reproductive days over Tcrit for the other crops in the past few decades, all show increases with future warming. Using projections from climate models we estimate that by the 2030s, 31, 16, and 11% respectively of maize, rice, and wheat global harvested area will be exposed to at least five reproductive days over Tcrit in a typical year, with soybean much less affected. Both maize and rice exhibit non-linear increases with time, with total area exposed for rice projected to grow from 8% in the 2000s to 27% by the 2050s, and maize from 15 to 44% over the same period. While faster development should lead to earlier flowering, which would reduce reproductive extreme heat exposure for wheat on a global basis, this would have little impact for the other crops. Therefore, regardless of the impact of other global change factors (such as increasing atmospheric CO2), reproductive extreme heat exposure will pose risks for global crop production without adaptive measures such as changes in sowing dates, crop and variety switching, expansion of irrigation, and agricultural expansion into cooler areas.","Subseasonal-to-seasonal (S2S) prediction of winter wheat yields is crucial for farmers and decision-makers to reduce yield losses and ensure food security. Recently, numerous researchers have utilized machine learning (ML) methods to predict crop yield, using observational climate variables and satellite data. Meanwhile, some studies also illustrated the potential of state-of-the-art dynamical atmospheric prediction in crop yield forecasting. However, the potential of coupling both methods has not been fully explored. Herein, we aimed to establish a skilled ML–dynamical hybrid model for crop yield forecasting (MHCF v1.0), which hybridizes ML and a global dynamical atmospheric prediction system, and applied it to northern China at the S2S time scale. In this study, we adopted three mainstream machining learning algorithms (XGBoost, RF, and SVR) and the multiple linear regression (MLR) model, and three major datasets, including satellite data from MOD13C1, observational climate data from CRU, and S2S atmospheric prediction data from IAP CAS, used to predict winter wheat yield from 2005 to 2014, at the grid level. We found that, among the four models examined in this work, XGBoost reached the highest skill with the S2S prediction as inputs, scoring R2 of 0.85 and RMSE of 0.78 t/ha 3–4 months, leading the winter wheat harvest. Moreover, the results demonstrated that crop yield forecasting with S2S dynamical predictions generally outperforms that with observational climate data. Our findings highlighted that the coupling of ML and S2S dynamical atmospheric prediction provided a useful tool for yield forecasting, which could guide agricultural practices, policy-making and agricultural insurance.","Wheat is one of the main crops in China, and crop yield prediction is important for regional trade and national food security. There are increasing concerns with respect to how to integrate multi-source data and employ machine learning techniques to establish a simple, timely, and accurate crop yield prediction model at an administrative unit. Many previous studies were mainly focused on the whole crop growth period through expensive manual surveys, remote sensing, or climate data. However, the effect of selecting different time window on yield prediction was still unknown. Thus, we separated the whole growth period into four time windows and assessed their corresponding predictive ability by taking the major winter wheat production regions of China as an example in the study. Firstly we developed a modeling framework to integrate climate data, remote sensing data and soil data to predict winter wheat yield based on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. The results show that the models can accurately predict yield 1~2 months before the harvesting dates at the county level in China with an R2 > 0.75 and yield error less than 10%. Support vector machine (SVM), Gaussian process regression (GPR), and random forest (RF) represent the top three best methods for predicting yields among the eight typical machine learning models tested in this study. In addition, we also found that different agricultural zones and temporal training settings affect prediction accuracy. The three models perform better as more winter wheat growing season information becomes available. Our findings highlight a potentially powerful tool to predict yield using multiple-source data and machine learning in other regions and for crops.","Extreme weather disasters (EWDs) can jeopardize domestic food supply and disrupt commodity markets. However, historical impacts on European crop production associated with droughts, heatwaves, floods, and cold waves are not well understood—especially in view of potential adverse trends in the severity of impacts due to climate change. Here, we combine observational agricultural data (FAOSTAT) with an extreme weather disaster database (EM-DAT) between 1961 and 2018 to evaluate European crop production responses to EWD. Using a compositing approach (superposed epoch analysis), we show that historical droughts and heatwaves reduced European cereal yields on average by 9% and 7.3%, respectively, associated with a wide range of responses (inter-quartile range +2% to −23%; +2% to −17%). Non-cereal yields declined by 3.8% and 3.1% during the same set of events. Cold waves led to cereal and non-cereal yield declines by 1.3% and 2.6%, while flood impacts were marginal and not statistically significant. Production losses are largely driven by yield declines, with no significant changes in harvested area. While all four event frequencies significantly increased over time, the severity of heatwave and drought impacts on crop production roughly tripled over the last 50 years, from −2.2% (1964–1990) to −7.3% (1991–2015). Drought-related cereal production losses are shown to intensify by more than 3% yr−1. Both the trend in frequency and severity can possibly be explained by changes in the vulnerability of the exposed system and underlying climate change impacts.",21.9556384886083,Temperature Increase

These interactions may be negative such as the host-pathogen interactions leading to the disease development in plants or positive likes the interaction of the plants with the beneficial soil microbiota for stimulating the plant growth, conferring biotic, and abiotic stress tolerance in plants and helping the plants for the revitalization of contaminated and degraded soils (Abhilash et al., 2012). Apart from that, the beneficial microorganisms influence the resource allocation between root and shoot, biodiversity and also mediate the above-ground below ground interactions with herbivores and other natural enemies of the plants. Moreover, such dialogues between plant and microbes can modify the chemical, physical, and biochemical properties of the soil. The root exudate secreted by the plant allocates carbon and nutrients to the soil in the form of low molecular weight sugars, amino acids, and organic acids, polymerized sugars (e.g., mucilage), root border cells and dead root cap cells. Plant secretes phytosiderophores that help in sequestration of metallic micronutrients from the soil. Root exudates also contains secondary metabolites which help in the communication of plant and microbes. However, these interactions are intriguingly complex and dynamic and quite difficult to decipher as they takes places at different interfaces such as rhizosphere, phyllosphere, and endosphere. Therefore, a deep understanding of the interwoven processes taking place at the above interfaces is essential for disentangling the contribution of the each and every player for the ecosystem wellbeing. Thus, it is imperative to understand the key processes of the plant-microbe interactions in relation to assessing the contribution of the plant associated microorganisms to sustainable agriculture, ecosystem restoration, biomass and bioenergy production and mitigating the adverse impacts of climate change (Saleem and Moe, 2014). In this context, the book “Principles of Plant-Microbe Interactions: Microbes for Sustainable Agriculture,” edited by Ben Lugtenberg (2015) is a topical and timely contribution on plant-microbe interactions and offers a great hope for harnessing such beneficial interactions for making agriculture as a sustainable enterprise. Though literature provides ample information on plant-microbe interactions, the current book is first of its kind to discuss not only the interactions of microbes with plants but also the interactions of other important but often ignored players such as nematodes, insects, and pests. The book also discusses various ecological, economic and social aspects related to the plant-microbe based packages right from exploiting the symbiotic relationship to the development of genetically modified organisms for enhancing the sustainability of agriculture. The editor did his level best to incorporating the views of leading scientists and industrial professionals working in the concerned area to give a complete package to students, teachers, academicians, policy makers, young entrepreneurs, biotech, and food industry specialists and policy makers for understanding the plant-microbe interactions and successful exploitation for the benefit of the society. Moreover, the simple and lucid presentation of the crosstalk between microbes and the plants taking place at different interface is good enough to quenches the thirst of the readers from basic to applied and advanced molecular developments in the area. The editor meticulously divided the book into eight parts for detailing the fundaments of plant-microbe interactions to the application level such as (i) the elucidation of the microbial diversity associated with the plant system and its specific role (ii) the diversity of the phytopathogens, pests mediated crop damage, plant defense, and dilemma about the transgenic crops in public (iii) role of biocontrol agents and transgenics in plant disease resistance and post-harvest loss (vi) mechanism of different plant growth promoting microorganism and arbuscular mycorrhizae in host plant nutrients, water use efficiency and rhizoremediation (v) merit and the challenges in recent techniques like culture independent molecular tools and confocal microscopy for unraveling the rhizosphere microbiome and its interaction with the host plant (vi) the commercialization of microbial inoculum for the plant growth and disease control (vii) harnessing of plant-microbe interactions as a low-input biotechnology and finally (viii) manipulating the plant-microbe interactions for human wellbeing. The book starts with the fundamentals of the plant-microbe interactions by unraveling the rhizospheric, phyllospheric, and endospheric microbial world associated with the plant system. The book helps in exploring the diverse microbial partners, its importance's and mechanisms of the actions for proper understanding of the topic. It also elucidates the structural and functional details of microbial cell surfaces and its role in exchanging the signals from the exterior to the intracellular milieu. Interestingly, the book also exploring the role of myriad phytopathogens such as bacteria, fungi, nematodes, viruses, and pests its symptomatology, infections mechanisms along with plant immune response to infections and disease control mediated by the biocontrol agents. Apart from the biocontrol activity, the editor has also made an attempt to address the role of the plant associated microbiome for solubilizing the essential nutrients in soil and also for promoting the plant growth and yields even under adverse environmental conditions. The book also reminds that certain modifications in the microbial traits and rhizosphere environment will enhance the productivity of the agroecosystems. Importantly, the students and restoration workers will get in depth knowledge about various strategies for reshaping the rhizosphere microbiome. Similarly, transferring the genetic machinery of the nitrogen fixation in to non-legume plants also provides new vistas in sustainable agriculture. The book also unveil the concepts and issues related with the formulation, efficacy testing based on the European Plant Protection Organization, process of registration, and the global commercialization of the microbial inoculums in detail. The major global producers of the microbial inoculums are also detailed in this book. Although microbes like Pseudomonas sp., Bacillus sp., and Trichoderma sp. are the most suitable bio-inoculants, there are always outstanding concerns regarding the shell-life and field performance of these inoculums. Interestingly, the Editor has paid attention to detail the next generation ideal bioinoculants with the concepts of the enhanced stability, carrier suitability, spore forming capability, better inoculation strategies, seed–soil inoculation, microbial inoculants consortium application including bacteria, and fungi. It has been generally postulated that under changing climatic conditions, the increasing atmospheric CO2 will have a fertilization effect on plants and will increase the allocation of nutrients in above- and belowground parts. Hence, it is unclear that how such change will go to affect the plant-microbe interactions at ecosystem level (Abhilash and Dubey, 2014). Although such changing conditions will have a significant impact on plant-microbe interactions, the present book does not shed light on this important issue. Similarly, the exploitation of plant-microbe interactions for the clean-up of contaminated soils has been presented in accordance to the clean-up of organic pollutants with little emphasis on heavy metal and mixed pollutants (organic and inorganic) contaminated soil. Furthermore, in a time when next generation sequencing technologies have been completely revolutionized the microbial community analysis, the current book describes the microbial community analysis mainly on the basis of Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis. Nevertheless, we enjoyed reading this book as the editor tried to cover almost all fundamental and applied aspects of the plant-microbe interactions. As a final word, the book can be described as a book for all.","For most of the half century that aflatoxigenic species have been intensively studied, these molds were known only to reproduce asexually, with parasexuality found only in the laboratory between certain mutant strains. Therefore, the fairly recent discovery of their sexual (teleomorphic) states creates a new wrinkle in our understanding of the field behavior of these agriculturally significant fungi. Sex within populations of these fungi, and attendant genetic recombination, eventually may create difficulties for their control; and subsequently for the protection of important human and animal food supplies. Moreover, if fungal sex is a form of response to ecological and environmental stressors, then perhaps human influence and climate change could accelerate this phenomenon. This article will explore scientific research into sexuality and recombination in aflatoxigenic Aspergillus species; the potential impacts these phenomena could have on a popular method of pre-harvest prevention of aflatoxin contamination (i.e., use of non-aflatoxigenic A. flavus for biocontrol); and the outlook for maintaining control of aflatoxin contamination in an era of changing global climate.","Pest insects can damage agricultural crops, consume and/or damage harvested food, or transmit diseases to humans and animals. The past 30 years has witnessed a dramatic reemergence of epidemic vector-borne diseases throughout much of the world (Atkinson, 2010). Prior to the development and commercial success of synthetic insecticides in the mid1930s to 1950s, botanical insecticides were the foremost weapons against insect pests. The synthetic insecticides (organochlorines, organophosphates, carbamates and later the pyrethroids and neonicotinoids) are characterized by efficacy, speed of action, ease of use, and low cost. Accordingly, they drove many natural control methods, such as using of botanicals, predators, and parasitoids to near obscurity. Twenty years after synthetic insecticides were overzealously entrenched in ‘modern’ agricultural production; they induce widespread environmental contamination, toxicity to non-target organisms, development of resistance against insecticides, and negative effects on animal and human health (Pretty, 2009). Consequently, there is an urgent need to explore and utilize naturally occurring products for combating pests. The terms “biorational pesticide” and “biopesticides” are gaining popularity in the current climate of environmental awareness and public concern. Both terms are derived from two words, “biological” and “rational”, referring to pesticides that have limited or no adverse effects on the environment, nontarget organisms including humans. Biorational insecticides include: biochemicals insecticides (botanicals, insect growth regulators, insect pheromones, photoinsecticides, and inorganics); biological insecticides, using of natural enemies such as parasitoids, predators, nematodes, and pathogens (virus, bacteria, fungi, or protozoa); and transgenic insecticides (genetically modified plants or organisms). Natural enemies play an important role in limiting potential pest populations and they are more likely to survive in case of application of ecofriendly biopesticides. Approaches to the biological control of insects include: conservation of existing natural enemies; introducing new natural enemies and establishing a permanent population (called “classical biological control”); and mass rearing and periodic release, either as a seasonal introduction of a small population of natural enemies, or a massive, “inundative” release. In developing countries, biopesticides offer unique and challenging opportunities for exploration and development of their own biorational insecticides. Nanotechnology has become one of the most promising","Plant diseases are globally causing substantial losses in staple crop production, undermining the urgent goal of a 60% increase needed to meet the food demand, a task made more challenging by the climate changes. Main consequences concern the reduction of food amount and quality. Crop diseases also compromise food safety due to the presence of pesticides and/or toxins. Nowadays, biotechnology represents our best resource both for protecting crop yield and for a science-based increased sustainability in agriculture. Over the last decades, agricultural biotechnologies have made important progress based on the diffusion of new, fast and efficient technologies, offering a broad spectrum of options for understanding plant molecular mechanisms and breeding. This knowledge is accelerating the identification of key resistance traits to be rapidly and efficiently transferred and applied in crop breeding programs. This review gathers examples of how disease resistance may be implemented in cereals by exploiting a combination of basic research derived knowledge with fast and precise genetic engineering techniques. Priming and/or boosting the immune system in crops represent a sustainable, rapid and effective way to save part of the global harvest currently lost to diseases and to prevent food contamination.","The saprophytic yeast-like fungus Aureobasidium pullulans has been well documented for over 60 years in the microbiological literature. It is ubiquitous in distribution, being found in a variety of environments (plant surfaces, soil, water, rock surfaces and manmade surfaces), and with a worldwide distribution from cold to warm climates and wet/humid regions to arid ones. Isolates and strains of A. pullulans produce a wide range of natural products well documented in the international literature and which have been regarded as safe for biotechnological and environmental applications. Showing antagonistic activity against plant pathogens (especially post-harvest pathogens) is one of the major applications currently in agriculture of the fungus, with nutrient and space competition, production of volatile organic compounds, and production of hydrolytic enzymes and antimicrobial compounds (antibacterial and antifungal). The fungus also shows a positive role on mycotoxin biocontrol through various modes, with the most striking being that of binding and/or absorption. A. pullulans strains have been reported to produce very useful industrial enzymes, such as β-glucosidase, amylases, cellulases, lipases, proteases, xylanases and mannanases. Pullulan (poly-α-1,6-maltotriose biopolymer) is an A. pullulans trademark product with significant properties and biotechnological applications in the food, cosmetic and pharmaceutical industries. Poly (β-l-malic acid), or PMA, which is a natural biopolyester, and liamocins, a group of produced heavy oils and siderophores, are among other valuable compounds detected that are of possible biotechnological use. The fungus also shows a potential single-cell protein source capacity with high levels of nucleic acid components and essential amino acids, but this remains to be further explored. Last but not least, the fungus has shown very good biocontrol against aerial plant pathogens. All these properties are of major interest in the vitivinicultural sector and are thoroughly reviewed under this prism, concluding on the importance that A. pullulans may have if used at both vineyard and winery levels. This extensive array of properties provides excellent tools for the viticulturist/farmer as well as for the oenologist to combat problems in the field and create a high-quality wine.","The popularity in the consumption of fresh and fresh‐cut vegetables continues to increase globally. Fresh vegetables are an integral part of a healthy diet, providing vitamins, minerals, antioxidants and other health‐promoting compounds. The diversity of fresh vegetables and packaging formats (spring mix in clamshell container, bagged heads of lettuce) support increased consumption. Unfortunately, vegetable production and processing practices are not sufficient to ensure complete microbial safety. This review highlights a few specific areas that require greater attention and research. Selected outbreaks are presented to emphasize the need for science‐based ‘best practices’. Laboratory and field studies have focused on inactivation of pathogens associated with manure in liquid, slurry or solid forms. As production practices change, other forms and types of soil amendments are being used more prevalently. Information regarding the microbial safety of fish emulsion and pellet form of manure is limited. The topic of global climate change is controversial, but the potential effect on agriculture cannot be ignored. Changes in temperature, precipitation, humidity and wind can impact crops and the microorganisms that are associated with production environments. Climate change could potentially enhance the ability of pathogens to survive and persist in soil, water and crops, increasing human health risks. Limited research has focused on the prevalence and behaviour of viruses in pre and post‐harvest environments and on vegetable commodities. Globally, viruses are a major cause of foodborne illnesses, but are seldom tested for in soil, soil amendments, manure and crops. Greater attention must also be given to the improvement in the microbial quality of seeds used in sprout production. Human pathogens associated with seeds can result in contamination of sprouts intended for human consumption, even when all appropriate ‘best practices’ are used by sprout growers.","The nature of wildlife management throughout the world is changing. The increase in the world’s human population has been accompanied by a rapid expansion of agricultural and urban areas and infrastructures, especially road and railway networks. Worldwide, wildlife habitats are being transformed and fragmented by human activities, and the behavior of several species has changed as a result of human activities. Some species have adapted easily to urban or peri–urban habitats and take advantage of the new resources available. These data provide the context for why human–wildlife interactions are increasing. At the 30th International Union of Game Biologists Congress held in Barcelona in early September 2011, in addition to two plenary presentations, 52 authors from 12 different countries and three continents presented 15 papers in the Interactions of Humans and Wildlife Session, three of which are included in this volume. To some extent, all the papers reflected the inherent difficulty in solving the complex problems caused either by rapidly increasing species that begin to inhabit urban and agricultural areas in numbers not seen previously (e.g. coyotes, Canis latrans, inhabiting big cities; wild boar, Sus scrofa, across western Europe; wood pigeons, Columba palumbus, in France), or species whose populations are threatened by human activities (e.g., Eurasian Lynx, Lynx lynx, in the Czech Republic). Some papers addressed the contentious issue of predator control (e.g., gamebirds in Great Britain), while others presented data regarding how human activities influenced animal behavior (e.g., pink footed geese, Anser brachyrhynchus; and red deer, Cervus elaphus, in Germany). The papers presented at the congress show how human activities affect the distributions and dynamics of wildlife populations and also change the behavior of some species. Wildlife causes social and economic conflicts by damaging agricultural and forest resources, bringing about traffic collisions, and creating problems for residents in urban areas; while many are increasingly distant from nature and may not accept the presence of wildlife others may actively encourage the presence of wild animals. The first paper in this volume, by Cahill et al. (2012), analyzes the management challenges of the increasing abundance of wild boar in the peri–urban area of Barcelona. This conflict has arisen in other large cities in Europe and elsewhere. The presence of the species causes problems for many residents, to such an extent that it is considered a pest in these areas. Wild boar habituation has not only been facilitated by population expansion, but also by the attitudes of some citizens who encourage their presence by direct feeding. This leads to wild boar behavior modification and also promotes an increase in the fertility rate of habituated females, which are significantly heavier than non–habituated females. Public attitudes regarding the species and harvesting methods (at present most specimens are removed by live capture and subsequently sacrificed) are highlighted as one of the key factors in the management of the conflict. The second paper provides an example of how the distribution of irrigated croplands influences wild boar roadkills in NW Spain (Colino–Rabanal et al., 2012). By modeling the spatial distribution of wild boar collisions with vehicles and using generalized additive models based on GIS, the authors show that the number of roadkills is higher in maize croplands than in forested areas. This factor is the main explanatory variable in the model. The paper provides an excellent example of how the synergies of diverse human elements in the landscape (maize croplands and roads in this case) affect the location and dimensions of these types of conflicts. The third and final paper, by Belotti et al. (2012), addresses the effects of tourism on Eurasian lynx movements and prey usage at Sumava National Park in the Czech Republic. The monitoring of 5 GPS–collared lynxes and analyses of data regarding habitat features suggests that human disturbance (proximity of roads and tourist trails) can modify the presence of lynxes during the day close to the site where they have hidden a prey item, such as an ungulate, that can provide them with food for several days. In such cases, adequate management of tourism development must involve a commitment to species conservation. The analyses and understanding of all these phenomena and the design of successful wildlife management strategies and techniques used to mitigate the conflicts require a good knowledge base that considers information both about wildlife and human attitudes. The papers presented stress the importance of spatial analyses of the interactions and their relationship with landscape features and the location of human activities. Species distribution and abundance are related to important habitat variables such as provision of shelter, food, comfortable spaces, and an appropriate climate. Therefore, it is essential to analyze these data adequately to predict where conflicts are most likely to arise and to design successful mitigation strategies. The second key factor for adequate management of human–wildlife interactions is to monitor system change. An analysis of the variety of data on population dynamics, hunting, wildlife collisions, and wildlife presence in urban areas would provide a basis for adaptive management. In this respect, in the plenary session, Steve Redpath mentioned the importance of the wildlife biologist’s attitude when interpreting and drawing conclusions from recorded data and stressed the importance of conducting clear, relevant, and transparent science for participants involved in the management decision process, which often involves a high number of stakeholders. All of the papers addressing the problems associated with human wildlife interactions were characterized by a common theme. Regardless of the specific nature of the problem, the public was generally divided on how the problem should be addressed. A particularly sensitive theme was that of population control methods, especially when conflicts are located in peri–urban areas. Several presenters acknowledged that public participation was necessary if a solution was to be reached. Some suggested, as have other authors (Heydon et al., 2010), that a legislative framework may be needed to reconcile human and wildlife interests. However, each problem that was presented appeared to involve multiple stakeholders with different opinions. Solving these kinds of problems is not trivial. Social factors strongly influence perceptions of human–wildlife conflicts but the methods used to mitigate these conflicts often take into account technical aspects but not people’s attitudes. A new, more innovative and interdisciplinary approach to mitigation is needed to allow us 'to move from conflict towards coexistence' (Dickman, 2010). Other authors also mentioned the importance of planning interventions that optimize the participation of experts, policy makers, and affected communities and include the explicit, systematic, and participatory evaluation of the costs and benefits of alternative interventions (Treves et al., 2009). One technique that has been used to solve problems like these is termed Structured Decision Making (SDM). This technique was developed by the U.S. Geological Survey and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. As described by Runge et al. (2009), the process is 'a formal application of common sense for situations too complex for the informal use of common sense', and provides a rational framework and techniques to aid in prescriptive decision making. Fundamentally, the process entails defining a problem, deciding upon the objectives, considering the alternative actions and the consequences for each, using the available science to develop a model (the plan), and then making the decision how to implement (Runge et al., 2009). Although complex, SDM uses a facilitator to guide stakeholders through the process to reach a mutually agreed–upon plan of action. It is clear that human–wildlife interactions are inherently complex because many stakeholders are usually involved. A rational approach that incorporates all interested parties would seem to be a productive way of solving these kinds of problems.

Production of these toxic secondary metabolites is closely related to fungal development (Keller et al., 2005; Jamali et al., 2012). Contamination of food, feed and agricultural commodities by aflatoxins poses enormous economic and serious health concerns because these chemicals are highly carcinogenic and can directly influence the structure of DNA. The resulting genetic defects can lead to fetal misdevelopment and miscarriages; aflatoxins are also known to suppress immune systems (Razzaghi-Abyaneh et al., 2013). In a global context, aflatoxin contamination is a constant concern between the 35N and 35S latitude where developing countries are mainly situated. With expanding boundaries of developing countries, aflatoxin contamination has become a persistent problem to those emerging areas (Shams-Ghahfarokhi et al., 2013). The continuing threat by aflatoxin contamination of food, feed and agricultural commodities to the world population has made aflatoxin research one of the most exciting and rapidly developing study areas of microbial toxins. The present research topic includes six review articles, three mini reviews and four original research articles. Contributors highlight current global health issues arising from aflatoxins and aflatoxigenic fungi and cover important aspects of aflatoxin research including contamination of crops, epidemiology, molecular biology and management strategies. Special attention is given to fungus-plant host interactions, biodiversity and biocontrol, sexual recombination in aflatoxigenic aspergilli, potential biomarkers for aflatoxin exposure in humans and safe storage programs. Perrone et al. (2014) reported the expected risk of a shift in aflatoxin problems toward new territories particular in South East of Europe due to increasing average temperatures. Giving an overview on genetic diversity of A. flavus populations in Europe, the authors stressed the importance of selecting stable atoxigenic A. flavus strains as biocontrol agents. In the review of climate change on A. flavus growth and aflatoxin production, Medina et al. (2014) focused on the potential impact of key environmental factors, such as water activity (aw), temperature and atmospheric CO2, and their interactions on ecology, growth and aflatoxin production by the A. flavus both in vitro and on maize. The authors showed that while such interacting abiotic factors have little effect on fungal growth, they however have a significant impact on aflatoxin biosynthetic gene expression and can stimulate the production of aflatoxins. In the insightful mini-review on sexual recombination in aflatoxin-producing Aspergillus species, Moore (2014) concisely summarized the potential negative impact of sexual recombination on the feasibility of using biological controls to reduce aflatoxin contamination of field crops. The author discussed specifically the implication of sexual recombination on the fate of two commercially available biopesticides: AF36 and Afla-Guard®. In the excellent review on the characteristics of A. flavus as well as the biocontrol strategy using non-toxigenic A. flavus strains, Ehrlich (2014) described the current state and outlook of this application in agricultural field. The author concluded that understanding genetic variations among A. flavus strains is critical for developing a robust biocontrol strategy, and it is unlikely that a “one size fits all” strategy will work for preharvest aflatoxin reduction. Host resistance is a very attractive area on aflatoxin research, and various aspects of A. flavus-plant host interaction were investigated with special focuses on mechanisms resistant to fungal growth and aflatoxin production (Dolezal et al., 2014; Fountain et al., 2014; Hruska et al., 2014; Scarpari et al., 2014; Shan and Williams, 2014). In the up-to-date review on environmental influences on aflatoxin production on maize, Fountain et al. (2014) detailed the history of research on this complex interaction and pointed out future directions for elucidating host resistance and susceptibility to A. flavus colonization in relation to abiotic stress such as drought and heat stresses, and oxidative stress in which aflatoxin may function as an antioxidant to the producing fungus. Utilizing an aflatoxigenic Green Fluorescence Protein (GFP) A. flavus strain, Hruska et al. (2014) investigated invasion, colonization and competition in maize kernels by this engineered strain. The authors showed that a decrease in aflatoxin production is correlated with depression of the aflatoxigenic population by the biocontrol strain, AF36, supporting the theory of competitive exclusion. Using a lipidomic approach to investigate A. flavus-maize interactions, Scarpari et al. (2014) suggested that A. flavus elicits the production of oxylipins in host plants, which function as signals for regulating aflatoxins biosynthesis, conidiogenesis and sclerotia formation. Their results highlighted the important role of maize oxylipins in driving secondary metabolism in A. flavus. In the microarray study to identify maize genes expressed during pathogen infection, Dolezal et al. (2014) found that metabolic processes are linked to defense responses, which include physical changes within the kernel as well as a disruption in kernel development. Shan and Williams (2014) provided a concise but clear overview of current knowledge about quantitative trait loci of corn related to aflatoxin contamination and ongoing efforts in the development of resistant corn lines. The authors concluded that the “phenotypic traits/data” established based on transcriptomics and proteomics approaches could be translated into the practices for improving corn resistance. Human exposure to aflatoxins is another challenging but not well studied area. In the concise overview of aflatoxin contamination of foods and related biomarker research, Mohd-Redzwan et al. (2013) described the historical problems related to aflatoxins in Malaysia, and how these problems have influenced the Malaysian population by highlighting the aflatoxin concentrations in basic food products and their comparison with established aflatoxin limits. The authors emphasized the importance of the legislation of law for a more controlled food production, legal enforcement to meet the set regulatory standards, and the improvement of pre and post-harvest techniques to reduce aflatoxin amounts in food and hence to decrease diseases in Malaysian population. In the comprehensive review about using microRNAs as specific molecular biomarkers in populations exposed to aflatoxins and as early markers for evidence of presence of or damage by hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), Valencia-Quintana et al. (2014) described differential expression of microRNAs under specific conditions related not only to chemical and environmental pollutants but also to biological pollutants such as the presence of aflatoxins in humans and animals, and consequently, their influence over HCC. The authors provided findings that are important to toxicological research because microRNAs can be used to predict the toxicity of some compounds and will help to explore new treatments. In a well designed study aimed at enhancing antimycotic activities of known antifungal chemicals by natural compounds, Kim et al. (2014) successfully increased chemosensitization of a kresoxim methyl (Kre-Me), a natural fungicide from strobilurin class by chemically-synthesized benzo analogs. The authors found that among tested benzo analogs, octylgallate (OG) inhibits both growth and aflatoxin production by toxigenic aspergilli more efficiently. The study provided good evidence of remarkable synergism between OG and Kre-Me, which enhances the effectiveness of Kre-Me considerably. The efficient chemosensitizing capability of OG in increasing the efficacy of Kre-Me could reduce effective dosages of strobilurins and alleviate negative side effects associated with the current antifungal treatment. Finally, as one of the most important and practical issues on aflatoxin research, aflatoxin prevention and elimination, Villers (2014) presented laboratory and field data on an Ultra Hermetic™ storage system, which creates an unbreatheable atmosphere through insect and microorganism respiration alone, in preventing the exponential production and accumulation of aflatoxins. This system is proven useful during multi-month post-harvest safe storage tests of maize, rice and peanuts in hot, humid countries. The author further stressed the need for research on post-harvest protection against aflatoxin contamination by determining the frequency at which excessive aflatoxin levels are reached in the field vs. after months of post-harvest storage using this system. In conclusion, this research topic opens exciting perspectives on global health issues related to aflatoxins in the food chain and on the development of suitable strategies for preventing toxigenic fungal growth in field and storage, thereby reducing or eliminating subsequent aflatoxin contamination of our food supplies.","ducer of essential protein, a vital transportation artery, a source of great danger (from storms, hurricanes, typhoons, tsunamis, and venomous and predatory animals) and the greatest mystery on the planet, inspiring untold realms of poetry and prose. The oceans are the world’s most important sources of biological activity, water, biodiversity, and biomass production. They supply food, oxygen, and other natural products critical for human existence, and interactions between the oceans and atmosphere shape our climate and weather. Today, we recognize the oceans for all these attributes and also for their marvelous, incredible, and almost infinite diversity of life forms and life processes, as well as the extraordinary potential for many of those life forms, biological and physical processes, and other resources to be harnessed for human welfare. We are just beginning to understand the numerous and complex ways in which humans can affect the oceans, and the oceans, in turn, can affect human health, including the discovery of new pharmaceuticals to fight human illnesses. Although not truly an island, the United States is bordered on all sides by seas, and the lands immediately adjacent to the coast annually contribute over $1 trillion to the U.S. economy. In addition, our coastal waters provide invaluable waste processing and other ecologic services for free. Approximately 25% of the country’s land area lies within coastal counties, which provide homes and workplaces for > 50% of our population. In addition, ocean-based tourism is the fastest growing component of the coastal economy, with hundreds of millions of Americans and international guests visiting our coasts annually. Not surprisingly, coastal population densities are several times higher than in the rest of the nation, and coastal sprawl is consuming land at ≥ 3 times the rate of population growth. These trends are projected to continue and may accelerate, resulting in permanent alterations to a large portion of the coastal landscape and potentially serious impacts on marine ecosystems and public health. Estuaries—those places where freshwater rivers meet and mix with the saltwater of the ocean—are dynamic environments renowned for their ecologic complexity, biological productivity, and seafood harvests and for the critical nursery habitat they provide for many ecologically and economically important species. Linking the land to the sea, the shallow tidal creeks and embayments along the shores of larger estuaries are the first zone of impact for many of the chemical and microbial pollutants washed or released into estuaries. As nurseries for the early and generally most sensitive life-history stages of many species of fish and invertebrates, these areas may provide early warnings of ensuing harm to the environment and to humans. In addition, the continental shelf and even the open ocean show increasing evidence of human-derived pollutants, such as occurrences of pathogens and persistent organic pollutants in offshore marine mammals. Estuarine and coastal processes are increasingly being affected by humans, with consequent impacts on coastal ecosystems and the humans who live, work, and play there. Principal sources of pollution are urban and agricultural runoff, municipal sewage discharges, atmospheric deposition of airborne pollutants, and industrial wastewater. Other causes of degradation include shoreline modification, overfishing, introduction of invasive species, and high-density recreational use. Increasing incidences of beach closures, fish and shellfish consumption advisories, harmful algal blooms, and occurrence of toxic chemicals and pathogenic microorganisms in coastal waters, sediments, and biota are indicative of the extent of the problem. Changes in marine ecosystems due to global warming and other stressors also pose increased threats to human health from microbial agents transmitted via water, food, or other vectors, or which may be harbored in animal reservoirs. The safety and economic risks of extreme weather events, climate change, and rising sea levels to those who live on or visit our coasts are reasonably well known. However, while cases of human illness linked directly or indirectly to stressed estuarine and coastal environments are being documented with increasing frequency, the risks to human health from continued and expanded impairment of coastal and ocean environments remain very poorly understood. Globally, nontraumatic human illnesses documented in relation to coastal processes typically are associated with a) consumption of pathogencontaminated or chemically contaminated seafood; b) spread of human pathogens (e.g., cholera) via the release of poorly treated or untreated sewage into coastal waters; c) exposure to toxins from harmful algae; and d) effects of weather and climate on the rates and means of transmission and severity of infectious diseases. Other associations are more elusive, probably because we have not looked in the right places using the right technologies. Existing national and regional monitoring and assessment programs have focused on the measurement of persistent chemicals, particularly in deeper estuarine sediments. Much more attention should be paid to assessing known or potential human pathogens and contaminants and emerging contaminants of concern such as newly registered pesticides, pharmaceuticals, and fire retardants in shallow estuarine and marine waters, coastal retention ponds, continental shelf environments, and the open ocean. New approaches and collaborations are required if we are to understand and resolve the large-scale environmental and public health problems facing the United States’ predominantly coastal population. As the U.S. Commission on Ocean Policy (2004) stated in its preliminary report, “Significant investment must be put into developing a coordinated national research effort to better understand the links between the oceans and human health ....” The interdisciplinary Oceans and Human Health (OHH) initiatives now being undertaken by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and jointly by the National Science Foundation and National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences provide the first steps toward a coordinated effort to transcend traditional disciplines and boundaries and focus a broad array of scientific intellect on developing regional and national solutions to environmental and public health issues of increasing complexity involving cumulative impacts from multiple stressors. Deriving such solutions will require a sustained and concentrated effort of scientific talent from multiple disciplines and institutions, development of new technologies and new understanding of ecosystem dynamics, and effective transfer of critical information to natural resource and public health managers and to the public at large. These new OHH initiatives should help","Aflatoxins (AFs) are the most important toxic, mutagenic, and carcinogenic fungal toxins that routinely contaminate food and feed. While more than 20 AFs have been identified to date, aflatoxin B1 (AFB1), B2 (AFB2), G1 (AFG1), G2 (AFG2), and M1 (AFM1) are the most common. Over 25 species of Aspergillus have been shown to produce AFs, with Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus parasiticus, and Aspergillus nomius being the most important and well-known AF-producing fungi. These ubiquitous molds can propagate on agricultural commodities to produce AFs in fields and during harvesting, processing, transportation, and storage. Countries with warmer climates and that produce foods susceptible to AF contamination shoulder a substantial portion of the global AF burden. Pakistan’s warm climate promotes the growth of toxigenic fungi, resulting in frequent AF contamination of human foods and animal feeds. The potential for contamination in Pakistan is exacerbated by improper storage conditions and a lack of regulatory limits and enforcement mechanisms. High levels of AFs in common commodities produced in Pakistan are a major food safety problem, posing serious health risks to the population. Furthermore, aflatoxin contamination contributes to economic losses by limiting exports of these commodities. In this review, recent information regarding the fungal producers of AFs, prevalence of AF contamination of foods and feed, current regulations, and AF prevention and removal strategies are summarized, with a major focus on Pakistan.",24.6139482925387,Soil Environmental
