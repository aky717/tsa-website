The purpose of the present study was to address various sources of stress among dental school students and its relation with gender and year of the study. Materials and Methods: A questionnaire based cross-sectional study was conducted among 3 rd and 4 th year students of a dental school. Questionnaire used in the study comprised the modified version of the questionnaire used in Dental Environmental Stress. A four-point Likert scale was used to record the responses from the subjects. A total of 174 subjects participated in the study. Statistical analysis was done using SPSS package version 16. Results: Of the participants, 39% (68) were males and 61% (106) were females. Majority of students felt stressed about academic performance, clinic/patient related stress, and career related stress. Top stressors in academic performance related stress were exam and grade stress (95%), followed by fear of failing (90.5%), lack of time between tests/clinics, and criticism at work (94%). Mean stress scores were significantly related to year and gender of students. Conclusion: Worries about fulfilling clinical requirements, academics, exam stress, and insecurity regarding career were the major sources of stress reported by the clinical year dental students in the present study.","Our previous research Kost et al., Phys. Rev. ST Phys. Educ. Res. 5, 010101 2009 examined gender differences in the first-semester, introductory physics class at the University of Colorado at Boulder. We found that: 1 there were gender differences in several aspects of the course, including conceptual survey performance, 2 these differences persisted despite the use of interactive engagement techniques, and 3 the post-test gender differences could largely be attributed to differences in males’ and females’ prior physics and math performance and their incoming attitudes and beliefs. In the current study, we continue to characterize gender differences in our physics courses by examining the second-semester, electricity and magnetism course. We analyze three factors: student retention from Physics 1 to Physics 2, student performance, and students’ attitudes and beliefs about physics, and find gender differences in all three of these areas. Specifically, females are less likely to stay in the physics major than males. Despite males and females performing about equally on the conceptual pretest, we find that females score about 6 percentage points lower than males on the conceptual post-test. In most semesters, females outperform males on homework and participation, and males outperform females on exams, resulting in course grades of males and females that are not significantly different. In terms of students’ attitudes and beliefs, we find that both males and females shift toward less expertlike beliefs over the course of Physics 2. Shifts are statistically equal for all categories except for the Personal Interest category, where females have more negative shifts than males. A large fraction of the conceptual post-test gender gap up to 60% can be accounted for by differences in males’ and females’ prior physics and math performance and their pre-Physics 2 attitudes and beliefs. Taken together, the results of this study suggest that it is an accumulation of small gender differences over time that may be responsible for the large differences that we observe in physics participation of males and females.","Objectives The study objectives were to identify the stress levels and to explore the impact of students' year of study and gender on the perceived sources of stress among Malaysian dental students. Methods This was a cross-sectional study involving dental students from year one to year five from private and public universities in Malaysia. The study was formally approved by the Research and Ethics Committee, International Medical University Malaysia. Dental Environment Stress (DES) questionnaire was used for data collection and the gathered data were analyzed using SPSS® version 18. The Kruskal-Wallis and the Mann-Whitney U tests were used to compare stress items across various academic years and universities. Results A total of five hundred and twenty nine (529) students participated in this study. Fear of failing the course at the end of year exams (mean stress level=5.57); concerns regarding completion of clinical work (mean=5.30); and examination results and grades (mean=5.27) were found as top stressors among dental students. Female students had higher stress scores than males with respect to personal issues, academic performance, educational environment and learning of clinical skills. Students from public universities had higher stress scores than their counterparts from private universities. Conclusion The Malaysian dental students reported higher levels of stress. Present study identified stressors affecting dental students' academic life, and highlights the importance of stress management programs and other measures to minimize the impact of stress on both academic and personal lives of the students.","As adolescents spend the majority of their time focused on exams and assignments, they do not have sufficient time to engage in physical activity; this lack of physical activity is an important public health concern. This study aimed to investigate how school-based physical activity programs affect the health-related physical fitness of adolescents in the Republic of Korea. For this study, a total of 120 high school students participated in a school-based physical activity program that included badminton and table tennis for 15 weeks each (35 min/day, three times a week), with a total of 30 weeks for one academic year. The parameters for health-related physical fitness measured muscle strength (handgrip strength), power (standing long jump), cardiorespiratory fitness (shuttle run test), flexibility (sit and reach), body mass index (BMI), and the total score. The results revealed a statistically significant improvement in muscle strength (p < 0.001), power (p < 0.001), cardiorespiratory fitness (p < 0.001), flexibility (p = 0.005), and the overall health-related physical fitness score (p = 0.001). However, students’ BMI showed no significant difference before and after participation (p = 0.825). The results of this study indicated that school-based physical activity programs can have a positive effect on the health-related physical fitness of adolescents.","The “ gender gap ” on various physics conceptual evaluations has been extensively studied. Men ’ s average pretest scores on the Force Concept Inventory and Force and Motion Conceptual Evaluation are 13% higher than women ’ s, and post-test scores are on average 12% higher than women ’ s. This study analyzed the gender differences within the Conceptual Survey of Electricity and Magnetism (CSEM) in which the gender gap has been less well studied and is less consistent. In the current study, data collected from 1407 students (77% men, 23% women) in a calculus-based physics course over ten semesters showed that male students outperformed female students on the CSEM pretest (5%) and post-test (6%). Separate analyses were conducted for qualitative and quantitative problems on lab quizzes and course exams and showed that male students outperformed female students by 3% on qualitative quiz and exam problems. Male and female students performed equally on the quantitative course exam problems. The gender gaps within CSEM post-test scores, qualitative lab quiz scores, and qualitative exam scores were insignificant for students with a CSEM pretest score of 25% or less but grew as pretest scores increased. Structural equation modeling demonstrated that a latent variable, called Conceptual Physics Performance/Non-Quantitative (CPP/NonQnt), orthogonal to quantitative test performance was useful in explaining the differences observed in qualitative performance; this variable was most strongly related to CSEM post-test scores. The CPP/NonQnt of male students was 0.44 standard deviations higher than female students. The CSEM pretest measured CPP/NonQnt much less accurately for women ( R 2 ¼ 4% ) than for men ( R 2 ¼ 17% ). The failure to detect a gender gap for students scoring 25% or less on the pretest suggests that the CSEM instrument itself is not gender biased. The failure to find a performance difference in quantitative test performance while detecting a gap in qualitative performance suggests the qualitative differences do not result from psychological factors such as science anxiety or stereotype threat.

Methods: A cross-sectional study was done among 142 first-year Bachelor of Medicine–Bachelor of Surgery and Bachelor of Dental Surgery students from February to May 2018. Demographic data and various academic performance marks were recorded for each individual. VARK (visual, aural, read/write and kinesthetic) questionnaire version 7.8 was administered to calculate the score of each component. Mean VARK scores were calculated and each student classified by their preferred mode of learning. The preferred mode of learning was compared with sex, nationality, faculty of students, and academic performance using χ2, unpaired t-tests, and the Mann–Whitney U test. P<0.05 was taken as statistically significant for comparison. Results: A majority of the students (53.52%) were multimodal. The most common multimodal mode of preference was bimodal (26.06%), while the most common unimodal preference was kinesthetic (29.06%). Total V score, K score, and VARK score were higher among males, while A and R scores were higher among females. The K score (7.96±2.35 in males and 6.96±2.43 in females) differed significantly (P=0.019) between male and female subjects. More subjects with higher scores in the theory exam of anatomy were unimodal learners (53.8%) compared to multimodal learners (46.2%). Conclusion: From this study, it can be concluded that undergraduate students were diverse in their learning styles, but most were multimodal. Though learning styles were found to vary by sex, nationality, and academic performance, differences were not statistically significant.","Submissions to an online homework tutor were analyzed to determine whether they were copied. The fraction of copied submissions increased rapidly over the semester, as each weekly deadline approached and for problems later in each assignment. The majority of students, who copied less than 10% of their problems, worked steadily over the three days prior to the deadline, whereas repetitive copiers those who copied 30% of their submitted problems exerted little effort early. Importantly, copying homework problems that require an analytic answer correlates with a 2 decline over the semester in relative score for similar problems on exams but does not significantly correlate with the amount of conceptual learning as measured by pretesting and post-testing. An anonymous survey containing questions used in many previous studies of self-reported academic dishonesty showed 1 /3 less copying than actually was detected. The observed patterns of copying, free response questions on the survey, and interview data suggest that time pressure on students who do not start their homework in a timely fashion is the proximate cause of copying. Several measures of initial ability in math or physics correlated with copying weakly or not at all. Changes in course format and instructional practices that previous self-reported academic dishonesty surveys and/or the observed copying patterns suggested would reduce copying have been accompanied by more than a factor of 4 reduction of copying from 11% of all electronic problems to less than 3%. As expected since repetitive copiers have approximately three times the chance of failing, this was accompanied by a reduction in the overall course failure rate. Survey results indicate that students copy almost twice as much written homework as online homework and show that students nationally admit to more academic dishonesty than MIT students.","Abstract Self-assessment is vital for online learning since it is one of the most essential skills of distance learners. In this respect, the purpose of this study was to understand learners’ self-assessment quiz taking behaviours in an undergraduate level online course. We tried to figure out whether there is a relation between self-assessment quiz taking behaviours and final exam scores or not. In addition, we investigated how self-assessment quiz taking behaviour differs with respect to learner profile. In line with this purpose, 677 students’ 6092 test events across Project Culture course on Sakai CLE LMS were analyzed. For the analysis of the quantitative data, one-way ANOVA, Chi-Square test of independence, independent-samples t-test and descriptive statistics were utilized. The results revealed that learners who attended self-assessment quizzes regularly had higher final exam scores than others who did not attend those quizzes. Also, they were more satisfied with the course than others study field. In addition, learners who attended selfassessment quizzes regularly had a higher degree of perceived learning. However, number of attempts to those quizzes does not have an effect on final exam scores. On the other hand, a statistically significant relationship was found between attempt number and gender in favour of female learners.","OBJECTIVES The aim of this study was to assess the psychological health of first-year health professional students and to study sources of student stress. METHODS All first-year students (N = 125) of the Gulf Medical University (GMU) in Ajman, United Arab Emirates (UAE), were invited to participate in a voluntary, anonymous, self-administered, questionnaire-based survey in January 2011. Psychological health was assessed using the 12-item General Health Questionnaire. A 24-item questionnaire, with items related to academic, psychosocial and health domains was used to identify sources of stress. Pearson's chi-squared test and the Mann-Whitney U-test were used for testing the association between psychological morbidity and sources of stress. RESULTS A total of 112 students (89.6%) completed the survey and the overall prevalence of psychological morbidity was found to be 33.6%. The main academic-related sources of stress were 'frequency of exams', 'academic workload', and 'time management'. Major psychosocial stressors were 'worries regarding future', 'high parental expectations', 'anxiety', and 'dealing with members of the opposite sex'. Health-related issues were 'irregular eating habits', 'lack of exercise', and 'sleep-related problems'. Psychological morbidity was not significantly associated with any of the demographic factors studied. However, total stress scores and academics-related domain scores were significantly associated with psychological morbidity. CONCLUSION Psychological morbidity was seen in one in three first-year students attending GMU. While worries regarding the future and parental expectations were sources of stress for many students, psychological morbidity was found to be significantly associated with only the total stress and the academic-related domain scores.","OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to assess the relationship between the use of neuroenhancing substances, exam anxiety and academic performance among first-year Bosnian-Herzegovinian (BH) university students. METHODS In a cross-sectional study, an ad hoc questionnaire was delivered to a sample of BH first-year university students. The following data were collected: socio-demographic features, consumption of neuroenchancing substances, the Westside Test Anxiety Scale (WTAS) and academic performance. RESULTS A total of 214 students were included. Consumption of lifestyle substances, coffee, energy drinks, nicotine, alcohol, and marijuana, for the purpose of neuroenhancement increased during the week before the exams. OTC cognitive enhancer use was reported by 31.0%, and of benzodiazepines by 1.5% of students. No psycostimulants were used. A high to extremely high exam WTAS score was reported in 38.3% students. The exam WTAS score was positively correlated with consumption of coffee (rho=0.31; P<0.001), energy drinks (rho=0.18; P=0.009), and nicotine (rho=0.22; P=0.001), and negatively correlated with last exam grade (rho=-0.33; P<0.001). The exam WTAS score was a significant independent predictor (OR=0.55; 95% CI 0.31 to 0.97, P=0.039) for self-assessed academic performance. Self-assessed academic performance was positively correlated with last exam grade (rho=0.15; P=0.043). CONCLUSIONS Although first-year BH university students do not seem to use either prescription or illicit psycostimulants, the consumption of nicotine, alcohol, and marijuana is worrying. However, the consumption of these neuroenhancing substances seems not to be related to better self-assessed academic performance. Finally, exam anxiety seems to be a significant problem among BH first-year university students.",16.6907064341035,2,"stress, physic, academ_perform"

Materials and Methods: This was a quasi-experimental study conducted in three stages on 49 male and female nursing students divided into two groups (study and control). In the pre-test stage, demographic data and Sarason anxiety questionnaires were filled by 94 students (of terms 3 and 4). Then, in the intervention stage, the students having test anxiety were assigned to two groups (study and control), and the progressive muscle relaxation method was performed in the experiment group in four sessions. Then, the students did this method two times a day until final exams, immediately following which they filled the self-reported checklists. On the first day of the final exams, test anxiety questionnaire was filled by the two groups again. The collected data were analyzed by the statistical tests, i.e. χ2, paired t-test, independent sample t-test, Mann–Whitney and Wilcoxon tests, using SPSS 18. Results: Independent t-test showed a significant difference in the mean scores of test anxiety after intervention between the two groups of study and control (P = 0.00), but this difference was not significant before intervention (P = 0.76). Also, in the study group, there was a significant difference in the mean scores of test anxiety before and after intervention (P = 0.00), but this difference was not significant in the control group (P = 0.09). Mann–Whitney test showed no significant difference in categorization of test anxiety scores before intervention in the study and control groups (P = 0.60), but the difference was significant after intervention (P = 0.00). Wilcoxon test showed a significant difference in categorization of test anxiety scores in the study group before and after intervention (P = 0.00), but the difference was not significant in the control group (P = 0.083). Conclusions: Generally, the results showed that performing progressive muscle relaxation method was effective in reducing test anxiety among nursing students. It is suggested to conduct educational programs concerning this method in the faculties of nursing to decrease the test anxiety of nursing students.","Introduction Emergency care of older adults requires specialized knowledge of their unique physiology, atypical presentations, and care transitions. Older adults often require distinctive assessment, treatment and disposition. Emergency medicine (EM) residents should develop expertise and efficiency in geriatric care. Older adults represent over 25% of most emergency department (ED) volumes. Yet many EM residencies lack curricula or assessment tools for competent geriatric care. Fully educating residents in emergency geriatric care can demand large amounts of limited conference time. The Geriatric Emergency Medicine Competencies (GEMC) are high-impact geriatric topics developed to help residencies efficiently and effectively meet this training demand. This study examines if a 2-hour didactic intervention can significantly improve resident knowledge in 7 key domains as identified by the GEMC across multiple programs. Methods A validated 29-question didactic test was administered at six EM residencies before and after a GEMC-focused lecture delivered in summer and fall of 2009. We analyzed scores as individual questions and in defined topic domains using a paired student t test. Results A total of 301 exams were administered; 86 to PGY1, 88 to PGY2, 86 to PGY3, and 41 to PGY4 residents. The testing of didactic knowledge before and after the GEMC educational intervention had high internal reliability (87.9%). The intervention significantly improved scores in all 7 GEMC domains (improvement 13.5% to 34.6%; p<0.001). For all questions, the improvement was 23% (37.8% pre, 60.8% post; P<0.001) Graded increase in geriatric knowledge occurred by PGY year with the greatest improvement post intervention seen at the PGY 3 level (PGY1 19.1% versus PGY3 27.1%). Conclusion A brief GEMC intervention had a significant impact on EM resident knowledge of critical geriatric topics. Lectures based on the GEMC can be a high-yield tool to enhance resident knowledge of geriatric emergency care. Formal GEMC curriculum should be considered in training EM residents for the demands of an aging population.","Background: Test anxiety often leads to poor academic performance. This study aimed to determine the effect of computer-based tests on nursing students’ test anxiety. Methods: This quasi-experimental study was conducted in 2016 on 39 nursing student with anxiety score under 128 on Spielberger’s State-Trait Inventory (STAI). They were randomly allocated to computer-based tests (CBT) and paper-based test (PBT) group. Prior to exam, all students completed Sarason’s Test Anxiety Scale (TAS). We administered CBT for students in experimental group. Data were analyzed using independent t-test and one-way ANOVA. Results: Students mean test anxiety score was 11.94 and 11.32 in CBT and PBT groups, respectively. 47.4% of students in CBT group and 29.4% of those in PBT group experienced higher test anxiety, while the difference was not significant (p=0.56). Conclusions: Despite, there was no significant difference between anxiety score of two groups; but students’ test anxiety score was higher in CBT group. With the current increase in computer-based assessment, educational administrators must be aware of and plan for the possible unfavorable effects of computer assisted testing, such an anxiety. Future studies are needed to evaluate and compare the effect of different type of student testing such as distance testing or CBTs using new information technologies such as laptop, tablet or mobile phone on students’ test anxiety and performance.","Collaborative testing has been shown to improve performance but not always content retention. In this study, we investigated whether collaborative testing could improve both performance and content retention in a large, introductory biology course. Students were semirandomly divided into two groups based on their performances on exam 1. Each group contained equal numbers of students scoring in each grade category (“A”–“F”) on exam 1. All students completed each of the four exams of the semester as individuals. For exam 2, one group took the exam a second time in small groups immediately following the individually administered test. The other group followed this same format for exam 3. Individual and group exam scores were compared to determine differences in performance. All but exam 1 contained a subset of cumulative questions from the previous exam. Performances on the cumulative questions for exams 3 and 4 were compared for the two groups to determine whether there were significant differences in content retention. Even though group test scores were significantly higher than individual test scores, students who participated in collaborative testing performed no differently on cumulative questions than students who took the previous exam as individuals.","Rotator cuff tears have been reported to be uncommon following total shoulder arthroplasty (TSA). Postoperative rotator cuff tears can lead to pain, proximal humeral migration, and glenoid component loosening. The purpose of this paper was to evaluate the incidence of post-TSA rotator cuff tears or dysfunction in osteoarthritic patients. A systematic review of multiple databases was performed using preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses guidelines. Levels I-IV evidence clinical studies of patients with primary osteoarthritis with a minimum 2-year follow-up were included. Fifteen studies with 1259 patients (1338 shoulders) were selected. Student's t-tests were used with a significant alpha value of 0.05. All patients demonstrated significant improvements in motion and validated clinical outcome scores (P < 0.001). Radiographic humeral head migration was the most commonly reported data point for extrapolation of rotator cuff integrity. After 6.6 ± 3.1 years, 29.9 ± 20.7% of shoulders demonstrated superior humeral head migration and 17.9 ± 14.3% migrated a distance more than 25% of the head. This was associated with an 11.3 ± 7.9% incidence of postoperative superior cuff tears. The incidence of radiographic anterior humeral head migration was 11.9 ± 15.9%, corresponding to a 3.0 ± 13.6% rate of subscapularis tears. We found an overall 1.2 ± 4.5% rate of reoperation for cuff injury. Nearly all studies reported indirect markers of rotator cuff dysfunction, such as radiographic humeral head migration and clinical exam findings. This systematic review suggests that rotator cuff dysfunction following TSA may be more common than previously reported. IV, systematic review of Levels I-IV studies.","Background Medical student ultrasound education is sparse. In 2002, we began the first medical student rotation in emergency ultrasound. Objective To evaluate if medical students can learn and retain sonographic skills during a two- or four-week elective. Methods We gave students an exam on the first and last days of the rotation. Six months later, students took the exam a third time. A control group was used for comparison. Results Over a 19-month period, we enrolled 45 students (25 on the two-week and 20 on the four-week elective). The four-week student post-test score was significantly better than the two- week post-test score (81% vs 72%, p=0.003). On the six-month exam, the four-week student post-test score was significantly better than the two-week post-test score (77% vs 69%, p=0.008). The control group did not statistically improve. Conclusion Medical students can learn bedside ultrasound interpretation with clinical integration and retain the knowledge six months later.","Background Traditional teaching concepts in medical education do not take full advantage of current information technology. We aimed to objectively determine the impact of Tablet PC enhanced training on learning experience and MKSAP® (medical knowledge self-assessment program) exam performance. Methods In this single center, prospective, controlled study final year medical students and medical residents doing an inpatient service rotation were alternatingly assigned to either the active test (Tablet PC with custom multimedia education software package) or traditional education (control) group, respectively. All completed an extensive questionnaire to collect their socio-demographic data, evaluate educational status, computer affinity and skills, problem solving, eLearning knowledge and self-rated medical knowledge. Both groups were MKSAP® tested at the beginning and the end of their rotation. The MKSAP® score at the final exam was the primary endpoint. Results Data of 55 (tablet n = 24, controls n = 31) male 36.4%, median age 28 years, 65.5% students, were evaluable. The mean MKSAP® score improved in the tablet PC (score Δ + 8 SD: 11), but not the control group (score Δ- 7, SD: 11), respectively. After adjustment for baseline score and confounders the Tablet PC group showed on average 11% better MKSAP® test results compared to the control group (p<0.001). The most commonly used resources for medical problem solving were journal articles looked up on PubMed or Google®, and books. Conclusions Our study provides evidence, that tablet computer based integrated training and clinical practice enhances medical education and exam performance. Larger, multicenter trials are required to independently validate our data. Residency and fellowship directors are encouraged to consider adding portable computer devices, multimedia content and introduce blended learning to their respective training programs.","The shortage of nursing faculty has contributed greatly to the nursing workforce shortage, with many schools turning away qualified applicants because there are not enough faculty to teach. Despite the faculty shortage, schools are required to admit more students to alleviate the nursing shortage. Clinical groups in which preceptors are responsible for student learning extend faculty resources. Purpose. To determine the effectiveness of an alternative clinical experience (preceptorship). Methods. quasi-experimental, randomized, longitudinal design. Students were randomized to either the traditional or precepted clinical group. The clinical experience was a total of 12 weeks. Groups were compared according to several variables including second semester exam scores, HESI scores, and quality and timeliness of clinical paperwork. Sample. Over a two-year period, seventy-one undergraduate nursing students in the second semester medical-surgical nursing course participated. 36 were randomized to the experimental group. The preceptors were baccalaureate-prepared nurses who have been practicing for at least one year. Setting. Two hospitals located in the Texas Medical Center. Statistical Analysis. Descriptive statistics and independent t-test. Results. There was no difference between the groups on the variables of interest. Conclusion. Students in the precepted clinical group perform as well as those in a traditional clinical group.","Abstract Objective: To evaluate whether computer-based learning (CBL) improves newly acquired knowledge and is an effective strategy for teaching prenatal ultrasound diagnostic skills to third-year medical students when compared with instruction by traditional paper-based methods (PBM). Study Design: We conducted a randomized, prospective study involving volunteer junior (3rd year) medical students consecutively rotating through the Obstetrics and Gynecology clerkship during six months of the 2005-2006 academic year. The students were randomly assigned to permuted blocks and divided into two groups. Half of the participants received instruction in prenatal ultrasound diagnostics using an interactive CBL program; the other half received instruction using equivalent material by the traditional PBM. Outcomes were evaluated by comparing changes in pre-tutorial and post instruction examination scores. Results: All 36 potential participants (100%) completed the study curriculum. Students were divided equally between the CBL (n=18) and PBM (n=18) groups. Pre-tutorial exam scores (mean ± s.d.) were 44% ± 11.1% for the CBL group and 44% ± 10.8% for the PBL cohort, indicating no statistically significant differences (p > 0.05) between the two groups. After instruction, post-tutorial exam scores (mean ± s.d.) were increased from the pre-tutorial scores, 74% ± 11% and 67% ± 12%, for students in the CBL and the PBM groups, respectively. The improvement in post-tutorial exam scores from the pre-test scores was considered significant (p < 0.05). When post-test scores for the tutorial groups were compared, the CBL subjects achieved a score that was, on average, 7 percentage points higher than their PBM counterparts, a statistically significant difference (p < 0.05). Conclusion: Instruction by either CBL or PBM strategies is associated with improvements in newly acquired knowledge as reflected by increased post-tutorial examination scores. Students that received CBL had significantlyhigher post-tutorial exam scores than those in the PBM group, indicating that CBL is an effective instruction strategy in this setting.","Background Point-of-care ultrasonography (PoCUS) is a rapidly evolving discipline that aims to train non-cardiologists, non-radiologists clinicians in performing bedside ultrasound to guide clinical decision. Training of PoCUS is challenging, time-consuming and requires large amount of resources. The objective of our study was to evaluate if this training process can be simplified by allowing medical students self-train themselves with a web-based cardiac ultrasound software. Methods A prospective, single blinded, cohort study, comparing performance of 29 medical students in performing a six-minutes cardiac ultrasound exam. Students were divided into two groups: self-learning group, using a combination of E-learning software and self-practice using pocket ultrasound device compared to formal, frontal cardiac ultrasound course. Results All 29 students completed their designated courses and performed the six-minutes exam: 20 students participated in the frontal cardiac ultrasound course and 9 completed the self-learning course. The median (Q1,Q3) test score for the self-learning group was higher than the frontal course group score, 18 (15,19) versus 15 (12,19.5), respectively. Nevertheless, no statistically significant difference was found between the two study groups (p = 0.478). All students in the self-learning course group (9/9, 100%) and 16 (16/20, 80%) of students in the frontal ultrasound course group obtained correct alignment of the parasternal long axis view (p = 0.280). Conclusions Self-learning students combining E-learning software with self-practice cardiac ultrasound were as good as students who received a validated, bedside, frontal cardiac ultrasound course. Our findings suggest that independent cardiac ultrasound learning, combining utilization of E–learning software and self-practice, is feasible. Self-E- learning of cardiac ultrasound may serve as an important, cost-effective adjunct to heavily resource consuming traditional teaching.",17.0131993625342,0,"anxieti, control, nurs"

In the undergraduate medical education system in India, curricular guidelines of Medical Council of India lay emphasis on methods of assessment of knowledge and skills in pharmacology.[1] Although continuous formative assessment constitutes an integral part in the curriculum, the ‘pass’ and the ‘fail’ certificates are based to a great extent on students’ performance in the final summative examination. The final examination consists of written papers, viva-voce sessions and practical exercises. Written examination consists of two papers. Each paper has the maximum marks of 40 and contains structured essay type questions and short notes. In viva-voce examination, each student is assessed by five examiners; two of them external examiners and the others internal examiners. In order to pass, a candidate must obtain 50% marks in aggregate with a minimum of 50% marks in written and viva together and a minimum of 50% marks in practical examination.[1] The written examination is a useful evaluation format that not only tests students’ ability to recall facts, but also can assess higher-order cognitive functions, such as interpretation of data and problem solving skills. The viva-voce examination on the other hand is a general encounter between a candidate and one or more examiners.[2] Viva-voce examinations are less reliable as they are essentially subjective in nature, afflicted with ‘halo effects’, errors of central tendency, a general tendency toward leniency, and errors of contrast.[2] Examiners mostly indulge in over-marking in viva-voce examinations in order to make an otherwise undeserving candidate ‘pass’. We explored this recently in a small questionnaire-based interview among examiners of pharmacology in one university and the examiners admitted showing such ‘leniency’. Against this backdrop, we planned the present study to compare students’ performance in written and viva-voce components of the final summative pharmacology examination in MBBS curriculum in order to have a critical insight into the two modes of evaluation, the way they are practiced. This was a record-based observational study done in a medical college in India that also served as an examination centre for second professional MBBS examination in pharmacology for four consecutive years, from 2008 to 2011. The performance of students was assessed. Permission for access to the students’ score sheets was obtained from appropriate authority and confidentiality of individual student’s score was maintained. Percentage of marks obtained by four batches of students (n=589), in consecutive years (2008-11), in written and viva-voce components of the final summative examination in pharmacology were reviewed: Batch 1 (Jan 2011 Exam, n=159), Batch 2 (Jan 2010 Exam, n=139), Batch 3 (Jan 2009 Exam, n=148), Batch 4 (Jan 2008 Exam, n=143). Based on their performance in terms of percentage of marks in aggregate, all students in a batch were classified into four categories viz., ‘failed’(F) – <50%, ‘borderline passed’ (BP) – 50-57%, ‘passed’ (P) – >57% to <75% and ‘passed with distinction’ (PD) – ≥75%. Correlation was assessed between the percentage of marks obtained by students in these categories in written vis-a-vis viva-voce examination. Highly significant association was observed in marks obtained by students in P and PD categories in all four batches in viva-voce and written examination (P<0.001). However, no significant association was observed in marks obtained by students in F and BP categories in all four batches in viva-voce and written examination (P>0.05). The results are shown in Table 1. Interestingly, no student in F category got 50% marks in written examination, but most of them scored satisfactorily in the viva-voce. Among all the students in F category, three students in 2008, five in 2009, four in 2010 and none in 2011 failed in practical examination. The number of students in each category (e.g., F, BP, P and PD) when compared among the 4 years (2008-11) did not show any significant difference [Figure 1]. Our study showed that there was highly significant association between written and viva-voce marks of students in the PD and P categories (P<0.001). We interpret this as the ‘true’ reflection of knowledge and competence of the students in this category. Our study also revealed that there was a lack of significant association in performance in written and viva-voce examination among students in F and BP categories (P>0.05). Marks obtained by students in viva-voce were higher with respect to those in written examination in these two categories. Rather, the poorer the performance in written examination, the higher the marks obtained in the viva-voce. Such trend is most prominent in the F category of students Access this article online","Background Large language models, such as ChatGPT by OpenAI, have demonstrated potential in various applications, including medical education. Previous studies have assessed ChatGPT’s performance in university or professional settings. However, the model’s potential in the context of standardized admission tests remains unexplored. Objective This study evaluated ChatGPT’s performance on standardized admission tests in the United Kingdom, including the BioMedical Admissions Test (BMAT), Test of Mathematics for University Admission (TMUA), Law National Aptitude Test (LNAT), and Thinking Skills Assessment (TSA), to understand its potential as an innovative tool for education and test preparation. Methods Recent public resources (2019-2022) were used to compile a data set of 509 questions from the BMAT, TMUA, LNAT, and TSA covering diverse topics in aptitude, scientific knowledge and applications, mathematical thinking and reasoning, critical thinking, problem-solving, reading comprehension, and logical reasoning. This evaluation assessed ChatGPT’s performance using the legacy GPT-3.5 model, focusing on multiple-choice questions for consistency. The model’s performance was analyzed based on question difficulty, the proportion of correct responses when aggregating exams from all years, and a comparison of test scores between papers of the same exam using binomial distribution and paired-sample (2-tailed) t tests. Results The proportion of correct responses was significantly lower than incorrect ones in BMAT section 2 (P<.001) and TMUA paper 1 (P<.001) and paper 2 (P<.001). No significant differences were observed in BMAT section 1 (P=.2), TSA section 1 (P=.7), or LNAT papers 1 and 2, section A (P=.3). ChatGPT performed better in BMAT section 1 than section 2 (P=.047), with a maximum candidate ranking of 73% compared to a minimum of 1%. In the TMUA, it engaged with questions but had limited accuracy and no performance difference between papers (P=.6), with candidate rankings below 10%. In the LNAT, it demonstrated moderate success, especially in paper 2’s questions; however, student performance data were unavailable. TSA performance varied across years with generally moderate results and fluctuating candidate rankings. Similar trends were observed for easy to moderate difficulty questions (BMAT section 1, P=.3; BMAT section 2, P=.04; TMUA paper 1, P<.001; TMUA paper 2, P=.003; TSA section 1, P=.8; and LNAT papers 1 and 2, section A, P>.99) and hard to challenging ones (BMAT section 1, P=.7; BMAT section 2, P<.001; TMUA paper 1, P=.007; TMUA paper 2, P<.001; TSA section 1, P=.3; and LNAT papers 1 and 2, section A, P=.2). Conclusions ChatGPT shows promise as a supplementary tool for subject areas and test formats that assess aptitude, problem-solving and critical thinking, and reading comprehension. However, its limitations in areas such as scientific and mathematical knowledge and applications highlight the need for continuous development and integration with conventional learning strategies in order to fully harness its potential.","Introduction: Nowadays according to competency based curriculum, selecting an appropriate assessment method is inevitable. This study aimed to investigate application of Direct Observation of Procedural Skills (DOPS) in undergraduate medical students. Methods: This is a cross sectional study conducted during emergency ward rotation in last year medical students using consensus sampling method. Each student performed 2 procedures at least twice under the observation of 2 assessors using modified DOPS rating scales designed for each procedure simultaneously. Correlation between DOPS score and final routine exam was measured. Face and content validity was determined by the panel of experts. Moreover, through the test-retest and inter-rater reliability, the correlation of each score and total score was investigated. The spent time was calculated too. The statistical analysis was carried out using SPSS version 18. Results: Totally 60 students did 240 procedures under DOPS. The face and content validity confirmed by an expert panel. The findings showed that there was a significant correlation between the scores of each test and the total DOPS score (r1=0.736**, r2=0.793**, r3=0.564**, r4=0.685**; p<0.001). There was a significant correlation between the first and second scores of doing the same procedure (Pearson Cor.=0.74, p<0.001) and also between the scores of the two individual examiners when observing the same procedure (Pearson Cor.=0.84-0.94 p<0.001). The results showed that there was no correlation (Pearson Correlation =0.018, p<0.89) between the scores of this test and the final routine ward exam scores. The average time for doing DOPS test and the average time for providing feedback were 11.17 Max and 9.2 4.5 Min, respectively. Conclusion: The use of novel performance assessment methods such as DOPS is highly beneficial in order to ensure the adequacy of learning in medical students and assess their readiness for accepting professional responsibilities. DOPS as a practical and reliable test with acceptable validation can be used to assess clinical skills of undergraduate medical students.","Educational systems have advanced with the use of electronic learning (e-learning), which is a promising solution for long-distance learners. Students who engage in e-learning can access tests and exams online, making education more flexible and accessible. This work reports on the design of an e-learning system that makes recommendations to students to improve their learning. This artificial intelligence-based student assessment and recommendation (AISAR) system consists of score estimation, clustering, performance prediction, and recommendation. In addition, the importance of student authentication is recognised in situations in which students must authenticate themselves prior to using the e-learning system using their identity, password, and personal identification number. Individual scores are determined using a recurrent neural network (RNN) based on student engagement and examination scores. Then, a density-based spatial clustering algorithm (DBSCAN) using Mahalanobis distance clustering is implemented to group students based on their obtained score values. The constructed clusters are validated by estimating purity and entropy. Student performance is predicted using a threshold-based MapReduce (TMR) procedure from the score-based cluster. When predicting student performance, students are classified into two groups: average and poor, with the former being divided into below- and above-average students and the latter into poor and very poor students. This categorisation aims to provide useful recommendations for learning. A recommendation reinforcement learning algorithm, the rule-based state–action–reward–state–action (R-SARSA) algorithm, is incorporated for evaluation. Students were required to work on their subjects according to the provided recommendations. This e-learning recommendation system achieves better performance in terms of true-positives, false-positives, true-negatives, false-negatives, precision, recall, and accuracy.","BACKGROUND The Objective Structured Clinical Evaluation (OSCE) has been considered a reliable method for the evaluation of students' clinical skills in health sciences, but it has been rarely applied in the teaching of physical therapy. OBJECTIVE To assess the use of the OSCE as a tool to evaluate the abilities of undergraduate chest physical therapy students and to verify the internal consistency of the OSCE exam. METHODS Forty-seven students were evaluated using two types of exams: the traditional exam and the OSCE. Independent educators elaborated the exams. Each question (traditional) or station (OSCE) was given a score ranging from 0.0 to 2.0; being 10.0 the highest possible score of both exams. The relationship between the total score that were obtained from both exams was analyzed using Bland-Altman analysis and Pearson's correlation coefficient. The internal consistency of the OSCE stations was evaluated by four experienced chest physical therapists and it was tested using Cronbach's alpha. RESULTS The students' average score on the OSCE ranged from 4.4 to 9.6. The internal consistency of the OSCE stations was considered good (0.7). The agreement between exams was analyzed, and it was determined that the exams are not comparable. Examiners also observed a low agreement between the two exams (r=-0.1; p=0.9). CONCLUSION Our results showed that OSCE and traditional exams are not interchangeable. The OSCE exam had good internal consistency and is able to evaluate aspects that the traditional exam fails to evaluate.","Background Objective Structured Clinical Examinations (OSCEs) have been used to assess the clinical competence of medical students for decades. Limited data are available on the factors that predict students’ performance on the OSCEs. The aim of our study was to evaluate the factors predicting performance on the pediatrics final OSCE, including the timing of students’ clerkship and their performance on the in-training OSCE and written examinations. Methods Grades in pediatrics for 3 consecutive academic years (2013–2016) were included. The average scores of the in-training OSCEs, written and final OSCEs and written exams were compared among the three years using the analysis of variance (ANOVA) test. The correlations between performance on the final OSCEs and the in-training OSCEs, in-training written exams and final written exams were studied using Spearman’s Rho correlation test. The effect of the timing of the clerkship on the final OSCE performance was evaluated. Results A total of 286 students’ records were included. There were 115 male students and 171 female students (M:F 1:1.5). There were strong positive correlations between students’ performance on the in-training examinations (OSCE and written) and the final OSCE (correlation coefficients of 0.508 and 0.473, respectively). The final written exam scores were positively correlated with the final OSCEs (r = 0.448). There was no significant effect of the timing of the clerkship. Conclusions Students’ performance on in-training examinations might predict their final OSCE scores. Thus, it is important to provide students with the necessary intervention at an early stage to reduce failure rates. The final OSCE performance does not seem to be affected by the timing of the clerkship.","Assessment Test is one of the routine agenda that is carried out every semester change. This test is conducted to see the development of students in learning activities. Currently SMK 5 Kota Tangerang already uses a mobile application using the PENTAS application in answering the exam questions. But this application needs to be done to understand applications that can be used properly, or vice versa. This study uses the System Usability Scale (SUS) method to measure the use of this application for use. This SUS method has 10 questions that will be answered by respondents who are directly involved in using the PENTAS application. The average score obtained by the System Use Scale method is 46.00. These results fall into the Unacceptable category, so this PENTAS application is not good for use.","Background: Undergraduate medical examination is undergoing extensive re evaluation with new core educational objectives being defined. Consequently, new exam systems have also been designed to test the objectives. Objective structured practical examination (OSPE) is one of them. Objectives: To introduce OSPE as a method of assessment of practical skills and learning and to determine student satisfaction regarding the OSPE. Furthermore, to explore the faculty perception of OSPE as a learning and assessment tool. Materials and Methods: The first M.B.B.S students of 2011 12 batch of Medical College, Kolkata, were the subjects for the study. OSPE was organized and conducted on “Identification of Unknown Abnormal Constituents in Urine.” Coefficient of reliability of questions administered was done by calculating Cronbach's alpha. A questionnaire on various components of the OSPE was administered to get the feedback. Results: 16 students failed to achieve an average of 50% or above in the assessment. However, 49 students on an average achieved >75%, 52 students achieved between 65% and 75%, and 29 students scored between 50% and 65%. Cronbach's alpha of the questions administered showed to be having high internal consistency with a score of 0.80. Ninety nine percent of students believed that OSPE helps them to improve and 81% felt that this type of assessment fits in as both learning and evaluation tools. Faculty feedback reflected that such assessment tested objectivity, measured practical skills better, and eliminated examiner bias to a greater extent. Conclusion: OSPE tests different desired components of competence better and eliminated examiner bias. Student feedback reflects that such assessment helps them to improve as it is effective both as teaching and evaluation tools.","Background Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing with their ability to generate human-like text through extensive training on large data sets. These models, including Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPT)-3.5 (OpenAI), GPT-4 (OpenAI), and Bard (Google LLC), find applications beyond natural language processing, attracting interest from academia and industry. Students are actively leveraging LLMs to enhance learning experiences and prepare for high-stakes exams, such as the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET) in India. Objective This comparative analysis aims to evaluate the performance of GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and Bard in answering NEET-2023 questions. Methods In this paper, we evaluated the performance of the 3 mainstream LLMs, namely GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and Google Bard, in answering questions related to the NEET-2023 exam. The questions of the NEET were provided to these artificial intelligence models, and the responses were recorded and compared against the correct answers from the official answer key. Consensus was used to evaluate the performance of all 3 models. Results It was evident that GPT-4 passed the entrance test with flying colors (300/700, 42.9%), showcasing exceptional performance. On the other hand, GPT-3.5 managed to meet the qualifying criteria, but with a substantially lower score (145/700, 20.7%). However, Bard (115/700, 16.4%) failed to meet the qualifying criteria and did not pass the test. GPT-4 demonstrated consistent superiority over Bard and GPT-3.5 in all 3 subjects. Specifically, GPT-4 achieved accuracy rates of 73% (29/40) in physics, 44% (16/36) in chemistry, and 51% (50/99) in biology. Conversely, GPT-3.5 attained an accuracy rate of 45% (18/40) in physics, 33% (13/26) in chemistry, and 34% (34/99) in biology. The accuracy consensus metric showed that the matching responses between GPT-4 and Bard, as well as GPT-4 and GPT-3.5, had higher incidences of being correct, at 0.56 and 0.57, respectively, compared to the matching responses between Bard and GPT-3.5, which stood at 0.42. When all 3 models were considered together, their matching responses reached the highest accuracy consensus of 0.59. Conclusions The study’s findings provide valuable insights into the performance of GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and Bard in answering NEET-2023 questions. GPT-4 emerged as the most accurate model, highlighting its potential for educational applications. Cross-checking responses across models may result in confusion as the compared models (as duos or a trio) tend to agree on only a little over half of the correct responses. Using GPT-4 as one of the compared models will result in higher accuracy consensus. The results underscore the suitability of LLMs for high-stakes exams and their positive impact on education. Additionally, the study establishes a benchmark for evaluating and enhancing LLMs’ performance in educational tasks, promoting responsible and informed use of these models in diverse learning environments.","Objectives The study aimed to compare candidate performance between traditional best-of-five single-best-answer (SBA) questions and very-short-answer (VSA) questions, in which candidates must generate their own answers of between one and five words. The primary objective was to determine if the mean positive cue rate for SBAs exceeded the null hypothesis guessing rate of 20%. Design This was a cross-sectional study undertaken in 2018. Setting 20 medical schools in the UK. Participants 1417 volunteer medical students preparing for their final undergraduate medicine examinations (total eligible population across all UK medical schools approximately 7500). Interventions Students completed a 50-question VSA test, followed immediately by the same test in SBA format, using a novel digital exam delivery platform which also facilitated rapid marking of VSAs. Main outcome measures The main outcome measure was the mean positive cue rate across SBAs: the percentage of students getting the SBA format of the question correct after getting the VSA format incorrect. Internal consistency, item discrimination and the pass rate using Cohen standard setting for VSAs and SBAs were also evaluated, and a cost analysis in terms of marking the VSA was performed. Results The study was completed by 1417 students. Mean student scores were 21 percentage points higher for SBAs. The mean positive cue rate was 42.7% (95% CI 36.8% to 48.6%), one-sample t-test against ≤20%: t=7.53, p<0.001. Internal consistency was higher for VSAs than SBAs and the median item discrimination equivalent. The estimated marking cost was £2655 ($3500), with 24.5 hours of clinician time required (1.25 s per student per question). Conclusions SBA questions can give a false impression of students’ competence. VSAs appear to have greater authenticity and can provide useful information regarding students’ cognitive errors, helping to improve learning as well as assessment. Electronic delivery and marking of VSAs is feasible and cost-effective.",16.0422144323448,4,"examin, correl, clinic"

When a student doubts themself and their own ability to test well, the students' sole focus becomes worrying about poor grades and cannot focus on academics (Bandura, 1993). But, little is understood about how test-anxiety and self-efficacy affect short-term success in the classroom. Specifically, how test anxiety and level of self-efficacy directly preceding an exam will affect the exam score. Pre-and post-questionnaires assessing anxiety and self-efficacy immediately before and after a single college exam was completed by 110 college students and exam grades were obtained from the instructor. Results showed a strong relationship between both test anxiety and exam grades, and self-efficacy and exam grades. Further, multiple linear regression analyses showed that exam grade could be predicted by test anxiety and self-efficacy level, and that self-efficacy moderated the effects of anxiety.","Does school climate ameliorate or exacerbate the impact of neighborhood violent crime on test scores? Using administrative data from the New York City Department of Education and the New York City Police Department, we find that exposure to violence in the residential neighborhood and an unsafe climate at school lead to substantial test score losses in English language arts (ELA). Middle school students exposed to neighborhood violent crime before the ELA exam who attend schools perceived to be less safe or to have a weak sense of community score 0.06 and 0.03 standard deviations lower, respectively. We find the largest negative effects for boys and Hispanic students in the least safe schools, and no effect of neighborhood crime for students attending schools with better climates.","OBJECTIVE: Stress is a condition caused by various factors and characterized by imbalance in body functioning, impair in nervous system, and tension. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of cortisol level, which increases in healthy young individuals due to stress, on dynamic and static balance scores as well as to present the results caused by high levels of stress. METHODS: In this study, 107 healthy medicine faculty students in their second year (who will take the same committee exam) aged between 19 and 23 years were included. The first balance measurements and saliva samples were taken 40 days before the committee exam, and this period was acknowledged as the relaxed period. The same students were considered for balance measurements again on the day of committee exam; saliva samples were collected, and cortisol concentration was determined. This period was acknowledged as the stressful period. The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) was given to the participants in their relaxed and stressful periods. Dynamic balance scores were measured with Star Excursion Balance Test (SEBT). Static balance scores were measured with One Leg Standing Balance Test (OLSBT). RESULTS: The mean cortisol level was found to increase approximately 9 times in stressful periods compared with that in relaxed periods. STAI, which shows state anxiety, showed an increase supporting this increase. In stressful periods, dynamic balance scores showed obvious decrease in all directions. In addition, in stressful periods, an obvious decrease was observed in static balance scores compared with those in relaxed periods. CONCLUSION: This study showed that stress negatively affected dynamic and static balance, even for short periods of time. We believe that our study will form a positive source and basis when correlated with long terms stress and balance measurements.","This paper examines the relationship between the type of senior high school attended by Indonesian youth and their subsequent labor market outcomes. This topic is very timely, given the governments recent decision to dramatically expand vocational enrollment. The analysis controls for an unusually rich set of predetermined characteristics, and exploits longitudinal data spanning 14 years to separately identify cohort and age effects. There are four main findings. First, students are sorted into different school types largely on the basis of their entering exam score. Public schools attract the highest-scoring students, while private vocational schools serve the lowest-scoring students. Second, after controlling for a variety of characteristics, including test scores, male public school graduates earn a substantial premium over their privately schooled counterparts. Third, private vocational school graduates fare at least as well as private general graduates, despite coming from more disadvantaged socioeconomic backgrounds. Finally, the returns to public vocational education have declined sharply for the most recent cohort of men. This raises important concerns about the current expansion of public vocational education, and the relevance of the male vocational curriculum in an increasingly service-oriented economy.","The current study examined the effect of high school graduation exams on states' graduation rates, states' aggregated SAT scores, and individual students' SAT scores. Three data sources were used: One source identified states requiring a standardized test for graduation; the NCES provided state aggregated data on graduation rates for the class of 2002; and the College Board provided its 2001 SAT database for all test-takers. After controlling for students' demographic characteristics (e.g., race, family education and income, GPA and class rank), regression analyses revealed that states requiring graduation exams had lower graduation rates and lower SAT scores. Individually, students from states requiring a graduation exam performed more poorly on the SAT than did students from states not requiring an exam. The impact of high stakes tests' on students' motivation to stay in school and on the teaching of critical thinking skills (tested by the SAT) are discussed.","This article examines the effect of exposure to violent crime on studentsâ€™ standardized test performance among a sample of students in New York City public schools. To identify the effect of exposure to community violence on childrenâ€™s test scores, we compare students exposed to an incident of violent crime on their own blockface in the week prior to the exam to students exposed in the week after the exam. The results show that such exposure to violent crime reduces performance on English language arts assessments and has no effect on math scores. The effect of exposure to violent crime is most pronounced among African Americans and reduces the passing rates of black students by approximately 3 percentage points.","Pass rates by Texas tenth-graders on the high school exit exam improved from 52 percent in 1994 to 72 percent in 1998. In his article ""The Myth of the Texas Miracle in Education"" (EPAA, August 2000) Professor Walt Haney argued that some part of this increased pass rate was, as he put it, an illusion. Haney contended that the combined effects of students dropping out of school prior to taking the 10th grade TAAS and special education exemptions accounted for much of the increase in TAAS pass rates. Relying on the same methodology and data that Haney used, we demonstrate that his conclusion is incorrect. None of the 20 percent improvement in the TAAS exit test pass rate between 1994 and 1998 is explained by combined increases in dropout rates or special education exemptions.","Using data from Indonesia, Newhouse and Beegle to evaluate the impact of school type on academic achievement of junior secondary school students (grades 7-9). Students that graduate from public junior secondary schools, controlling for a variety of other characteristics, score 0.15 to 0.3 standard deviations higher on the national exit exam than comparable privately schooled peers. This finding is robust to OLS, fixed-effects, and instrumental variable estimation strategies. Students attending Muslim private schools, including Madrassahs, fare no worse on average than students attending secular private schools. The results provide indirect evidence that higher quality inputs at public junior secondary schools promote higher test scores.","Historically, admissions committees for biomedical Ph.D. programs have heavily weighed GRE scores when considering applications for admission. The predictive validity of GRE scores on graduate student success is unclear, and there have been no recent investigations specifically on the relationship between general GRE scores and graduate student success in biomedical research. Data from Vanderbilt University Medical School’s biomedical umbrella program were used to test to what extent GRE scores can predict outcomes in graduate school training when controlling for other admissions information. Overall, the GRE did not prove useful in predicating who will graduate with a Ph.D., pass the qualifying exam, have a shorter time to defense, deliver more conference presentations, publish more first author papers, or obtain an individual grant or fellowship. GRE scores were found to be moderate predictors of first semester grades, and weak to moderate predictors of graduate GPA and some elements of a faculty evaluation. These findings suggest admissions committees of biomedical doctoral programs should consider minimizing their reliance on GRE scores to predict the important measures of progress in the program and student productivity.","This study provides a systematic review of the literature on teachers’ cognitive abilities (intelligence test scores and proxies of cognitive abilities such as college entrance exam scores and basic skills test scores) and teacher effectiveness. Twenty-seven studies conducted between 2000 and 2019 constitute the sample for this review. Studies using intelligence test scores were rare, with the results indicating no or negative associations with teacher effectiveness. Studies on proxies of cognitive abilities yielded, at most, small positive relations with teacher effectiveness. However, behind these overall results regarding proxies of cognitive abilities lie interesting heterogeneities, as several studies analyzing different test domains uncover a differentiated pattern of findings. We also identify key limitations related to construct measurement, sampling approaches, statistical analyses and the interpretation and reporting of the included studies, and outline a path for future research on teachers’ cognitive abilities and teacher effectiveness.",25.1654085821656,3,"teacher, level, predict"

The type of research used in this research is quantitative research with correlational methods. The population in this study were all 65 students of class VII at SMP Negeri 4 Maniamolo. The sampling technique uses a total sampling technique, meaning that the entire population is used as a sample. The instrument in this study used a closed questionnaire and students' science learning outcomes were in the form of odd semester final exam scores. Data analysis techniques were carried out by describing the data, correlational analysis, coefficient of determination and hypothesis testing. The test results in this study indicate that there is a positive and significant relationship between learning interest on science learning outcomes, and there is also an influence between learning interest on Integrated Science learning outcomes. So it was concluded that 1) because students have a sense of pleasure, interest, and a high desire for learning which is seen as giving them benefits and satisfaction, 2) students have a sense of comfort, are aware of the benefits of learning, and know the learning goals that make them interested so that learning occurs. improvement in learning outcomes.","This study aims to determine a positive and significant relationship as well as an influence between students' interest in learning and their mathematics learning outcomes. The research method used in this study is quantitative research with a correlational approach. The population in this study consists of all eighth-grade students at SMP Negeri 1 Toma, totaling 65 students. The sampling technique used is total sampling, meaning the entire population is used as the sample. The instruments in this study include closed-ended questionnaires and students' mathematics learning outcomes in the form of even semester final exam scores (UKK). Data analysis techniques involve describing the data, correlational analysis, coefficient of determination, and hypothesis testing. The results of this study show that there is a positive and significant relationship between students' interest in learning and their mathematics learning outcomes, and there is also an influence of students' interest in learning on their mathematics learning outcomes. It can be concluded that 1) because students have a sense of enjoyment, interest, and a high desire to learn that they perceive as beneficial and satisfying, and 2) students feel comfortable, are aware of the benefits of learning, and understand the learning objectives, which makes them interested and leads to an improvement in learning outcomes.","Undergraduate students struggle to read the scientific literature and educators have suggested that this may reflect deficiencies in their science literacy skills. In this two-year study we develop and test a strategy for using the scientific literature to teach science literacy skills to novice life science majors. The first year of the project served as a preliminary investigation in which we evaluated student science literacy skills, created a set of science literacy learning objectives aligned with Bloom’s taxonomy, and developed a set of homework assignments that used peer-reviewed articles to teach science literacy. In the second year of the project the effectiveness of the assignments and the learning objectives were evaluated. Summative student learning was evaluated in the second year on a final exam. The mean score was 83.5% (±20.3%) and there were significant learning gains (p < 0.05) in seven of nine of science literacy skills. Project data indicated that even though students achieved course-targeted lower-order science literacy objectives, many were deficient in higher-order literacy skills. Results of this project suggest that building scientific literacy is a continuing process which begins in first-year science courses with a set of fundamental skills that can serve the progressive development of literacy skills throughout the undergraduate curriculum.","Environmental literacy is an attitude and behavior that must be possessed by a student in protecting the environment. Therefore, it is necessary to carry out a plan and action to empower environmental literacy through education. This study aimed to determine the effect of the problem-based learning with environmental-based comic (PBLEC) model in empowering students' environmental literacy in Indonesia. This type of research was a quasi-experimental posttest-pretest non-equivalent control group design study involving 97 students at the University of Muhammadiyah Makassar, South Sulawesi, Indonesia. Students' environmental literacy data was obtained by using an exam technique using an essay test instrument sheet, then the results were analyzed using descriptive statistics and one-way inferential analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). The results of statistical analysis showed that the PBLEC model has an effect on students' environmental literacy. The average score achieved by students in the class group using PBLEC is higher than students who are taught by the problem-based learning (PBL) learning process and conventional learning. Therefore, the use of the PBLEC model can be used in the learning process as an effort to grow and improve student environmental literacy.","The COVID-19 pandemic forced teaching to be shifted to an online platform. Since the flipped teaching (FT) model has been shown to engage students through active learning strategies and adapt both synchronous and asynchronous components, it was a convenient choice for educators familiar with this instructional method. This study tested the effectiveness of a virtual FT method during the pandemic in a graduate-level physiology course. Besides assessing knowledge gained in the virtual FT format, student surveys were used to measure student perception of their adjustment to the new FT format, their confidence in completing the course successfully, and the usefulness of assessments and assignments in the remote FT. Students reported that they adjusted well to the remote FT method (P < 0.001), and their confidence in completing the course in this teaching mode successfully improved from the beginning to the end of the semester (P < 0.05). Students expressed a positive response to the synchronous computerized exams (90.32%) and the formative group (93.51%) and individual (80.65%) assessments. Both collaborative activities (93.55%) and in-class discussions (96.77%) were found to be effective. The course evaluations and the overall semester scores were comparable to the previous semesters of face-to-face FT. Overall, students’ perceptions and performance suggested that they embraced the virtual FT method and the tested teaching method maintained the same strong outcome as before. Thus, this study presents a promising new instructional method in the teaching of future physiology courses.","The aim of this study is to determine the effect of Learning Modeling System (LMS) Moodle in learning. The population is taken from all students of Mathematics Education, University of PGRI Semarang. The sample was randomly selected from five different course groups. The initial score is taken from the semester test, and the final score is taken through the semester test after the five groups are taught using Moodle. The results of both test results are compared to find out the increase in learning outcomes. Meanwhile, the student's attitude toward learning is taken through his mathematical disposition through questionnaire. The results show that there was a significant increase in exam results on the final exam of the semester. This result is supported by student learning interest which increases on average after using LMS Moodle taken from disposition data.","OBJECTIVES Team-based learning (TBL) is used in the medical field to implement interactive learning in small groups. The learning of anatomy and its subsequent application requires the students to recall a great deal of factual content. The aims of this study were to evaluate the students' satisfaction, engagement and knowledge gain in anatomy through the medium of TBL in comparison to the traditional lecture method. METHODS This study, carried out from February to June 2012, included 30 physical therapy students of the Shiraz University of Medical Science, School of Rehabilitation Sciences. Classic TBL techniques were modified to cover lower limb anatomy topics in the first year of the physical therapy curriculum. Anatomy lectures were replaced with TBL, which required the preparation of assigned content, specific discussion topics, an individual self-assessment test (IRAT) and the analysis of discussion topics. The teams then subsequently retook the assessment test as a group (GRAT). The first eight weeks of the curriculum were taught using traditional didactic lecturing, while during the second eight weeks the modified TBL method was used. The students evaluated these sessions through a questionnaire. The impact of TBL on student engagement and educational achievement was determined using numerical data, including the IRAT, GRAT and final examination scores. RESULTS Students had a higher satisfaction rate with the TBL teaching according to the Likert scale. Additionally, higher scores were obtained in the TBL-based final examination in comparison to the lecture-based midterm exam. CONCLUSION The students' responses showed that the TBL technique could be used alone or in conjunction with traditional didactic lecturing in order to teach anatomy more effectively.","This study evaluates the use of role-playing games (RPGs) as a methodological approach for teaching cellular biology, assessing student satisfaction, learning outcomes, and retention of acquired knowledge. First-year undergraduate medical students at two Brazilian public universities attended either an RPG-based class (RPG group) or a lecture (lecture-based group) on topics related to cellular biology. Pre- and post-RPG-based class questionnaires were compared to scores in regular exams and in an unannounced test one year later to assess students' attitudes and learning. From the 230 students that attended the RPG classes, 78.4% responded that the RPG-based classes were an effective tool for learning; 55.4% thought that such classes were better than lectures but did not replace them; and 81% responded that they would use this method. The lecture-based group achieved a higher grade in 1 of 14 regular exam questions. In the medium-term evaluation (one year later), the RPG group scored higher in 2 of 12 questions. RPG classes are thus quantitatively as effective as formal lectures, are well accepted by students, and may serve as educational tools, giving students the chance to learn actively and potentially retain the acquired knowledge more efficiently.","Prerequisites are embedded in most STEM curricula. However, the assumption that the content presented in these courses will improve learning in later courses has not been verified. Because a direct comparison of performance between students with and without required prerequisites is logistically difficult to arrange in a randomized fashion, we developed a novel familiarity scale, and used this to determine whether concepts introduced in a prerequisite course improved student learning in a later course (in two biology disciplines). Exam questions in the latter courses were classified into three categories, based on the degree to which the tested concept had been taught in the prerequisite course. If content familiarity mattered, it would be expected that exam scores on topics covered in the prerequisite would be higher than scores on novel topics. We found this to be partially true for “Very Familiar” questions (concepts covered in depth in the prerequisite). However, scores for concepts only briefly discussed in the prerequisite (“Familiar”) were indistinguishable from performance on topics that were “Not Familiar” (concepts only taught in the later course). These results imply that merely “covering” topics in a prerequisite course does not result in improved future performance, and that some topics may be able to removed from a course thereby freeing up class time. Our results may therefore support the implementation of student-centered teaching methods such as active learning, as the time-intensive nature of active learning has been cited as a barrier to its adoption. In addition, we propose that our familiarity system could be broadly utilized to aid in the assessment of the effectiveness of prerequisites.","Background In recent years, pharmacists have been involved in expanded patient care responsibilities, for example patient counseling in self-medication, medication review and pharmaceutical care, which require graduates to develop the necessary competences. Consequently, reorientation of pharmacy education has become necessary. As such, active learning strategies have been introduced into classrooms to increase problem-solving and critical thinking skills of students. The objective of this study was to evaluate the performance and perceptions of competency of students in a new pharmaceutical care course that uses active learning methodologies. Methods This pharmaceutical care course was conducted in the first semester of 2014, in the Federal University of Sergipe. In the pharmaceutical care course, active learning methods were used, consisting of dialogic classroom expository, simulation and case studies. Student learning was evaluated using classroom tests and instruments that evaluated the perception of competency in pharmaceutical care practice. Furthermore, students' satisfaction with the course was evaluated. Results Thirty-three students completed the four evaluations used in the course (i.e., a discursive written exam, seminars, OSCE, and virtual patient); 25 were female (75.75%), and the median age was 23.43 (SD 2.82) years. The overall mean of student scores, in all evaluation methods was 7.97 (SD 0.59) on a scale of 0 to 10 points, and student performance on the virtual patient method was statistically superior to other methods. With respect to the perception of competency in pharmaceutical care practice, a comparison of pre- and post-test scores revealed statistically significant improvement for all evaluated competences. At the end of the semester, the students presented positive opinions of the pharmaceutical care course. Conclusions The results suggest that an active learning course can enhance the learning of pharmaceutical care competences. In future studies it will be necessary to compare active learning to traditional methods.",25.0884711888519,1,"tradit, teach, activ"
