Method Multiple linear regression, correlation, and chi-square analyses were performed to determine the relationship between MCAT component and composite scores and USMLE Step 1 and Step 2 CK scores from five graduating classes (2011–2015) at the University of Minnesota Medical School (N=1,065). Results The multiple linear regression analyses were both significant (p<0.001). The three MCAT component scores together explained 17.7% of the variance in Step 1 scores (p<0.001) and 12.0% of the variance in Step 2 CK scores (p<0.001). In the chi-square analyses, significant, albeit weak associations were observed between almost all MCAT component scores and USMLE scores (Cramer's V ranged from 0.05 to 0.24). Discussion Each of the MCAT component scores was significantly associated with USMLE Step 1 and Step 2 CK scores, although the effect size was small. Being in the top or bottom scoring range of the MCAT exam was predictive of being in the top or bottom scoring range of the USMLE exams, although the strengths of the associations were weak to moderate. These results indicate that MCAT scores are predictive of student performance on the USMLE exams, but, given the small effect sizes, should be considered as part of the holistic view of the student.","Information about score obtained from a test is often interpreted as an indicator of the student's ability level. This is one of the weaknesses of classical analysis that are unable to provide meaningful and fair information. The acquisition of the same score if it comes from a test item with a different level of difficulty, must show different abilities. Analysis of the Rasch model will overcome this weakness. The purpose of this study was to analyze the quality of the items by validating the national chemistry exam instrument using the Rasch model. The research sample was 212 new students of the Department of Chemistry at the State University of Medan. The data collected was in the form of respondent's answer data to the 2013 chemistry UN questions, which amounted to 40 items multiple choice and uses the documentation method. Data analysis technique used the Rasch Model with Ministep software. The results of the analysis show the quality of the Chemistry National Exam (UN) questions is categorized as very good based on the following aspects: unidimension, item fit test, person map item, difficulty test level, person and item reliability. There is one item found to be gender bias, in which men benefit more than women. The average chemistry ability of respondents is above the average level of difficulty of the test items","Objectives To examine the predictive validity of pre-admission variables on students’ performance in a medical school in Saudi Arabia. Methods In this retrospective study, we collected admission and college performance data for 737 students in preclinical and clinical years. Data included high school scores and other standardized test scores, such as those of the National Achievement Test and the General Aptitude Test. Additionally, we included the scores of the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) and the International English Language Testing System (IELTS) exams. Those datasets were then compared with college performance indicators, namely the cumulative Grade Point Average (cGPA) and progress test, using multivariate linear regression analysis. Results In preclinical years, both the National Achievement Test (p=0.04, B=0.08) and TOEFL (p=0.017, B=0.01) scores were positive predictors of cGPA, whereas the General Aptitude Test (p=0.048, B=-0.05) negatively predicted cGPA. Moreover, none of the pre-admission variables were predictive of progress test performance in the same group. On the other hand, none of the pre-admission variables were predictive of cGPA in clinical years. Overall, cGPA strongly predict-ed students’ progress test performance (p<0.001 and B=19.02). Conclusions Only the National Achievement Test and TOEFL significantly predicted performance in preclinical years. However, these variables do not predict progress test performance, meaning that they do not predict the functional knowledge reflected in the progress test. We report various strengths and deficiencies in the current medical college admission criteria, and call for employing more sensitive and valid ones that predict student performance and functional knowledge, especially in the clinical years.","Purpose Examine the factors improving performance on national medical licensing board examinations. Rationale Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) accredited residency programs report the United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE) Step 1 and Comprehensive Osteopathic Licensing Examination-USA (COMLEX-USA) Level 1 scores as the most important criteria in selecting candidates to interview. Hypotheses (1) Certain resources are superior for exam preparation. (2) Certain practice tests better assess exam preparedness. (3) USMLE performance will correlate with the COMLEX-USA. Methods One-hundred and two (102) medical students were surveyed regarding preparation for and performance on COMLEX-USA Level 1 and USMLE Step 1. Results USMLE-specific question banks were positively correlated with performance on COMLEX-USA Level 1 and USMLE Step 1 while COMLEX-specific question banks showed no correlation. National Board of Medical Examiners (NBME) Comprehensive Basic Science Self Assessment (CBSSA) and National Board of Osteopathic Medical Examiners (NBOME) Comprehensive Osteopathic Medical Self-Assessment Examination (COMSAE) practice examinations were positively correlated with performance on the USMLE Step 1 and the COMLEX-USA Level 1. Scores on USMLE Step 1 and COMLEX-USA Level 1 were highly correlated. Students who took USMLE Step 1 performed better on COMLEX-USA Level 1 than those who did not. Conclusion COMLEX-specific resources may not adequately prepare students for COMLEX-USA Level 1. Students studying for COMLEX-USA Level 1 may benefit by preparing for USMLE Step 1.","The current study examined the effect of high school graduation exams on states' graduation rates, states' aggregated SAT scores, and individual students' SAT scores. Three data sources were used: One source identified states requiring a standardized test for graduation; the NCES provided state aggregated data on graduation rates for the class of 2002; and the College Board provided its 2001 SAT database for all test-takers. After controlling for students' demographic characteristics (e.g., race, family education and income, GPA and class rank), regression analyses revealed that states requiring graduation exams had lower graduation rates and lower SAT scores. Individually, students from states requiring a graduation exam performed more poorly on the SAT than did students from states not requiring an exam. The impact of high stakes tests' on students' motivation to stay in school and on the teaching of critical thinking skills (tested by the SAT) are discussed.","Background Large language models, such as ChatGPT by OpenAI, have demonstrated potential in various applications, including medical education. Previous studies have assessed ChatGPT’s performance in university or professional settings. However, the model’s potential in the context of standardized admission tests remains unexplored. Objective This study evaluated ChatGPT’s performance on standardized admission tests in the United Kingdom, including the BioMedical Admissions Test (BMAT), Test of Mathematics for University Admission (TMUA), Law National Aptitude Test (LNAT), and Thinking Skills Assessment (TSA), to understand its potential as an innovative tool for education and test preparation. Methods Recent public resources (2019-2022) were used to compile a data set of 509 questions from the BMAT, TMUA, LNAT, and TSA covering diverse topics in aptitude, scientific knowledge and applications, mathematical thinking and reasoning, critical thinking, problem-solving, reading comprehension, and logical reasoning. This evaluation assessed ChatGPT’s performance using the legacy GPT-3.5 model, focusing on multiple-choice questions for consistency. The model’s performance was analyzed based on question difficulty, the proportion of correct responses when aggregating exams from all years, and a comparison of test scores between papers of the same exam using binomial distribution and paired-sample (2-tailed) t tests. Results The proportion of correct responses was significantly lower than incorrect ones in BMAT section 2 (P<.001) and TMUA paper 1 (P<.001) and paper 2 (P<.001). No significant differences were observed in BMAT section 1 (P=.2), TSA section 1 (P=.7), or LNAT papers 1 and 2, section A (P=.3). ChatGPT performed better in BMAT section 1 than section 2 (P=.047), with a maximum candidate ranking of 73% compared to a minimum of 1%. In the TMUA, it engaged with questions but had limited accuracy and no performance difference between papers (P=.6), with candidate rankings below 10%. In the LNAT, it demonstrated moderate success, especially in paper 2’s questions; however, student performance data were unavailable. TSA performance varied across years with generally moderate results and fluctuating candidate rankings. Similar trends were observed for easy to moderate difficulty questions (BMAT section 1, P=.3; BMAT section 2, P=.04; TMUA paper 1, P<.001; TMUA paper 2, P=.003; TSA section 1, P=.8; and LNAT papers 1 and 2, section A, P>.99) and hard to challenging ones (BMAT section 1, P=.7; BMAT section 2, P<.001; TMUA paper 1, P=.007; TMUA paper 2, P<.001; TSA section 1, P=.3; and LNAT papers 1 and 2, section A, P=.2). Conclusions ChatGPT shows promise as a supplementary tool for subject areas and test formats that assess aptitude, problem-solving and critical thinking, and reading comprehension. However, its limitations in areas such as scientific and mathematical knowledge and applications highlight the need for continuous development and integration with conventional learning strategies in order to fully harness its potential.","Objectives: To evaluate the correlation and concordance between the ‘Peruvian National Exam of Medicine’ (ENAM) and the Mean Grade Point Average (GPA) in recently graduated medical students in the period 2007 to 2009. Materials and Methods: We carried out a secondary data analysis, using the records of the physicians applying to the Rural and Urban Marginal Service in Health of Peru (SERUMS) processes for the years 2008 to 2010. We extracted from these registers, the grades obtained in the ENAM and GPA. We performed a descriptive analysis using medians and 1 st and 3 rd quartiles (q1/q3); we calculated the correlation between both scores using the Spearman correlation coefficient, additionally, we conducted a lineal regression analysis, and the concordance was measured using the Bland and Altman coefficient. Results: A total of 6 117 physicians were included, the overall median for the GPA was 13.4 (12.7/14.2) and for the ENAM was 11.6 (10.2/13.0).Of the total assessed, 36.8% failed the TEST. We observed an increase in annual median of ENAM scores, with the consequent decrease in the difference between both grades. The correlation between ENAM and PPU is direct and moderate (0.582), independent from the year, type of university management (Public or Private) and location. However, the concordance between both ratings is regular, with a global coefficient of 0.272 (CI 95%: 0.260 to 0.284). Conclusions: Independently of the year, location or type of university management, there is a moderate correlation between the ENAM and the PPU; however, there is only a regular concordance between both grades.","Historically, admissions committees for biomedical Ph.D. programs have heavily weighed GRE scores when considering applications for admission. The predictive validity of GRE scores on graduate student success is unclear, and there have been no recent investigations specifically on the relationship between general GRE scores and graduate student success in biomedical research. Data from Vanderbilt University Medical School’s biomedical umbrella program were used to test to what extent GRE scores can predict outcomes in graduate school training when controlling for other admissions information. Overall, the GRE did not prove useful in predicating who will graduate with a Ph.D., pass the qualifying exam, have a shorter time to defense, deliver more conference presentations, publish more first author papers, or obtain an individual grant or fellowship. GRE scores were found to be moderate predictors of first semester grades, and weak to moderate predictors of graduate GPA and some elements of a faculty evaluation. These findings suggest admissions committees of biomedical doctoral programs should consider minimizing their reliance on GRE scores to predict the important measures of progress in the program and student productivity.","Objectives: To examine the relationship between study strategies and performance on a high stakes medical licensing exam entitled the United States Medical Licensing Examination Step 1. Methods: The action research project included seventy nine student participants at the Texas A&M Health Science Center College of Medicine during their pre-clinical education. Data collection included pre-matriculation and matriculation academic performance data, standardized exam data, and the Learning and Study Strategies Instrument. Multiple regression analyses were conducted. For both models, the dependent variable was the Step 1 score, and the independent variables included Medical College Admission Test, Undergraduate Grade Point Average, Year 1 Average, Year 2 Average, Customized National Board of Medical Examiners Average, Comprehensive Basic Science Exam score, and Learning and Study Strategy Instrument sub-scores. Model 2 added Comprehensive Basic Science Self-Assessment average. Results: Concentration (Model 1 - β = .264; Model 2 - β = .254) was the only study strategy correlated with Step 1 performance. The other statistically significant predictors were Customized National Board of Medical Examiners Average (β = .315) and Year 2 Average (β = .280) in Model 1 and Comprehensive Basic Science Self-Assessment Average (β = .338) in Model 2. Conclusions: There does appear to be a relationship between the study strategy concentration and Step 1 licensing exam performance. Teaching students to practice and utilize certain techniques to improve concentration skills when preparing for and taking exams may help improve licensing exam scores.","Introduction Emergency care of older adults requires specialized knowledge of their unique physiology, atypical presentations, and care transitions. Older adults often require distinctive assessment, treatment and disposition. Emergency medicine (EM) residents should develop expertise and efficiency in geriatric care. Older adults represent over 25% of most emergency department (ED) volumes. Yet many EM residencies lack curricula or assessment tools for competent geriatric care. Fully educating residents in emergency geriatric care can demand large amounts of limited conference time. The Geriatric Emergency Medicine Competencies (GEMC) are high-impact geriatric topics developed to help residencies efficiently and effectively meet this training demand. This study examines if a 2-hour didactic intervention can significantly improve resident knowledge in 7 key domains as identified by the GEMC across multiple programs. Methods A validated 29-question didactic test was administered at six EM residencies before and after a GEMC-focused lecture delivered in summer and fall of 2009. We analyzed scores as individual questions and in defined topic domains using a paired student t test. Results A total of 301 exams were administered; 86 to PGY1, 88 to PGY2, 86 to PGY3, and 41 to PGY4 residents. The testing of didactic knowledge before and after the GEMC educational intervention had high internal reliability (87.9%). The intervention significantly improved scores in all 7 GEMC domains (improvement 13.5% to 34.6%; p<0.001). For all questions, the improvement was 23% (37.8% pre, 60.8% post; P<0.001) Graded increase in geriatric knowledge occurred by PGY year with the greatest improvement post intervention seen at the PGY 3 level (PGY1 19.1% versus PGY3 27.1%). Conclusion A brief GEMC intervention had a significant impact on EM resident knowledge of critical geriatric topics. Lectures based on the GEMC can be a high-yield tool to enhance resident knowledge of geriatric emergency care. Formal GEMC curriculum should be considered in training EM residents for the demands of an aging population.",18.9061164309155

The type of research used in this research is quantitative research with correlational methods. The population in this study were all 65 students of class VII at SMP Negeri 4 Maniamolo. The sampling technique uses a total sampling technique, meaning that the entire population is used as a sample. The instrument in this study used a closed questionnaire and students' science learning outcomes were in the form of odd semester final exam scores. Data analysis techniques were carried out by describing the data, correlational analysis, coefficient of determination and hypothesis testing. The test results in this study indicate that there is a positive and significant relationship between learning interest on science learning outcomes, and there is also an influence between learning interest on Integrated Science learning outcomes. So it was concluded that 1) because students have a sense of pleasure, interest, and a high desire for learning which is seen as giving them benefits and satisfaction, 2) students have a sense of comfort, are aware of the benefits of learning, and know the learning goals that make them interested so that learning occurs. improvement in learning outcomes.","This study aims to determine a positive and significant relationship as well as an influence between students' interest in learning and their mathematics learning outcomes. The research method used in this study is quantitative research with a correlational approach. The population in this study consists of all eighth-grade students at SMP Negeri 1 Toma, totaling 65 students. The sampling technique used is total sampling, meaning the entire population is used as the sample. The instruments in this study include closed-ended questionnaires and students' mathematics learning outcomes in the form of even semester final exam scores (UKK). Data analysis techniques involve describing the data, correlational analysis, coefficient of determination, and hypothesis testing. The results of this study show that there is a positive and significant relationship between students' interest in learning and their mathematics learning outcomes, and there is also an influence of students' interest in learning on their mathematics learning outcomes. It can be concluded that 1) because students have a sense of enjoyment, interest, and a high desire to learn that they perceive as beneficial and satisfying, and 2) students feel comfortable, are aware of the benefits of learning, and understand the learning objectives, which makes them interested and leads to an improvement in learning outcomes.","We tested the hypothesis that highly structured course designs, which implement reading quizzes and/or extensive in-class active-learning activities and weekly practice exams, can lower failure rates in an introductory biology course for majors, compared with low-structure course designs that are based on lecturing and a few high-risk assessments. We controlled for 1) instructor effects by analyzing data from quarters when the same instructor taught the course, 2) exam equivalence with new assessments called the Weighted Bloom's Index and Predicted Exam Score, and 3) student equivalence using a regression-based Predicted Grade. We also tested the hypothesis that points from reading quizzes, clicker questions, and other “practice” assessments in highly structured courses inflate grades and confound comparisons with low-structure course designs. We found no evidence that points from active-learning exercises inflate grades or reduce the impact of exams on final grades. When we controlled for variation in student ability, failure rates were lower in a moderately structured course design and were dramatically lower in a highly structured course design. This result supports the hypothesis that active-learning exercises can make students more skilled learners and help bridge the gap between poorly prepared students and their better-prepared peers.","Teacher education programs are often accused of lacking intellectual rigor and failing to cultivate the competencies their graduates will need. Using data from the National Survey of Student Engagement, Mr. Carini and Mr. Kuh find that the educational experiences of future teachers compare favorably with those of other students in college. However, these positive experiences do not necessarily stem from teacher education programs. SOONER OR LATER, discussions of schooling turn to teacher quality. Both educational leaders and the general public agree that high-quality teachers are a key to boosting student achievement.1 Why might we not have the high-quality teachers we need? Two reasons dominate the debate. The first is self-selection -- the academic ability of those who choose to teach is thought to be a cut (or more) below that of peers headed to other vocations. Second, teacher preparation programs supposedly lack intellectual rigor and don't cultivate certain critical skills and competencies in their students. Though the evidence supporting these claims is far from conclusive,2 universities and policy makers seem determined to upgrade teacher quality. One popular approach is to raise the bar for entry into teacher preparation programs by requiring higher minimum college grades or higher scores on entrance exams. This strategy recalls the specious criteria used in many annual rankings of colleges and universities in which higher scores on such input measures as entrance tests and more resources for faculty salaries or in an endowment yield higher ""quality"" rankings for the university. The public remains mesmerized by such ranking schemes, despite decades of research on college-level learning that point to a very different conclusion. Indeed, studies show that what matters far more to learning and a host of other desired outcomes during college is what students do with their time and how they use the institution's educational resources, not the test scores they bring to college or the resources a school has. Equally important, scores on college entrance tests and even such outcome measures as the Praxis I and II exams don't tell us what we should focus on to enhance teacher preparation, because it isn't clear which institutional policies or practices affect the outcomes of interest. Looking Behind Test Scores and Outcomes The best predictor of learning and personal development for college students is the amount of time and energy they expend on educationally fruitful activities.3 For example, the more students study or practice, the more they learn or the better they become at something. How can we find out whether students are doing these and other productive activities during college? Process indicators are one potentially instructive source of information. These are measures that represent effective educational practices -- student and institutional behaviors that theory and research show are empirically linked to desired outcomes.4 The argument goes like this: future teachers who are challenged more academically during college or who have considerable firsthand experience in educationally meaningful pursuits, such as active and collaborative learning or classes that demand the use of higher-order thinking skills, will tend to be more effective teachers after college because they will learn more during college and will be well positioned to use similar strategies in their own teaching.5 Consider service learning, which is linked to a host of desirable outcomes.6 If we think of service learning as ""a teaching strategy that connects community service with the curriculum,""7 it stands to reason that teachers who've had this experience during college will be better prepared to use this and allied instructional strategies in their own classrooms when they begin teaching. If teacher education programs had valid, reliable process indicators, then faculty members and others could diagnose in which areas prospective teachers were underperforming relative to established standards or compared with their peers in other fields. …","The introduction of computer-based testing in high-stakes examining in higher education is developing rather slowly due to institutional barriers (the need of extra facilities, ensuring test security) and teacher and student acceptance. From the existing literature it is unclear whether computer-based exams will result in similar results as paper-based exams and whether student acceptance can change as a result of administering computer-based exams. In this study, we compared results from a computer-based and paper-based exam in a sample of psychology students and found no differences in total scores across the two modes. Furthermore, we investigated student acceptance and change in acceptance of computer-based examining. After taking the computer-based exam, fifty percent of the students preferred paper-and-pencil exams over computer-based exams and about a quarter preferred a computer-based exam. We conclude that computer-based exam total scores are similar as paper-based exam scores, but that for the acceptance of high-stakes computer-based exams it is important that students practice and get familiar with this new mode of test administration.","Traditional and online university courses share expectations for quality content and rigor. Student and faculty concerns about compromised academic integrity and actual instances of academic dishonesty in assessments, especially with online testing, are increasingly troublesome. Recent research suggests that in the absence of proctoring, the time taken to complete an exam increases significantly and online test results are inflated. This study uses a randomized design in seven sections of an online course to examine test scores from 97 students and time taken to complete online tests with and without proctoring software, controlling for exam difficulty, course design, instructor effects, and student majors. Results from fixed effects estimated from a fitted statistical model showed a significant advantage in quiz performance (7-9 points on a 100 point quiz) when students were not proctored, with all other variables statistically accounted for. Larger grade disparities and longer testing times were observed on the most difficult quizzes, and with factors that reflected the perception of high stakes of the quiz grades. Overall, use of proctoring software resulted in lower quiz scores, shorter quiz taking times, and less variation in quiz performance across exams, implying greater compliance with academic integrity compared with when quizzes were taken without proctoring software.","This study aims to determine the achievement level in each competency given to students and to know the average percentage of post-e-learning student scores. The research method used is quantitative with descriptive statistical techniques. This research population is sports education students 2017, 2018, and 2019 active students, with a sample of 10% of the population. The determination of this sample is based on purposive sampling. Data collection techniques using test instruments, in the form of questions and semester exam results. The research data analysis technique uses descriptive statistical methods obtained during the 2019-2020 semester, namely the Final Semester Examination value. After feeling that it is sufficient to obtain data and process, it will get the research results after feeling that it is enough to get the data and processed to get the research results. The results of the study found that effective learning was seen from 83% of students getting course scores with an average of above 75 at the time of the final even semester examinations in 2019-2020, and it can be concluded that the effectiveness of e-learning in Sports Education students at the Indonesian Technocrat University was successful. With a student passing rate above 80%. It is hoped that this e-learning process will be further developed with a better platform for facing future generations where the role of technology is a significant thing in meeting the changing times.","We identify the student characteristics most associated with success in an introductory business statistics class, placing special focus on the relationship between student math skills and course performance, as measured by student grade in the course. To determine which math skills are important for student success, we examine (1) whether the student has taken calculus or business calculus, (2) whether the student has been required to take remedial mathematics, (3) the student's score on a test of very basic mathematical concepts, (4) student scores on the mathematics portion of the ACT exam, and (5) science/reasoning portion of the ACT exam. The score on the science portion of the ACT exam and the math-quiz score are significantly related to performance in an introductory statistics course, as are student GPA and gender. This result is robust across course formats and instructors. These results have implications for curriculum development, course content, and course prerequisites.","Abstract Self-assessment is vital for online learning since it is one of the most essential skills of distance learners. In this respect, the purpose of this study was to understand learners’ self-assessment quiz taking behaviours in an undergraduate level online course. We tried to figure out whether there is a relation between self-assessment quiz taking behaviours and final exam scores or not. In addition, we investigated how self-assessment quiz taking behaviour differs with respect to learner profile. In line with this purpose, 677 students’ 6092 test events across Project Culture course on Sakai CLE LMS were analyzed. For the analysis of the quantitative data, one-way ANOVA, Chi-Square test of independence, independent-samples t-test and descriptive statistics were utilized. The results revealed that learners who attended self-assessment quizzes regularly had higher final exam scores than others who did not attend those quizzes. Also, they were more satisfied with the course than others study field. In addition, learners who attended selfassessment quizzes regularly had a higher degree of perceived learning. However, number of attempts to those quizzes does not have an effect on final exam scores. On the other hand, a statistically significant relationship was found between attempt number and gender in favour of female learners.","Background and Objectives: In recent decades, many studies have been carried out on the importance of Kolb experiential learning theory (ELT) in teaching-learning processes and its effect on learning outcomes. However, some experts have criticized the Kolb theory and argue that there are some ambiguities on the validity of the theory as an important predictor of achievement. This study has been carried out on dental students’ educational achievement in relation to their dominant learning styles based on Kolb theory in Mashhad University of Medical Sciences (Iran). Methods: In a cross sectional study, Kolb Learning Style Inventory (LSI Ver. 3.1) as well as a questionnaire containing students’ demographic data, academic achievement marks including grade point average (GPA), theoretical and practical courses marks, and the comprehensive basic sciences exam (CBSE) scores were administered on a purposive sample of 162 dental students who had passed their comprehensive basic sciences exam. Educational achievement data were analyzed in relation to students’ dominant learning styles, using descriptive and analytical statistics including χ2, Kruskal-Wallis and two-way ANOVA tests. Results: The dominant learning styles of students were Assimilating (53.1%), Converging (24.1%), Diverging (14.2%) and Accommodating (8.6%). Although, the students with Assimilating and Converging learning styles had a better performance on their educational achievement, there was no significant relationship between educational achievement and dominant learning style (P≥0.05). Conclusion: Findings support that the dominant learning style is not exclusively an essential factor to predict educational achievement. Rather, it shows learning preferences of students that may be considered in designing learning opportunities by the teachers.",22.4240823870689
3,"group; student; cours; learn; score; studi; differ; test; signific; control; exam; two; perform; use; result","The “ gender gap ” on various physics conceptual evaluations has been extensively studied. Men ’ s average pretest scores on the Force Concept Inventory and Force and Motion Conceptual Evaluation are 13% higher than women ’ s, and post-test scores are on average 12% higher than women ’ s. This study analyzed the gender differences within the Conceptual Survey of Electricity and Magnetism (CSEM) in which the gender gap has been less well studied and is less consistent. In the current study, data collected from 1407 students (77% men, 23% women) in a calculus-based physics course over ten semesters showed that male students outperformed female students on the CSEM pretest (5%) and post-test (6%). Separate analyses were conducted for qualitative and quantitative problems on lab quizzes and course exams and showed that male students outperformed female students by 3% on qualitative quiz and exam problems. Male and female students performed equally on the quantitative course exam problems. The gender gaps within CSEM post-test scores, qualitative lab quiz scores, and qualitative exam scores were insignificant for students with a CSEM pretest score of 25% or less but grew as pretest scores increased. Structural equation modeling demonstrated that a latent variable, called Conceptual Physics Performance/Non-Quantitative (CPP/NonQnt), orthogonal to quantitative test performance was useful in explaining the differences observed in qualitative performance; this variable was most strongly related to CSEM post-test scores. The CPP/NonQnt of male students was 0.44 standard deviations higher than female students. The CSEM pretest measured CPP/NonQnt much less accurately for women ( R 2 ¼ 4% ) than for men ( R 2 ¼ 17% ). The failure to detect a gender gap for students scoring 25% or less on the pretest suggests that the CSEM instrument itself is not gender biased. The failure to find a performance difference in quantitative test performance while detecting a gap in qualitative performance suggests the qualitative differences do not result from psychological factors such as science anxiety or stereotype threat. DOI: 10.1103/PhysRevPhysEducRes.13.020114","Our previous research Kost et al., Phys. Rev. ST Phys. Educ. Res. 5, 010101 2009 examined gender differences in the first-semester, introductory physics class at the University of Colorado at Boulder. We found that: 1 there were gender differences in several aspects of the course, including conceptual survey performance, 2 these differences persisted despite the use of interactive engagement techniques, and 3 the post-test gender differences could largely be attributed to differences in males’ and females’ prior physics and math performance and their incoming attitudes and beliefs. In the current study, we continue to characterize gender differences in our physics courses by examining the second-semester, electricity and magnetism course. We analyze three factors: student retention from Physics 1 to Physics 2, student performance, and students’ attitudes and beliefs about physics, and find gender differences in all three of these areas. Specifically, females are less likely to stay in the physics major than males. Despite males and females performing about equally on the conceptual pretest, we find that females score about 6 percentage points lower than males on the conceptual post-test. In most semesters, females outperform males on homework and participation, and males outperform females on exams, resulting in course grades of males and females that are not significantly different. In terms of students’ attitudes and beliefs, we find that both males and females shift toward less expertlike beliefs over the course of Physics 2. Shifts are statistically equal for all categories except for the Personal Interest category, where females have more negative shifts than males. A large fraction of the conceptual post-test gender gap up to 60% can be accounted for by differences in males’ and females’ prior physics and math performance and their pre-Physics 2 attitudes and beliefs. Taken together, the results of this study suggest that it is an accumulation of small gender differences over time that may be responsible for the large differences that we observe in physics participation of males and females.","Introduction Collaborative testing is a learning strategy that provides students with the opportunity to learn and practice collaboration. This study aimed to determine the effect of collaborative testing on test performance and retention of course content in nursing students of Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran. Methods This quasi-experimental study was carried out on 84 students enrolled in the course of Medical-Surgical 2 in Spring 2013 and Fall 2013 semesters. The control group consisting of 39 students participated in the first mid-term exam in an individual format. The intervention group, on the other hand, consisted of 45 students who took the test in a two-stage process. The first stage included an individual testing, while the second stage was a collaborative one given in groups of five individuals chosen randomly. Four weeks later, in order to investigate retention of the course content, both groups took part in the second mid-term exam held individually. Results The study findings showed significant difference between the mean scores in the intervention group in the Fall 2013 semester (p=0.001). Besides, a statistically significant difference was found between the two groups regarding the tests mean scores (p=0.001). Moreover, retention of course content improved in the collaborative group (p=0.001). Conclusion The results indicated an increase in test performance and a long-term learning enhancement in collaborative testing compared with the traditional method. Collaborative testing, as an active learning technique and a valuable assessment method, can help nursing instructors provide the alumni with strong problem-solving and critical thinking abilities at healthcare environments.","In this study, it was investigated whether, and to what extent, Web 2.0 technologies, actually Weblogs, can be a suitable instrument for enhancing the practice of distributed learning. In educational settings, which are based on traditional lectures many students begin serious study shortly before the exam. However, from previous empirical research, it is known that the practice of distributed learning is much more conducive to retaining knowledge than that of massed learning. A 2x2 factorial design (within -- repeated measures) with pre-test and post-test in a real life setting was applied; the study lasted for the whole summer term 2007. Participants were N=28 computer science undergraduates of Graz University of Technology. We randomly assigned them to two groups of equal size: The experimental group given the Weblog treatment are referred to as Group W; whereas the control group with no access are referred to as Group C. Students of group W were instructed to use the Weblog for developing their paper and studying during the lecture and they were requested not to reveal their group affiliation. The results showed that performance scores of group W were significantly higher than that of group C. This demonstrates that Weblogs can be an appropriate instrument to supplement a classical lecture in order to enable deeper processing of information over a longer period of time, consequently resulting in enhanced learning performance.","The integrated mechanisms of heart contraction are some of the most complex processes for undergraduate biomedical students to understand. Visual models have the potential to enhance learning environments by providing visual representations of complex mechanisms. Despite their benefits, the use of visual models in undergraduate classrooms is still limited. For this study, we tested the effect of a learning sequence of activities related to the cardiac cycle using an augmented reality (AR) application for smartphones and tablets. We were interested in understanding the ability of students to draw and label figures reflecting cardiac function after experiencing the learning sequence using AR. Undergraduate students of the biomedical sciences (control n = 43, experimental n = 58) were enrolled in the course, and their drawings were evaluated using multiple levels of complexity (1 = basic to 5 = complex) through a pre-/posttest structure that included a learning sequence based on AR in the experimental group and regular lecture-based activities in the control group. The complexity of students' drawings was evaluated on the anatomical, physiological, and molecular aspects of heart contraction. We used Cohen's kappa index for interrater reliability when determining the complexity of drawings. Control and experimental groups showed no differences in baseline knowledge (preexamination quiz). The students who experienced the AR activities showed an increase in the complexity of representation levels in posttest results and also showed a significant difference in scores for the final exam in the heart physiology course. Our results indicate that using AR enhances the comprehension of anatomical and physiological concepts of the cardiac cycle for undergraduate biomedical students.","We have given a group of 56 MIT seniors who took mechanics as freshmen a written test similar to the final exam they took in their freshman course, plus the Mechanics Baseline Test (MBT) and Colorado Learning Attitudes about Science Survey (C-LASS) standard instruments. Students in majors unrelated to physics scored 60% lower on the written analytic part of the final than they did as freshmen. The mean score of all students on conceptual multiple choice questions included on the final declined by approximately 50% relative to the scores of freshmen. The mean score of all participants on the MBT was insignificantly changed from the posttest taken as freshmen. More specifically, however, the students’ performance on 9 of the 26 MBT items (with 6 of the 9 involving graphical kinematics) represents a gain over their freshman pretest score (a normalized gain of about 70%, double the gain achieved in the freshman course alone), while their performance on the remaining 17 questions is best characterized as a loss of approximately 50% of the material learned in the freshman course. Attitudinal survey results indicate that almost half the seniors feel the specific mechanics course content is unlikely to be useful to them, a significant majority (75−85%) feel that physics does teach valuable skills, and an overwhelming majority believe that mechanics should remain a required course at MIT.","Cooperative learning is a student-centered learning method that allows students to collaborate and interact in small groups. The purpose of this study was to identify the effectiveness of the Cooperative Learning Model Jigsaw and Team Games Tournament towards Year Three student’s social skills in Islamic education subjects of hadith. The study was conducted using quantitative methods in the form of quasi experimental studies. The social skills rating scale-teacher (SSRS-T) tests have been tested for their reliability to obtain data on the level of social skills of students. Respondents of the study consisted of a total of 60 national primary school pupils in the district of Nilai, Negeri Sembilan. Respondents consist of 30 students of control group and 30 students of experimental group. Pre-test to test achievement of student’s social skills level before treatment and post test to test effectiveness of treatment were conducted. Descriptive and inference analysis were used to test the study questions using the Statistical Packages for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 23.0. The findings showed that the level of social skills of the treatment group was at a moderate level with a mean score of 3.397 and there was a significant difference in the mean score of social basic skills between the treatment group and the pre group after the post test. This finding is expected to benefit the District Education Office, the State Education Department and the Curriculum Development Division of the Ministry of Education to increase information, to improve the existing Islamic Education pedagogical modules as well as changing the exam oriented pedagogy to skills oriented pedagogy. The enhancement of social basic skills in the aspects of language skills, communication skills and collaborative skills is expected to provide students with satisfaction and happiness.","Undergraduate students struggle to read the scientific literature and educators have suggested that this may reflect deficiencies in their science literacy skills. In this two-year study we develop and test a strategy for using the scientific literature to teach science literacy skills to novice life science majors. The first year of the project served as a preliminary investigation in which we evaluated student science literacy skills, created a set of science literacy learning objectives aligned with Bloom’s taxonomy, and developed a set of homework assignments that used peer-reviewed articles to teach science literacy. In the second year of the project the effectiveness of the assignments and the learning objectives were evaluated. Summative student learning was evaluated in the second year on a final exam. The mean score was 83.5% (±20.3%) and there were significant learning gains (p < 0.05) in seven of nine of science literacy skills. Project data indicated that even though students achieved course-targeted lower-order science literacy objectives, many were deficient in higher-order literacy skills. Results of this project suggest that building scientific literacy is a continuing process which begins in first-year science courses with a set of fundamental skills that can serve the progressive development of literacy skills throughout the undergraduate curriculum.","Introduction: Student-generated questions can be a very helpful tool in medical education. The use of this activity can allow the students to feel more involved in the subjects covered and may improve their knowledge and learning. The aim of this study was to identify the effect of question-writing activity as a stimulus factor on learning in midwifery students and determine their perception about this activity. Methods: This quasi-experimental study with two groups of pre- and post-tests was conducted on two groups of midwifery students who had taken the immunology course. Two classes of midwifery students (N=62) participated and were randomly assigned to two different groups. One class was selected as the experimental group (n=32) and the other class was considered as the control group (n=30). The experimental group’s students were asked to write questions covering different topics of the syllabus components taught during 15 weeks from February 2016 to May 2016. They were asked to write, answer and explain their multiple-choice questions (MCQs). The students’ performance in immunology course was compared between the two groups at the end of the semester. After their final exam, we asked them to fill in a questionnaire on their views about this activity. The data were analyzed by independent t- test using SPSS software, version 18. Results: The differences between pre- and post-test mean scores of the experimental and control groups were 24.53±5.74 and 20.63±5.58, respectively. The results of independent t-test showed that these differences in the two groups were significant (p=0.009). Nevertheless, most of the students stated that question-writing activity as a learning tool is an unfamiliar exercise and unpopular learning strategy. Conclusion: Results showed that question writing by students has been found to promote learning when it is implemented as a part of the teaching curriculum in immunology course; therefore, this activity could be effective in improving the students’ learning.","Objective: The aim of the study was to determine the efficacy of Team-based Learning (TBL) in an undergraduate nursing course with regard to the outcomes of academic performance (Health Education Systems Incorporated [HESI ® ] Management exam) and self-reported measures of critical thinking, leadership and management skills, overall course ratings, accountability to learning, preference for lecture or TBL, and learner satisfaction with TBL. Methods: In a quantitative, quasi-experimental post-test study, 221 undergraduate senior nursing students participated in the TBL course or a traditional instructor-led control course.  In both courses, academic performance was measured by the HESI ® Management scores; critical thinking, leadership and management skills, and overall course experience were measured using an online survey. In the TBL course, accountability to learning, preference for lecture or TBL, and learner satisfaction was measured with the Team-Based Learning Student Assessment Instrument. Results: When compared to lecture, TBL learners scored significantly higher on the HESI ® Management exam and reported significantly higher critical thinking, leadership and management skills and better overall course experience ratings ( p ≤ .01). TBL learners reported moderate to high levels of accountability, higher preference for TBL than lecture, and satisfaction with TBL. Total scores indicated moderate to high levels of favorable experiences with TBL. Conclusions: Results indicate TBL is an acceptable and efficacious instructional strategy in undergraduate nursing students. To control for extraneous factors and limit confounding, future research should evaluate the impact of TBL via a randomized control trial.",20.0459740595579

METHODS In a cross-sectional study, an ad hoc questionnaire was delivered to a sample of BH first-year university students. The following data were collected: socio-demographic features, consumption of neuroenchancing substances, the Westside Test Anxiety Scale (WTAS) and academic performance. RESULTS A total of 214 students were included. Consumption of lifestyle substances, coffee, energy drinks, nicotine, alcohol, and marijuana, for the purpose of neuroenhancement increased during the week before the exams. OTC cognitive enhancer use was reported by 31.0%, and of benzodiazepines by 1.5% of students. No psycostimulants were used. A high to extremely high exam WTAS score was reported in 38.3% students. The exam WTAS score was positively correlated with consumption of coffee (rho=0.31; P<0.001), energy drinks (rho=0.18; P=0.009), and nicotine (rho=0.22; P=0.001), and negatively correlated with last exam grade (rho=-0.33; P<0.001). The exam WTAS score was a significant independent predictor (OR=0.55; 95% CI 0.31 to 0.97, P=0.039) for self-assessed academic performance. Self-assessed academic performance was positively correlated with last exam grade (rho=0.15; P=0.043). CONCLUSIONS Although first-year BH university students do not seem to use either prescription or illicit psycostimulants, the consumption of nicotine, alcohol, and marijuana is worrying. However, the consumption of these neuroenhancing substances seems not to be related to better self-assessed academic performance. Finally, exam anxiety seems to be a significant problem among BH first-year university students.","OBJECTIVES The aim of this study was to assess the psychological health of first-year health professional students and to study sources of student stress. METHODS All first-year students (N = 125) of the Gulf Medical University (GMU) in Ajman, United Arab Emirates (UAE), were invited to participate in a voluntary, anonymous, self-administered, questionnaire-based survey in January 2011. Psychological health was assessed using the 12-item General Health Questionnaire. A 24-item questionnaire, with items related to academic, psychosocial and health domains was used to identify sources of stress. Pearson's chi-squared test and the Mann-Whitney U-test were used for testing the association between psychological morbidity and sources of stress. RESULTS A total of 112 students (89.6%) completed the survey and the overall prevalence of psychological morbidity was found to be 33.6%. The main academic-related sources of stress were 'frequency of exams', 'academic workload', and 'time management'. Major psychosocial stressors were 'worries regarding future', 'high parental expectations', 'anxiety', and 'dealing with members of the opposite sex'. Health-related issues were 'irregular eating habits', 'lack of exercise', and 'sleep-related problems'. Psychological morbidity was not significantly associated with any of the demographic factors studied. However, total stress scores and academics-related domain scores were significantly associated with psychological morbidity. CONCLUSION Psychological morbidity was seen in one in three first-year students attending GMU. While worries regarding the future and parental expectations were sources of stress for many students, psychological morbidity was found to be significantly associated with only the total stress and the academic-related domain scores.","Objectives The study objectives were to identify the stress levels and to explore the impact of students' year of study and gender on the perceived sources of stress among Malaysian dental students. Methods This was a cross-sectional study involving dental students from year one to year five from private and public universities in Malaysia. The study was formally approved by the Research and Ethics Committee, International Medical University Malaysia. Dental Environment Stress (DES) questionnaire was used for data collection and the gathered data were analyzed using SPSS® version 18. The Kruskal-Wallis and the Mann-Whitney U tests were used to compare stress items across various academic years and universities. Results A total of five hundred and twenty nine (529) students participated in this study. Fear of failing the course at the end of year exams (mean stress level=5.57); concerns regarding completion of clinical work (mean=5.30); and examination results and grades (mean=5.27) were found as top stressors among dental students. Female students had higher stress scores than males with respect to personal issues, academic performance, educational environment and learning of clinical skills. Students from public universities had higher stress scores than their counterparts from private universities. Conclusion The Malaysian dental students reported higher levels of stress. Present study identified stressors affecting dental students' academic life, and highlights the importance of stress management programs and other measures to minimize the impact of stress on both academic and personal lives of the students.","Background: Identification of the potential sources of stress is important in dental education program, as it gives opportunity to take various measures to prevent stress in the dental school environment. The purpose of the present study was to address various sources of stress among dental school students and its relation with gender and year of the study. Materials and Methods: A questionnaire based cross-sectional study was conducted among 3 rd and 4 th year students of a dental school. Questionnaire used in the study comprised the modified version of the questionnaire used in Dental Environmental Stress. A four-point Likert scale was used to record the responses from the subjects. A total of 174 subjects participated in the study. Statistical analysis was done using SPSS package version 16. Results: Of the participants, 39% (68) were males and 61% (106) were females. Majority of students felt stressed about academic performance, clinic/patient related stress, and career related stress. Top stressors in academic performance related stress were exam and grade stress (95%), followed by fear of failing (90.5%), lack of time between tests/clinics, and criticism at work (94%). Mean stress scores were significantly related to year and gender of students. Conclusion: Worries about fulfilling clinical requirements, academics, exam stress, and insecurity regarding career were the major sources of stress reported by the clinical year dental students in the present study.","As adolescents spend the majority of their time focused on exams and assignments, they do not have sufficient time to engage in physical activity; this lack of physical activity is an important public health concern. This study aimed to investigate how school-based physical activity programs affect the health-related physical fitness of adolescents in the Republic of Korea. For this study, a total of 120 high school students participated in a school-based physical activity program that included badminton and table tennis for 15 weeks each (35 min/day, three times a week), with a total of 30 weeks for one academic year. The parameters for health-related physical fitness measured muscle strength (handgrip strength), power (standing long jump), cardiorespiratory fitness (shuttle run test), flexibility (sit and reach), body mass index (BMI), and the total score. The results revealed a statistically significant improvement in muscle strength (p < 0.001), power (p < 0.001), cardiorespiratory fitness (p < 0.001), flexibility (p = 0.005), and the overall health-related physical fitness score (p = 0.001). However, students’ BMI showed no significant difference before and after participation (p = 0.825). The results of this study indicated that school-based physical activity programs can have a positive effect on the health-related physical fitness of adolescents.","OBJECTIVE: Stress is a condition caused by various factors and characterized by imbalance in body functioning, impair in nervous system, and tension. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of cortisol level, which increases in healthy young individuals due to stress, on dynamic and static balance scores as well as to present the results caused by high levels of stress. METHODS: In this study, 107 healthy medicine faculty students in their second year (who will take the same committee exam) aged between 19 and 23 years were included. The first balance measurements and saliva samples were taken 40 days before the committee exam, and this period was acknowledged as the relaxed period. The same students were considered for balance measurements again on the day of committee exam; saliva samples were collected, and cortisol concentration was determined. This period was acknowledged as the stressful period. The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) was given to the participants in their relaxed and stressful periods. Dynamic balance scores were measured with Star Excursion Balance Test (SEBT). Static balance scores were measured with One Leg Standing Balance Test (OLSBT). RESULTS: The mean cortisol level was found to increase approximately 9 times in stressful periods compared with that in relaxed periods. STAI, which shows state anxiety, showed an increase supporting this increase. In stressful periods, dynamic balance scores showed obvious decrease in all directions. In addition, in stressful periods, an obvious decrease was observed in static balance scores compared with those in relaxed periods. CONCLUSION: This study showed that stress negatively affected dynamic and static balance, even for short periods of time. We believe that our study will form a positive source and basis when correlated with long terms stress and balance measurements.","We study the effect of the Israeli–Palestinian conflict on various education outcomes for Palestinian high school students in the West Bank during the Second Intifada (2000–2006). Exploiting within-school variation in the number of conflict-related Palestinian fatalities during the academic year, we show that the conflict reduces the probability of passing the final exam, the total test score, and the probability of being admitted to university. The effect of conflict varies with the type and the timing of the violent events the student is exposed to and it is not significant for students in the upper tail of the test score distribution. We discuss various possible transmission mechanisms explaining our main result. Evidence suggests a role for both the conflict-induced deterioration of school infrastructures and the worsening in the student's psychological well-being due to direct exposure to violent events.","Abstract Introduction: All medical schools in Saudi Arabia have English as the primary official medium of instruction. Most of the high school education, however, is delivered in Arabic and hence the transition to an English based learning environment tends to be difficult for some students. Our study aims to correlate English language proficiency with academic performance among medical students in their preparatory year. Methods: A cross-sectional study design was used. Test scores of 103 preparatory year students (54 female and 49 male) were analyzed after the students completed an English language course and medical introductory course in their preparatory year. The total score obtained in the English course assessment was compared to each component of the medical content assessment. Results: A significantly positive correlation (Spearman's Rho, at 0.01 levels) was seen between the scores of the English exam and the written exam (P<0.001) and the oral exam (P = −0.003) parts respectively of the medical examination. Significant correlation with the English exam score was not obtained for the other components of the medical assessment, namely; student assignments, presentations and portfolios. Conclusion: English language proficiency is an important factor in determining academic proficiency of medical students in our college at the preparatory year level.","Sir, Assessment of learning has always been a difficult, yet an essential component of an educational program. In the undergraduate medical education system in India, curricular guidelines of Medical Council of India lay emphasis on methods of assessment of knowledge and skills in pharmacology.[1] Although continuous formative assessment constitutes an integral part in the curriculum, the ‘pass’ and the ‘fail’ certificates are based to a great extent on students’ performance in the final summative examination. The final examination consists of written papers, viva-voce sessions and practical exercises. Written examination consists of two papers. Each paper has the maximum marks of 40 and contains structured essay type questions and short notes. In viva-voce examination, each student is assessed by five examiners; two of them external examiners and the others internal examiners. In order to pass, a candidate must obtain 50% marks in aggregate with a minimum of 50% marks in written and viva together and a minimum of 50% marks in practical examination.[1] The written examination is a useful evaluation format that not only tests students’ ability to recall facts, but also can assess higher-order cognitive functions, such as interpretation of data and problem solving skills. The viva-voce examination on the other hand is a general encounter between a candidate and one or more examiners.[2] Viva-voce examinations are less reliable as they are essentially subjective in nature, afflicted with ‘halo effects’, errors of central tendency, a general tendency toward leniency, and errors of contrast.[2] Examiners mostly indulge in over-marking in viva-voce examinations in order to make an otherwise undeserving candidate ‘pass’. We explored this recently in a small questionnaire-based interview among examiners of pharmacology in one university and the examiners admitted showing such ‘leniency’. Against this backdrop, we planned the present study to compare students’ performance in written and viva-voce components of the final summative pharmacology examination in MBBS curriculum in order to have a critical insight into the two modes of evaluation, the way they are practiced. This was a record-based observational study done in a medical college in India that also served as an examination centre for second professional MBBS examination in pharmacology for four consecutive years, from 2008 to 2011. The performance of students was assessed. Permission for access to the students’ score sheets was obtained from appropriate authority and confidentiality of individual student’s score was maintained. Percentage of marks obtained by four batches of students (n=589), in consecutive years (2008-11), in written and viva-voce components of the final summative examination in pharmacology were reviewed: Batch 1 (Jan 2011 Exam, n=159), Batch 2 (Jan 2010 Exam, n=139), Batch 3 (Jan 2009 Exam, n=148), Batch 4 (Jan 2008 Exam, n=143). Based on their performance in terms of percentage of marks in aggregate, all students in a batch were classified into four categories viz., ‘failed’(F) – <50%, ‘borderline passed’ (BP) – 50-57%, ‘passed’ (P) – >57% to <75% and ‘passed with distinction’ (PD) – ≥75%. Correlation was assessed between the percentage of marks obtained by students in these categories in written vis-a-vis viva-voce examination. Highly significant association was observed in marks obtained by students in P and PD categories in all four batches in viva-voce and written examination (P<0.001). However, no significant association was observed in marks obtained by students in F and BP categories in all four batches in viva-voce and written examination (P>0.05). The results are shown in Table 1. Interestingly, no student in F category got 50% marks in written examination, but most of them scored satisfactorily in the viva-voce. Among all the students in F category, three students in 2008, five in 2009, four in 2010 and none in 2011 failed in practical examination. The number of students in each category (e.g., F, BP, P and PD) when compared among the 4 years (2008-11) did not show any significant difference [Figure 1]. Our study showed that there was highly significant association between written and viva-voce marks of students in the PD and P categories (P<0.001). We interpret this as the ‘true’ reflection of knowledge and competence of the students in this category. Our study also revealed that there was a lack of significant association in performance in written and viva-voce examination among students in F and BP categories (P>0.05). Marks obtained by students in viva-voce were higher with respect to those in written examination in these two categories. Rather, the poorer the performance in written examination, the higher the marks obtained in the viva-voce. Such trend is most prominent in the F category of students Access this article online","Background Medical students face greater academic stress and devote more time to their studies due to the tough nature of medical education, at the cost of sleep and physical activity. Good sleep quality and physical activity improve the mental ability and academic performance of the students. Objectives and rationale The study aims to assess sleep quality and physical activity levels among fourth-year MBBS students of Rawalpindi Medical University. We compare these levels with gender and boarding status and correlate them with the academic performance of the students. This may provide new target areas to improve the academics of students performing below average. Materials and methods It was a descriptive, cross-sectional study conducted in March 2019 on 344 medical students enrolled in the fourth-year MBBS class of Rawalpindi Medical University. Sleep quality was assessed by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), physical activity levels by the Global Physical Activity Questionnaire (GPAQ), and academic performance by the marks attained in the most recent pathology class test. The students who could not prepare for the test in the usual manner were excluded from the study. Two-hundred nineteen (219) students were part of the final study sample. Data analysis was performed using SPSS v.22.0 (IBM Corp, Armonk, NY, US). A chi-squared test, independent samples t-test, Pearson’s correlation, and a multiple linear regression model were used to assess the variables. Results Sleep quality and physical activity were significantly correlated with academic performance (p-values of the chi-square and t-test were <0.000). Pearson’s correlation coefficient was -0.69 for PSQI (p<0.000) and 0.62 for GPAQ (p 0.003) with test scores. Gender showed significant association with sleep and physical activity levels (male students had better physical activity level and poorer sleep quality than female students) but no association with test scores. Boarding status was significantly associated with all three variables. Boarders had lower mean test scores and poorer sleep and physical activity indices as compared to non-boarders. The multiple linear regression model was valid (p-value of the F test was <0.000), with beta coefficients of -2.53 ( p=0.002) for sleep quality and 1.37 (p=0.01) for physical activity. The R2 value was 0.84 (84%). Conclusions Our study indicates an overall poor sleep quality and physical activity level among fourth-year medical students, particularly boarding students, who have lower test scores and worse sleep and physical activity levels. In general, male students have better GPAQ scores and female students have better PSQI scores. Both the PSQI and GPAQ scores are significantly correlated with test scores and provide potential target areas to improve the exam performance of the students.",15.5993898127218

Illustrations on paper were replaced by carousels full of photographic slides, which in turn have been supplanted by Powerpoint™ presentations. At an arguably much slower pace, the method of teaching microscopic anatomy to students of the healthcare professions is also changing. For the majority of medical students graduating before 2000, the microscope and accompanying boxes of glass slides were the standard tools for learning both histology and pathology. Studying for exams also included reviewing kodachromes showing static fields-of-view at predetermined magnifications. Both of these methods of learning required the student to be physically present on campus. Pathology residents, when not learning at the microscope with the attending pathologist, must rely on teaching sets of glass slides that cannot leave the department. Group learning must either be done at a multiheaded microscope (which many times has fewer heads than people present) or by use of video technology attached to the microscope. With the advent of digital whole slide imaging (WSI) over the past several years, there is an opportunity to revolutionize the way teaching and learning are done for all students of medicine including doctors, nurses, medical technicians, histology technicians, cytology technicians, and others. Comparison of Digital Whole Slide Images with Glass Slides There are many advantages to using WSI when compared with traditional glass slides [Table 1]. Digital images can be standardized; all students will study the exact same tissue section. Sections on glass slides are inherently variable in quality and content.[1] Although admittedly subtle in some cases, these variabilities can be eliminated with digital imaging. The quality of the image can also be indefinitely maintained compared to glass slides that are vulnerable to fading, breaking, and vanishing.[2] One very helpful aspect of digital images is the use of a thumbnail image. As students are examining the image at higher magnification, they can always refer to the thumbnail for orientation.[3] This obviously is impossible with glass slides. Glass slides cannot be easily annotated with any precision, relying on relatively crude “dotting” for the purposes of highlighting a certain area of the slide. Digital images can have multiple annotations including arrows, circles, text, etc. placed exactly where needed. Portability is another benefit of using digital images. The use of microscopes obligates a student to remain on campus in order to study, review, etc. With WSI loaded onto a web-based server, study can occur wherever and whenever the student wishes.[2] WSI also makes simultaneous viewing of a particular field-of-view possible; a major advantage over glass slides. Viewing the image on a common computer monitor encourages discussion and collaboration between classmates.[1] Finally, storage of WSI becomes a matter of having enough server memory. As server space becomes less and less expensive, the cost and effort of storing and maintaining both the microscopes and glass slide sets will become comparatively more burdensome.[3] Some disadvantages that have become apparent with WSI include the dependence of the image quality on monitor resolution and the challenge of scanning tissue sections that have artifacts such as folds, etc.[3] Judicious choice of an acceptable non-cost prohibitive monitor is essential for an accurate image. As digital scanners become “smarter”, the flaws in a slide will likely become less of an issue. Table 1 Benefits of digital slide imaging Educational Applications of Digital Whole Slide Imaging The educational applications for this technology are growing. Histology and pathology laboratories and small group study sessions are the early opportunities for medical student use either in a formal computer laboratory or via personal laptops. For those students choosing a pathology residency, WSI can be used for didactic lectures and unknown conferences. Independent study can be encouraged and facilitated with the use of organ-system-based teaching sets, of both neoplastic and non-neoplastic diseases. Diagnostic skills can also be assessed with WSI exams. One academic center looked at the reliability of WSI for measuring resident competency. Using a set of 20 questions based upon 20 whole slide images, junior and senior residents were tested. They determined that the correlation between exam score and months of training was high, the correlation with the resident in-service examination (RISE) was not quite as high, and that the exam could reliably discriminate between junior and senior residents.[4] WSI can also be used for teaching residents or fellows in clinical fields. For pathologists in either academic or non-academic medical centers, WSI can be implemented into both teaching and working interdepartmental conferences such as tumor boards and biopsy conferences (renal, liver, transplant, etc.). For the established pathologist, WSI has become a convenient method of acquiring continuing medical education credits offered through national pathology organization websites. Additional uses for WSI including the creation of electronic books will certainly evolve over time.","This paper presents three experiments to assess the impact of gamifying an audience response system on the perceptions and educational performance of students. An audience response system called SIDRA (Immediate Audience Response System in Spanish) and two audience response systems with gamification features, R-G-SIDRA (gamified SIDRA with ranking) and RB-G-SIDRA (gamified SIDRA with ranking and badges), were used in a General and Descriptive Human Anatomy course. Students participated in an empirical study. In the academic year 2019–2020, a total of 90 students used RB-G-SIDRA, 90 students employed R-G-SIDRA in the academic year 2018–2019, and 92 students used SIDRA in the academic year 2017–2018. Statistically significant differences were found between final exam grades obtained by using RB-G-SIDRA and SIDRA, U = 39.211 adjusted p = 0.001 and RB-G-SIDRA and R-G-SIDRA U = 31.157 adjusted p = 0.015, thus finding strong evidence with respect to the benefit of the badges used in RB-G-SIDRA. Moreover, in the students’ SIDRA systems scores, statistically significant differences were found between RB-G-SIDRA and SIDRA, U = −90.521 adjusted p < 0.001, and between R-G-SIDRA and SIDRA, U = −87.998 adjusted p < 0.001. Significant correlations between individual and team scores were also found in all of the tests in RB-G-SIDRA and G-SIDRA. The students expressed satisfaction, engagement, and motivation with SIDRA, R-G-SIDRA, and RB-G-SIDRA, thus obtaining a final average assessment of 4.28, 4.61, and 4.47 out of 5, respectively. Students perform better academically with gamified versus non-gamified audience response systems. Findings can be used to build a gamified adaptive learning system.","Assessment Test is one of the routine agenda that is carried out every semester change. This test is conducted to see the development of students in learning activities. Currently SMK 5 Kota Tangerang already uses a mobile application using the PENTAS application in answering the exam questions. But this application needs to be done to understand applications that can be used properly, or vice versa. This study uses the System Usability Scale (SUS) method to measure the use of this application for use. This SUS method has 10 questions that will be answered by respondents who are directly involved in using the PENTAS application. The average score obtained by the System Use Scale method is 46.00. These results fall into the Unacceptable category, so this PENTAS application is not good for use.","Abstract Background : Small-group case presentation exercises (CPs) were created to increase course relevance for medical students taking Medical Microbiology (MM) and Infectious Diseases (ID) Methods : Each student received a unique paper case and had 10 minutes to review patient history, physical exam data, and laboratory data. Students then had three minutes to orally present their case and defend why they ruled in or out each of the answer choices provided, followed by an additional three minutes to answer questions. Results : Exam scores differed significantly between students who received the traditional lecture-laboratory curriculum (Group I) and students who participated in the CPs (Group II). In MM, median unit exam and final exam scores for Group I students were 84.4% and 77.8%, compared to 86.0% and 82.2% for Group II students (P < 0.018; P < 0.001; Mann-Whitney Rank Sum Test). Median unit and final ID exam scores for Group I students were 84.0% and 80.0%, compared to 88.0% and 86.7% for Group II students (P < 0.001; P < 0.001). Conclusion : Students felt that the CPs improved their critical thinking and presentation skills and helped to prepare them as future physicians.","Background Shortage of human resources, increasing educational costs, and the need to keep social distances in response to the COVID-19 worldwide outbreak have prompted the necessity of clinical training methods designed for distance learning. Virtual patient simulators (VPSs) may partially meet these needs. Natural language processing (NLP) and intelligent tutoring systems (ITSs) may further enhance the educational impact of these simulators. Objective The goal of this study was to develop a VPS for clinical diagnostic reasoning that integrates interaction in natural language and an ITS. We also aimed to provide preliminary results of a short-term learning test administered on undergraduate students after use of the simulator. Methods We trained a Siamese long short-term memory network for anamnesis and NLP algorithms combined with Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine (SNOMED) ontology for diagnostic hypothesis generation. The ITS was structured on the concepts of knowledge, assessment, and learner models. To assess short-term learning changes, 15 undergraduate medical students underwent two identical tests, composed of multiple-choice questions, before and after performing a simulation by the virtual simulator. The test was made up of 22 questions; 11 of these were core questions that were specifically designed to evaluate clinical knowledge related to the simulated case. Results We developed a VPS called Hepius that allows students to gather clinical information from the patient’s medical history, physical exam, and investigations and allows them to formulate a differential diagnosis by using natural language. Hepius is also an ITS that provides real-time step-by-step feedback to the student and suggests specific topics the student has to review to fill in potential knowledge gaps. Results from the short-term learning test showed an increase in both mean test score (P<.001) and mean score for core questions (P<.001) when comparing presimulation and postsimulation performance. Conclusions By combining ITS and NLP technologies, Hepius may provide medical undergraduate students with a learning tool for training them in diagnostic reasoning. This may be particularly useful in a setting where students have restricted access to clinical wards, as is happening during the COVID-19 pandemic in many countries worldwide.","Background: Simulation in medical education provides students with opportunities to practice interviews, examinations, and diagnosis formulation related to complex conditions without risks to patients. Aim: To examine differences between individual and team participation on learning outcomes and student perspectives through use of virtual patients (VPs) for teaching cranial nerve (CN) evaluation. Methods: Fifty-seven medical students were randomly assigned to complete simulation exercises either as individuals or as members of three-person teams. Students interviewed, examined, and diagnosed VPs with possible CN damage in the Neurological Exam Rehearsal Virtual Environment (NERVE). Knowledge of CN abnormalities was assessed pre- and post-simulation. Student perspectives of system usability were evaluated post-simulation. Results: An aptitude-treatment interaction (ATI) effect was detected; at pre-test scores ≤ 50%, students in teams scored higher (83%) at post-test than did students as individuals (62%, p = 0.02). Post-simulation, students in teams reported greater confidence in their ability to diagnose CN abnormalities than did students as individuals (p = 0.02; mean rating = 4.0/5.0 and 3.4/5.0, respectively). Conclusion: The ATI effect allows us to begin defining best practices for the integration of VP simulators into the medical curriculum. We are persuaded to implement future NERVE exercises with small teams of medical students.","Objective The aim of using the game-based tool Kahoot! was to evaluate and reinforce the contents taught in the subject of Management and Administration of Nursing, Ethics and Health Legislation Services included in the Degree in Nursing, during the 2016–2017 academic year. Methods A prospective quasi-experimental study was carried out on a sample of 116 students. 10 multiple-choice questions were designed, with only one possible correct answer and a 20-second-limited response time for each of the questions. Four of these questions previously answered in the classroom using this game were chosen (20% of the exam). Each one of them corresponded to one unit of the topics taught in the subject. In order to participate in the educational game, students needed their smartphones or electronic devices. After completing the game, the students’ satisfaction level derived from its use was assessed. Results The correct answer rate in the educational game was greater than 50% for all questions except for one, in which the rate was 28.8% (P<0.05). Response time as related to score presented statistically significant differences, and higher scores for those questions with lower response time (P<0.001). The questions included in the final test which had been previously answered using Kahoot! showed a significantly higher difficulty index than the rest of the final exam questions (P<0.05). Question 3 was the easiest, while being the one in which the highest-scoring students obtained more wrong answers. For the students this tool was easy to use (89.6%) and they positively valued the content acquisition and comprehension, as well as the teacher-student interaction (P<0.05). Conclusion The implementation of educational games which consider response time and correct answers favors competitiveness and motivates students to actively participate in their learning process.","This study was designed to measure students’ voluntary use of retrieval practice as a review tool. Students who used test-based reviews scored higher on exams than students who used reading-based reviews. Showing students exam performance associated with test- vs. reading-based reviews coincided with a significant increase in use of test-based reviews.","Objectives To assess illness script richness and maturity in preclinical students after they attended a specifically structured instructional format, i.e., a case based clinical reasoning (CBCR) course. Methods In a within-subject experimental design, medical students who had finished the CBCR course participated in an illness script experiment. In the first session, richness and maturity of students’ illness scripts for diseases discussed during the CBCR course were compared to illness script richness and maturity for similar diseases not included in the course. In the second session, diagnostic performance was tested, to test for differences between CBCR cases and non-CBCR cases. Scores on the CBCR course exam were related to both experimental outcomes. Results Thirty-two medical students participated. Illness script richness for CBCR diseases was almost 20% higher than for non-CBCR diseases, on average 14.47 (SD=3.25) versus 12.14 (SD=2.80), respectively (p<0.001). In addition, students provided more information on Enabling Conditions and less on Fault-related aspects of the disease. Diagnostic performance was better for the diseases discussed in the CBCR course, mean score 1.63 (SD=0.32) versus 1.15 (SD=0.29) for non-CBCR diseases (p<0.001). A significant correlation of exam results with recognition of CBCR cases was found (r=0.571, p<0.001), but not with illness script richness (r=–0.006, p=NS). Conclusions The CBCR-course fosters early development of clinical reasoning skills by increasing the illness script richness and diagnostic performance of pre-clinical students. However, these results are disease-specific and therefore we cannot conclude that students develop a more general clinical reasoning ability.","Introduction: In traditional medical education systems much interest is placed on the cramming of basic and clinical facts without considering their applicability in the future professional career. The aim of this study is to evaluate a novice medical training method (problem-based learning) as compared to the contemporary teacher-based medical education or traditional methods. Methods: Selection of the study subjects was done through simple sampling and according to the division of medical students introduced from Medical Faculty to the Pediatrics Department with no personal involvement. 120 medical students were assigned to 8 groups of 15 students each. For four months, 4 groups were trained with traditional method and 4 other groups underwent problem-based learning method on selected subject materials. In each method, a pre-course test at the beginning and a post-course test at the end of each course were given to each group. The questionnaire used in this study as the instrument was composed of 39 questions, 37 multiple choice questions and two short answer questions. Three professors of pediatric gastroenterologist took part in the training. Two of these professors were responsible for solving task training method. The third professor used traditional teacher-centered methodology to eliminate any possible bias. Scores obtained from these tests were analyzed using paired t-test and independent t-test. P-values of less than 0.05 were considered as significant. Results: The scores of the students undergoing the traditional method were 14.70±3.03 and 21.20±4.07 in the first and second test, respectively. In problem-based learning, the scores were 15.82±3.29 in the first and 27.52±4.72 in the second test. There was a significant difference between the mean scores of post-course exams of the two groups (p=0.001), while no significant difference was observed between the mean scores of pre-course exams of the groups (p=0.550). Conclusion: It may be concluded that problem-based learning method leads to a significant increase in learning and recalling output compared to the traditional method. Given the evolving medical education in the country's medical schools toward problem-based learning, it is suggested that the grounds be laid so that this change will take place based on thought, principles and problem solving.",23.024437309736
