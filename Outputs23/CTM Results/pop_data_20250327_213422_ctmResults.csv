Despite the significance of this subject, it has still not been fully addressed by the machine intelligence relying on deep learning and computer vision to detect the multi-labels of weather and visual conditions with a unified method that can be easily used in practice. What has been achieved to-date are rather sectorial models that address a limited number of labels that do not cover the wide spectrum of weather and visual conditions. Nonetheless, weather and visual conditions are often addressed individually. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework to automatically extract this information from street-level images relying on deep learning and computer vision using a unified method without any pre-defined constraints in the processed images. A pipeline of four deep convolutional neural network (CNN) models, so-called WeatherNet, is trained, relying on residual learning using ResNet50 architecture, to extract various weather and visual conditions such as dawn/dusk, day and night for time detection, glare for lighting conditions, and clear, rainy, snowy, and foggy for weather conditions. WeatherNet shows strong performance in extracting this information from user-defined images or video streams that can be used but are not limited to autonomous vehicles and drive-assistance systems, tracking behaviours, safety-related research, or even for better understanding cities through images for policy-makers.","Public datasets are valuable for the development of the learning-based algorithms. In the field of autonomous driving, almost all the existing public datasets are collected by manually driving cars, and most of them are contributed by American and European researchers and represent the traffic scenarios typical for these countries. To diversify the public driving datasets and to provide data support for researches on the self-driving vehicles moving on bike lanes, such as wheelchairs, bikes, and some robots, we present the Chinese Driving from a Bike View (CDBV), which is a driving dataset collected by a bike in Beijing, China. The CDBV dataset contains annotated images, raw videos, and code tools. The annotations are for the object detection tasks and especially focus on the categories with Chinese characteristics, including the express tricycles, the motorbikes specializing in takeouts, the bicycle landmarks, the zebra crossings, and the traffic lights. We totally annotated 40 064 traffic elements in 13 427 images. The CDBV dataset is publicly available at http://www.sujingwang.name/CDBV.html.","Video visual relation detection, which aims to detect the visual relations between objects in the form of relation triplet (e.g., “person-ride-bike”, “dog-toward-car”, etc.), is a significant and fundamental task in computer vision. However, most of the existing works about visual relation instances are focused on static images. Modeling the non-static relationships in videos has drawn little attention due to lacking large-scale video dataset support. In our work, we propose a video dataset named Video Predicate Detection and Reasoning (VidPDR) for dynamic video visual relation detection, which consists of 1,000 videos with dense manually dynamic labeled annotations on 21 object classes and 37 predicates classes. Moreover, we propose a novel spatio-temporal feature extraction framework with 3D Convolutional Neural Networks (ST3DCNN), which includes three modules 1) object trajectory, 2) short-term relation prediction, and 3) greedy relational association. We conducted appropriate experiments on public datasets and our own dataset (VidPDR). Results demonstrate that our proposed method has a great improvement in comparison to the state-of-the-art baselines.","The advancements in digital video technology have empowered video surveillance to play a vital role in ensuring security and safety. Public and private enterprises use surveillance systems to monitor and analyze daily activities. Consequently, a massive volume of data is generated in videos that require further processing to achieve security protocol. Analyzing video content is tedious and a time-consuming task. Moreover, it also requires high-speed computing hardware. The video summarization concept has emerged to overcome these limitations. This paper presents a customized video summarization framework based on deep learning. The proposed framework enables a user to summarize the videos according to the Object of Interest (OoI), for example, person, airplane, mobile phone, bike, and car. Various experiments are conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed framework on the video summarization (VSUMM) dataset, title-based video summarization (TVSum) dataset, and own dataset. The accuracy of VSUMM, TVSum, and own dataset is 99.6%, 99.9%, and 99.2%, respectively. A desktop application is also developed to help the user summarize the video based on the OoI.","Abstract— The application of in-depth learning methods has been successfully applied in computer vision task with the ability to learn the features of differences in real world images by directly from the original image by passing layer after layer to get the high dimensions image, in this study we applied the YOLO method approach with network adaptation features based on Darknet-53 on a video dataset recorded by the activities of University of Indonesia Prima (UNPRI) students with are conditions of video with different objects as a surveillance system, based on the results of research into object classification produces an overall accuracy of 93%, but for the classification of objects bikes, buses, and cars have the lowest accuracy of 30% for bikes, 54% of cars and buses by 40% so it is necessary to develop methods to improve accuracy.","Objectives: The aim of this study is to develop an efficient and cost-effective solution for predicting vehicle speeds using recorded video data. Methods: The proposed system employs a combination of image processing techniques and computer vision to calibrate cameras for traffic simulation, enabling the extraction of information on average vehicle speeds. It utilizes the Haar Cascade Classifier for object detection, followed by a correlation tracker for vehicle tracking. Speed estimation is achieved through the frame differencing method. The dataset comprises 90 minutes of recorded data from highway cameras, showcasing diverse traffic scenarios with various vehicle types (trucks, trailers, cars, buses, and bikes) at varying speeds. Predicted values are compared with ground truth data obtained from a GPS-equipped car, using Mean Absolute Error (MAE) as the evaluation metric. Findings: The algorithm's performance is evaluated, resulting in an average error rate of 1.72 km/h (2.07%). These findings are compared with state-of-the-art data.

The traffic flow in urban areas is more complicated than the traffic flow in highway, due to the slow movement of vehicles and crowded traffic flows in urban areas. In this paper, a vehicle detection and classification system at intersections is proposed. The system consists of three main phases: vehicle detection, vehicle tracking and vehicle classification. In the vehicle detection, the background subtraction is utilized to detect the moving vehicles by employing mixture of Gaussians (MoGs) algorithm, and then the removal shadow algorithm is developed to improve the detection phase and eliminate the undesired detected region (shadows). After the vehicle detection phase, the vehicles are tracked until they reach the classification line. Then the vehicle dimensions are utilized to classify the vehicles into three classes (cars, bikes, and trucks). In this system, there are three counters; one counter for each class. When the vehicle is classified to a specific class, the class counter is incremented by one. The counting results can be used to estimate the traffic density at intersections, and adjust the timing of traffic light for the next light cycle. The system is applied to videos obtained by stationary cameras. The results obtained demonstrate the robustness and accuracy of the proposed system.","An Anomaly can be defined as an observation that does follow the normal activities with respect to others. Anomaly is polysemy that varies in a different context. For video sequences, an anomaly can be defined in terms of motion or state of motion that obtrude concerning to state and time. This work is based on Pedestrian Video Surveillance, having a normal event as a pedestrian and abnormal event as cars, skaters, bikers, wheelchairs, etc. i.e., non-pedestrian. A comprehensive study has been carried out of many existing systems for the Anomaly detection system. Based on many existing techniques we select a method called optical flow for the feature presentation of the detection of motion and Histogram of optical flow (HOOF) for the action contour of optical flow for every time instant irrespective of scale and direction of motion. As HOOF represents the motion of an object in a region, so there may be cases that the information related to the motion is not well represented. We used these two techniques along with the labelling of the frame inorderto overcome the problem of HOOF for the classifier. And gives the improved results. ","INTRODUCTION: The prevalence of obesity in children has reached epidemic proportions with over 37% of children aged 6-11 years in the U.S. being classified as ""at risk for overweight"" or ""overweight."" Utilization of active video games has been proposed as one possible mechanism to help shift the tide of the obesity epidemic. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to determine if riding a stationary bike that controlled a video game would lead to significantly greater energy expenditure than riding the same bike without the video game connected. METHODS: Twenty children, 7-14 years old, with a BMI classification of ""at risk for overweight"" or ""overweight"" participated in this study. Following familiarization, energy expenditure was evaluated while riding a stationary bike for 20 minutes. One test was performed without the addition of a video game and one test with the bike controlling the speed of a car on the video game. RESULTS: Oxygen consumption and energy expenditure were significantly elevated above baseline in both conditions. Energy expenditure was significantly higher while riding the bike as it controlled the video game (4.4 ± 1.2 Kcal·min(-1)) than when riding the bike by itself (3.7 ± 1.1 Kcal·min(-1)) (p<0.05). Perceived exertion was not significantly different between the two sessions (p>0.05). CONCLUSION: Using a stationary bike to control a video game led to greater energy expenditure than riding a stationary bike without the video game and without a related increase in perceived exertion.",18.0718233618046,2,dataset

A traffic conflict technique is commonly used in traffic safety analysis, and there are many conflict measures designed for cars. However, e-bikes have high flexibility to change speed and trajectories, which is different from cars, so the conflict measures defined for e-bikes need to be independently explored. Based on e-bike driving characteristics, this paper proposes a new measure, the Integrated Conflict Intensity (ICI), for traffic conflicts involving e-bikes at intersections. It measures the degree of dangerousness of a conflict process, with consideration of both conflict risk and conflict severity. Time to collision is used to measure the conflict risk. Relative kinetic energy is used to measure the conflict severity. ICI can be calculated based on video analysis. The method of determining ICI thresholds for three conflict levels (serious, less serious, and slight) and two conflict types (conflicts between two e-bikes, and conflicts between an e-bike and a car) is put forward based on the questionnaires about safety perception of e-bike riders, which is regarded as the criterion of e-bike safety conditions at intersections. The video recording and a questionnaire survey about conflicts involving e-bikes at intersections have been conducted, and the unified thresholds applicable to different intersections have been determined. It is verified that ICI and its thresholds meet the criterion of e-bike safety conditions. This work is expected to be used in the selection of intersections for safety improvement of e-bike traffic.","Video visual relation detection, which aims to detect the visual relations between objects in the form of relation triplet (e.g., “person-ride-bike”, “dog-toward-car”, etc.), is a significant and fundamental task in computer vision.

This study aims to describe this outcome in elderly people living in rural areas. METHODOLOGY A cross-sectional study was carried out with elderly people from the rural area in the city of Rio Grande/RS, in 2017. Data were collected using an electronic questionnaire. Sedentary behavior was evaluated by eight aspects: watching television/videos/DVDs, using computer/internet, reading, socializing with friends and/or family, driving or riding a car/bike/taking public transport, practicing a hobby, working, and other activities. The analysis was composed by the description of aspects and multivariable (linear regression) analysis to test associations between the outcome and socioeconomic, demographic and physical activity characteristics. Association of the excess of sedentary behavior and time watching television within the independent variables was also verified. RESULTS The mean of sedentary behavior was 274.9 minutes/day (n = 1,030), but watching television represented almost half (130.5 minutes/ day). Age was inversely associated with sedentary behavior, while income and schooling presented a direct relation. Income had a positive association with excessive sedentary behavior and time watching television. CONCLUSION The mean sedentary behavior was lower when compared with the literature for the elderly. We suggest that actions to encourage healthy habits aim especially at reducing the time spent watching television.","This paper reports the results of a recently concluded R&D project, SCALS (Smart Cities Adaptive Lighting System), which aimed at the development of all hardware/software components of an adaptive urban smart lighting architecture allowing municipalities to manage and control public street lighting lamps. The system is capable to autonomously adjust street lamps’ brightness on the basis of the presence of vehicles (busses/trucks, cars, motorcycles and bikes) and/or pedestrians in specific areas or segments of the streets/roads of interest to reduce the energy consumption. The main contribution of this work is to design a low cost smart lighting system and, at same time, to define an IoT infrastructure where each lighting pole is an element of a network that can increase their amplitude. More generally, the proposed smart infrastructure can be viewed as the basis of a wider technological architecture aimed at offering value-added services for sustainable cities. The smart architecture combines various sub-systems (local controllers, motion sensors, video-cameras, weather sensors) and electronic devices, each of them in charge of performing specific operations: remote street segments lamp management, single street lamp brightness control, video processing for vehicles motion detection and classification, wireless and wired data exchanges, power consumptions analysis and traffic evaluation. Two pilot sites have been built up in the project where the smart architecture has been tested and validated in real scenarios. Experimental results show that energy savings of up to 80% are possible compared to a traditional street lamp system.",19.327690904927,0,video

It should be useful enabling drivers to anticipate and detect obstacles in time to prevent accidents to other road users, especially those most vulnerable. We created a pioneering Hazard Perception and Prediction test to explore this skill in different road users (pedestrians, cyclists and drivers), with videos recorded in naturalistic scenarios: walking, riding a bicycle and driving a car. There were 79 participants (30 pedestrians, 14 cyclists, 13 novice drivers and 22 experienced drivers). Sixty videos of hazardous traffic situations were presented, divided into 2 blocks of 30 videos each: 10 walking, 10 riding a bicycle, 10 driving a car. In each situation presented, we evaluated the performance of the participants carrying out the task of predicting the hazard and estimating the risk. In the second block, after they had carried out the task, we gave them feedback on their performance and let them see the whole video (i.e., checking what happened next). The results showed that the holistic test had acceptable psychometric properties (Cronbach’s alpha = .846). The test was able to discriminate between the different conditions manipulated: a) between traffic hazards recorded from different perspectives: walking, riding a bicycle and driving a car; b) between participants with different user profiles: pedestrians, cyclists and drivers; c) between the two test blocks: the first evaluation only and the second combining evaluation with this complex intervention. We found modal bias effects in both Hazard Perception and Prediction; and in Risk Estimation.","While developing traffic-based cognitive enhancement technology (CET), such as bike accident prevention systems, it can be challenging to test and evaluate them properly. After all, the real-world scenario could endanger the subjects’ health and safety. Therefore, a simulator is needed, preferably one that is realistic yet low cost. This paper introduces a way to use the video game Grand Theft Auto V (GTA V) and its sophisticated traffic system as a base to create such a simulator, allowing for the safe and realistic testing of dangerous traffic situations involving cyclists, cars, and trucks. The open world of GTA V, which can be explored on foot and via various vehicles, serves as an immersive stand-in for the real world. Custom modification scripts of the game give the researchers control over the experiment scenario and the output data to be evaluated. An off-the-shelf bicycle equipped with three sensors serves as a realistic input device for the subject’s movement direction and speed. The simulator was used to test two early-stage CET concepts enabling cyclists to sense dangerous traffic situations, such as trucks approaching from behind the cyclist. Thus, this paper also presents the user evaluation of the cycling simulator and the CET used by the subjects to sense dangerous traffic situations. With the knowledge of the first iteration of the user-centered design (UCD) process, this paper concludes by naming improvements for the cycling simulator and discussing further research directions for CET that enable users to sense dangerous situations better.","Large cities’ expanding populations are causing traffic congestion. The maintenance of the city’s road network necessitates ongoing monitoring, growth, and modernization. An intelligent vehicle detection solution is necessary to address road traffic concerns with the advancement of automatic cars. The identification and tracking vehicles on roads and highways are part of intelligent traffic monitoring while driving. In this paper, we have presented how You Only Look Once (YOLO)v5 model may be used to identify cars, traffic lights, and pedestrians in various weather situations, allowing for real-time identification in a typical vehicular environment. In an ordinary or autonomous environment, object detection may be affected by bad weather conditions. Bad weather may make driving dangerous in various ways, whether due to freezing roadways or the illusion of low fog. In this study, we used YOLOv5 model to recognize objects from street-level recordings for rainy and regular weather scenarios on 11 distinct classes of vehicles (car, truck, bike), pedestrians, and traffic signals (red, green, yellow). We utilized freely available Roboflow datasets to train the proposed system. Furthermore, we used real video sequences of road traffic to evaluate the proposed system’s performance. The study results revealed that the suggested approach could recognize cars, trucks, and other roadside items in various circumstances with acceptable results.","As electric bicycles (e-bikes) are becoming popular in China, concerns have been raised about their safety conditions.

The purpose of this pilot study was to determine if interactive video/arcade games, requiring physical activity to play, increase the energy expenditure (EE) and heart rate (HR) of young adults enough to elicit a training response. Thirteen male and female participants 26.6 ± 5.7 years of age were in the study. Participants were familiarized with equipment and allowed to practice with three games: (1) moving and striking lighted pads, (2) riding a bike to increase the pace of a race car, and (3) boxing against a video simulated opponent. A portable metabolic cart and HR monitor were attached to participants to measure baseline and exercise values. Participants could play any of the three games for 30 minutes while metabolic and HR data were collected. Exercise data were compared to baseline measures, and the 3 games were compared for EE. Paired sample t-tests showed baseline and exercise values differed for HR (t(12) = -18.91, p < 0.01), and EE (t(12) = -15.62, p < 0.01). The boxing game provided the highest VO2 (17.47 ± 4.79 ml·kg(·-1)min(-1)). Participants achieved 60% or better of their HR reserve (162.82 ± 10.78 beats·min(-1),) well within the ACSM guidelines for a training HR. Caloric expenditure during the 30-minute exercise session (226. 07 ± 48.68) is also within the ACSM recommendations for daily physical activity. Thus, interactive video/arcade games that require physical activity to play can be utilized as part of an overall aerobic exercise program.","An Anomaly can be defined as an observation that does follow the normal activities with respect to others.

In this paper, a vehicle detection and classification system at intersections is proposed. The system consists of three main phases: vehicle detection, vehicle tracking and vehicle classification. In the vehicle detection, the background subtraction is utilized to detect the moving vehicles by employing mixture of Gaussians (MoGs) algorithm, and then the removal shadow algorithm is developed to improve the detection phase and eliminate the undesired detected region (shadows). After the vehicle detection phase, the vehicles are tracked until they reach the classification line. Then the vehicle dimensions are utilized to classify the vehicles into three classes (cars, bikes, and trucks). In this system, there are three counters; one counter for each class. When the vehicle is classified to a specific class, the class counter is incremented by one. The counting results can be used to estimate the traffic density at intersections, and adjust the timing of traffic light for the next light cycle. The system is applied to videos obtained by stationary cameras. The results obtained demonstrate the robustness and accuracy of the proposed system.",22.4688415692191,4,traffic

The Block Walk Method (BWM) is one of the more common approaches for this purpose. Although it utilizes reliable observation techniques and displays criterion validity, it remains relatively unchanged since its introduction in 2006. It is a nontechnical, labor-intensive, first generation method. Advancing the BWM would contribute significantly to our understanding of PA behavior. Objective This study will develop and test a new BWM that utilizes a wearable video device (WVD) and computer video analysis to assess PAs performed on sidewalks and streets. The specific aims are to improve the BWM by incorporating a WVD (eyeglasses with a high-definition video camera in the frame) into the methodology and advance this WVD-enhanced BWM by applying machine learning and recognition software to automatically extract information on PAs occurring on the sidewalks and streets from the videos. Methods Trained observers (1 wearing and 1 not wearing the WVD) will walk together at a set pace along predetermined 1000 ft sidewalk and street observation routes representing low, medium, and high walkable areas. During the walks, the non-WVD observer will use the traditional BWM to record the numbers of individuals standing, sitting, walking, biking, and running in observation fields along the routes. The WVD observer will continuously video the observation fields. Later, 2 investigators will view the videos to determine the number of individuals performing PAs in the observation fields. The video data will then be analyzed automatically using multiple deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to determine the number of humans in the observation fields and the type of PAs performed. Bland Altman methods and intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) will be used to assess agreement. Potential sources of error such as occlusions (eg, trees) will be assessed using moderator analyses. Results Outcomes from this study are pending; however, preliminary studies supporting the research protocol indicate that the BWM is reliable for determining the PA mode (Cramer V=.89; P<.001), the address where the PA occurred (Cohen kappa=.85; P<.001), and the number engaged in an observed PA (ICC=.85; P<.001). The number of individuals seen walking along routes was correlated with several environmental characteristics such as sidewalk quality (r=.39; P=.02) and neighborhood aesthetics (r=.49; P<.001). Furthermore, we have used CNNs to detect cars, bikes, and pedestrians as well as individuals using park facilities. Conclusions We expect the new approach will enhance measurement accuracy while reducing the burden of data collection. In the future, the capabilities of the WVD-CNN system will be expanded to allow for the determination of other characteristics captured in videos such as caloric expenditure and environmental conditions. International Registered Report Identifier (IRRID) PRR1-10.2196/12976","BACKGROUND A considerable proportion of outdoor physical activity is done on sidewalk/streets. For example, we found that ~70% of adults who walked during the previous week used the sidewalks/streets around their homes. Interventions conducted at geographical levels (e.g., community) and studies examining relationships between environmental conditions (e.g., traffic) and walking/biking, necessitate a reliable measure of physical activities performed on sidewalks/streets. The Block Walk Method (BWM) is one of the more common approaches available for this purpose. Although it utilizes reliable observation techniques and displays criterion validity, it remains relatively unchanged since its introduction in 2006. It is a non-technical, labor-intensive, first generation method. Advancing the BWM would contribute significantly to our understanding of physical activity behavior. OBJECTIVE Therefore, the objective of the proposed study is to develop and test a new BWM that utilizes a wearable video device (WVD) and computer video analysis to assess physical activities performed on sidewalks/streets. The following aims will be completed to accomplish this objective. Aim 1: Improve the BWM by incorporating a WVD into the methodology. The WVD is a pair of eyeglasses with a high definition video camera embedded into the frames. We expect the WVD to be a viable option for improving the acquisition and accuracy of data collected using the BWM. Aim 2: Advance the WVD-enhanced BWM by applying machine learning and recognition software to automatically extract information on physical activities occurring on the sidewalks/streets from the videos. METHODS Trained observers (one wearing and one not wearing the WVD) will walk together at a set pace along predetermined, 1000 ft. sidewalk/street observation routes representing low, medium, and high walkable areas. During the walks, the non-WVD observer will use the traditional BWM to record the number of individuals standing/sitting, walking, biking, and running along the routes. The WVD observer will only record a video while walking. Later, two investigators will view the videos to determine the numbers of individuals performing physical activities along the routes. For aim 2, the video data will be analyzed automatically using multiple deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to determine the number of humans along an observation route as well as the type of physical activities being performed. Bland Altman methods and intraclass correlation coefficients will be used to assess agreement. Potential sources of error such as occlusions (e.g., trees) will be assessed using moderator analyses. RESULTS Outcomes from this study are pending; however, preliminary studies supporting the research protocol indicate that the BWM is reliable and the number of individuals were seen walking along routes are correlated with several environmental characteristics (e.g., traffic, sidewalk defects). Further, we have used CNNs to detect cars, bikes, and pedestrians as well as individuals using park facilities.

In the future, the capabilities of the WVD-CNNs system will be expanded to allow for the determination of other characteristics captured by the videos such as caloric expenditure and environmental conditions.","INTRODUCTION: The prevalence of obesity in children has reached epidemic proportions with over 37% of children aged 6-11 years in the U.S. being classified as ""at risk for overweight"" or ""overweight."" Utilization of active video games has been proposed as one possible mechanism to help shift the tide of the obesity epidemic. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to determine if riding a stationary bike that controlled a video game would lead to significantly greater energy expenditure than riding the same bike without the video game connected. METHODS: Twenty children, 7-14 years old, with a BMI classification of ""at risk for overweight"" or ""overweight"" participated in this study. Following familiarization, energy expenditure was evaluated while riding a stationary bike for 20 minutes. One test was performed without the addition of a video game and one test with the bike controlling the speed of a car on the video game. RESULTS: Oxygen consumption and energy expenditure were significantly elevated above baseline in both conditions. Energy expenditure was significantly higher while riding the bike as it controlled the video game (4.4 ± 1.2 Kcal·min(-1)) than when riding the bike by itself (3.7 ± 1.1 Kcal·min(-1)) (p<0.05). Perceived exertion was not significantly different between the two sessions (p>0.05). CONCLUSION: Using a stationary bike to control a video game led to greater energy expenditure than riding a stationary bike without the video game and without a related increase in perceived exertion.","INTRODUCTION Sedentary behavior has been associated with several health indicators. This study aims to describe this outcome in elderly people living in rural areas. METHODOLOGY A cross-sectional study was carried out with elderly people from the rural area in the city of Rio Grande/RS, in 2017. Data were collected using an electronic questionnaire. Sedentary behavior was evaluated by eight aspects: watching television/videos/DVDs, using computer/internet, reading, socializing with friends and/or family, driving or riding a car/bike/taking public transport, practicing a hobby, working, and other activities. The analysis was composed by the description of aspects and multivariable (linear regression) analysis to test associations between the outcome and socioeconomic, demographic and physical activity characteristics. Association of the excess of sedentary behavior and time watching television within the independent variables was also verified. RESULTS The mean of sedentary behavior was 274.9 minutes/day (n = 1,030), but watching television represented almost half (130.5 minutes/ day). Age was inversely associated with sedentary behavior, while income and schooling presented a direct relation. Income had a positive association with excessive sedentary behavior and time watching television. CONCLUSION The mean sedentary behavior was lower when compared with the literature for the elderly. We suggest that actions to encourage healthy habits aim especially at reducing the time spent watching television.","Video games have become increasingly popular among young adults. The purpose of this pilot study was to determine if interactive video/arcade games, requiring physical activity to play, increase the energy expenditure (EE) and heart rate (HR) of young adults enough to elicit a training response. Thirteen male and female participants 26.6 ± 5.7 years of age were in the study. Participants were familiarized with equipment and allowed to practice with three games: (1) moving and striking lighted pads, (2) riding a bike to increase the pace of a race car, and (3) boxing against a video simulated opponent. A portable metabolic cart and HR monitor were attached to participants to measure baseline and exercise values. Participants could play any of the three games for 30 minutes while metabolic and HR data were collected. Exercise data were compared to baseline measures, and the 3 games were compared for EE. Paired sample t-tests showed baseline and exercise values differed for HR (t(12) = -18.91, p < 0.01), and EE (t(12) = -15.62, p < 0.01). The boxing game provided the highest VO2 (17.47 ± 4.79 ml·kg(·-1)min(-1)). Participants achieved 60% or better of their HR reserve (162.82 ± 10.78 beats·min(-1),) well within the ACSM guidelines for a training HR. Caloric expenditure during the 30-minute exercise session (226. 07 ± 48.68) is also within the ACSM recommendations for daily physical activity. Thus, interactive video/arcade games that require physical activity to play can be utilized as part of an overall aerobic exercise program.","An Anomaly can be defined as an observation that does follow the normal activities with respect to others. Anomaly is polysemy that varies in a different context. For video sequences, an anomaly can be defined in terms of motion or state of motion that obtrude concerning to state and time. This work is based on Pedestrian Video Surveillance, having a normal event as a pedestrian and abnormal event as cars, skaters, bikers, wheelchairs, etc. i.e., non-pedestrian. A comprehensive study has been carried out of many existing systems for the Anomaly detection system. Based on many existing techniques we select a method called optical flow for the feature presentation of the detection of motion and Histogram of optical flow (HOOF) for the action contour of optical flow for every time instant irrespective of scale and direction of motion. As HOOF represents the motion of an object in a region, so there may be cases that the information related to the motion is not well represented. We used these two techniques along with the labelling of the frame inorderto overcome the problem of HOOF for the classifier. And gives the improved results. ","As electric bicycles (e-bikes) are becoming popular in China, concerns have been raised about their safety conditions. A traffic conflict technique is commonly used in traffic safety analysis, and there are many conflict measures designed for cars. However, e-bikes have high flexibility to change speed and trajectories, which is different from cars, so the conflict measures defined for e-bikes need to be independently explored. Based on e-bike driving characteristics, this paper proposes a new measure, the Integrated Conflict Intensity (ICI), for traffic conflicts involving e-bikes at intersections. It measures the degree of dangerousness of a conflict process, with consideration of both conflict risk and conflict severity. Time to collision is used to measure the conflict risk. Relative kinetic energy is used to measure the conflict severity. ICI can be calculated based on video analysis. The method of determining ICI thresholds for three conflict levels (serious, less serious, and slight) and two conflict types (conflicts between two e-bikes, and conflicts between an e-bike and a car) is put forward based on the questionnaires about safety perception of e-bike riders, which is regarded as the criterion of e-bike safety conditions at intersections. The video recording and a questionnaire survey about conflicts involving e-bikes at intersections have been conducted, and the unified thresholds applicable to different intersections have been determined. It is verified that ICI and its thresholds meet the criterion of e-bike safety conditions. This work is expected to be used in the selection of intersections for safety improvement of e-bike traffic.","Abstract— The application of in-depth learning methods has been successfully applied in computer vision task with the ability to learn the features of differences in real world images by directly from the original image by passing layer after layer to get the high dimensions image, in this study we applied the YOLO method approach with network adaptation features based on Darknet-53 on a video dataset recorded by the activities of University of Indonesia Prima (UNPRI) students with are conditions of video with different objects as a surveillance system, based on the results of research into object classification produces an overall accuracy of 93%, but for the classification of objects bikes, buses, and cars have the lowest accuracy of 30% for bikes, 54% of cars and buses by 40% so it is necessary to develop methods to improve accuracy.","The advancements in digital video technology have empowered video surveillance to play a vital role in ensuring security and safety. Public and private enterprises use surveillance systems to monitor and analyze daily activities. Consequently, a massive volume of data is generated in videos that require further processing to achieve security protocol. Analyzing video content is tedious and a time-consuming task. Moreover, it also requires high-speed computing hardware. The video summarization concept has emerged to overcome these limitations. This paper presents a customized video summarization framework based on deep learning. The proposed framework enables a user to summarize the videos according to the Object of Interest (OoI), for example, person, airplane, mobile phone, bike, and car. Various experiments are conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed framework on the video summarization (VSUMM) dataset, title-based video summarization (TVSum) dataset, and own dataset. The accuracy of VSUMM, TVSum, and own dataset is 99.6%, 99.9%, and 99.2%, respectively. A desktop application is also developed to help the user summarize the video based on the OoI.","Objectives: The aim of this study is to develop an efficient and cost-effective solution for predicting vehicle speeds using recorded video data.

The system is capable to autonomously adjust street lamps’ brightness on the basis of the presence of vehicles (busses/trucks, cars, motorcycles and bikes) and/or pedestrians in specific areas or segments of the streets/roads of interest to reduce the energy consumption. The main contribution of this work is to design a low cost smart lighting system and, at same time, to define an IoT infrastructure where each lighting pole is an element of a network that can increase their amplitude. More generally, the proposed smart infrastructure can be viewed as the basis of a wider technological architecture aimed at offering value-added services for sustainable cities. The smart architecture combines various sub-systems (local controllers, motion sensors, video-cameras, weather sensors) and electronic devices, each of them in charge of performing specific operations: remote street segments lamp management, single street lamp brightness control, video processing for vehicles motion detection and classification, wireless and wired data exchanges, power consumptions analysis and traffic evaluation. Two pilot sites have been built up in the project where the smart architecture has been tested and validated in real scenarios. Experimental results show that energy savings of up to 80% are possible compared to a traditional street lamp system.","A novel fuzzy rule based classifier to detect and recognize the type of moving vehicle from video frame using iterative morphological image processing operations is presented in this research work.

The maintenance of the city’s road network necessitates ongoing monitoring, growth, and modernization. An intelligent vehicle detection solution is necessary to address road traffic concerns with the advancement of automatic cars. The identification and tracking vehicles on roads and highways are part of intelligent traffic monitoring while driving. In this paper, we have presented how You Only Look Once (YOLO)v5 model may be used to identify cars, traffic lights, and pedestrians in various weather situations, allowing for real-time identification in a typical vehicular environment. In an ordinary or autonomous environment, object detection may be affected by bad weather conditions. Bad weather may make driving dangerous in various ways, whether due to freezing roadways or the illusion of low fog. In this study, we used YOLOv5 model to recognize objects from street-level recordings for rainy and regular weather scenarios on 11 distinct classes of vehicles (car, truck, bike), pedestrians, and traffic signals (red, green, yellow). We utilized freely available Roboflow datasets to train the proposed system. Furthermore, we used real video sequences of road traffic to evaluate the proposed system’s performance. The study results revealed that the suggested approach could recognize cars, trucks, and other roadside items in various circumstances with acceptable results.","Video visual relation detection, which aims to detect the visual relations between objects in the form of relation triplet (e.g., “person-ride-bike”, “dog-toward-car”, etc.), is a significant and fundamental task in computer vision. However, most of the existing works about visual relation instances are focused on static images. Modeling the non-static relationships in videos has drawn little attention due to lacking large-scale video dataset support. In our work, we propose a video dataset named Video Predicate Detection and Reasoning (VidPDR) for dynamic video visual relation detection, which consists of 1,000 videos with dense manually dynamic labeled annotations on 21 object classes and 37 predicates classes. Moreover, we propose a novel spatio-temporal feature extraction framework with 3D Convolutional Neural Networks (ST3DCNN), which includes three modules 1) object trajectory, 2) short-term relation prediction, and 3) greedy relational association. We conducted appropriate experiments on public datasets and our own dataset (VidPDR). Results demonstrate that our proposed method has a great improvement in comparison to the state-of-the-art baselines.","An Anomaly can be defined as an observation that does follow the normal activities with respect to others.

After all, the real-world scenario could endanger the subjects’ health and safety. Therefore, a simulator is needed, preferably one that is realistic yet low cost. This paper introduces a way to use the video game Grand Theft Auto V (GTA V) and its sophisticated traffic system as a base to create such a simulator, allowing for the safe and realistic testing of dangerous traffic situations involving cyclists, cars, and trucks. The open world of GTA V, which can be explored on foot and via various vehicles, serves as an immersive stand-in for the real world. Custom modification scripts of the game give the researchers control over the experiment scenario and the output data to be evaluated. An off-the-shelf bicycle equipped with three sensors serves as a realistic input device for the subject’s movement direction and speed. The simulator was used to test two early-stage CET concepts enabling cyclists to sense dangerous traffic situations, such as trucks approaching from behind the cyclist. Thus, this paper also presents the user evaluation of the cycling simulator and the CET used by the subjects to sense dangerous traffic situations. With the knowledge of the first iteration of the user-centered design (UCD) process, this paper concludes by naming improvements for the cycling simulator and discussing further research directions for CET that enable users to sense dangerous situations better.","Abstract— The application of in-depth learning methods has been successfully applied in computer vision task with the ability to learn the features of differences in real world images by directly from the original image by passing layer after layer to get the high dimensions image, in this study we applied the YOLO method approach with network adaptation features based on Darknet-53 on a video dataset recorded by the activities of University of Indonesia Prima (UNPRI) students with are conditions of video with different objects as a surveillance system, based on the results of research into object classification produces an overall accuracy of 93%, but for the classification of objects bikes, buses, and cars have the lowest accuracy of 30% for bikes, 54% of cars and buses by 40% so it is necessary to develop methods to improve accuracy.","As electric bicycles (e-bikes) are becoming popular in China, concerns have been raised about their safety conditions.
