Rationale Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) accredited residency programs report the United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE) Step 1 and Comprehensive Osteopathic Licensing Examination-USA (COMLEX-USA) Level 1 scores as the most important criteria in selecting candidates to interview. Hypotheses (1) Certain resources are superior for exam preparation. (2) Certain practice tests better assess exam preparedness. (3) USMLE performance will correlate with the COMLEX-USA. Methods One-hundred and two (102) medical students were surveyed regarding preparation for and performance on COMLEX-USA Level 1 and USMLE Step 1. Results USMLE-specific question banks were positively correlated with performance on COMLEX-USA Level 1 and USMLE Step 1 while COMLEX-specific question banks showed no correlation. National Board of Medical Examiners (NBME) Comprehensive Basic Science Self Assessment (CBSSA) and National Board of Osteopathic Medical Examiners (NBOME) Comprehensive Osteopathic Medical Self-Assessment Examination (COMSAE) practice examinations were positively correlated with performance on the USMLE Step 1 and the COMLEX-USA Level 1. Scores on USMLE Step 1 and COMLEX-USA Level 1 were highly correlated. Students who took USMLE Step 1 performed better on COMLEX-USA Level 1 than those who did not. Conclusion COMLEX-specific resources may not adequately prepare students for COMLEX-USA Level 1. Students studying for COMLEX-USA Level 1 may benefit by preparing for USMLE Step 1.,"BACKGROUND The Objective Structured Clinical Evaluation (OSCE) has been considered a reliable method for the evaluation of students' clinical skills in health sciences, but it has been rarely applied in the teaching of physical therapy. OBJECTIVE To assess the use of the OSCE as a tool to evaluate the abilities of undergraduate chest physical therapy students and to verify the internal consistency of the OSCE exam. METHODS Forty-seven students were evaluated using two types of exams: the traditional exam and the OSCE. Independent educators elaborated the exams. Each question (traditional) or station (OSCE) was given a score ranging from 0.0 to 2.0; being 10.0 the highest possible score of both exams. The relationship between the total score that were obtained from both exams was analyzed using Bland-Altman analysis and Pearson's correlation coefficient. The internal consistency of the OSCE stations was evaluated by four experienced chest physical therapists and it was tested using Cronbach's alpha. RESULTS The students' average score on the OSCE ranged from 4.4 to 9.6. The internal consistency of the OSCE stations was considered good (0.7). The agreement between exams was analyzed, and it was determined that the exams are not comparable. Examiners also observed a low agreement between the two exams (r=-0.1; p=0.9). CONCLUSION Our results showed that OSCE and traditional exams are not interchangeable. The OSCE exam had good internal consistency and is able to evaluate aspects that the traditional exam fails to evaluate.","Sir, Assessment of learning has always been a difficult, yet an essential component of an educational program. In the undergraduate medical education system in India, curricular guidelines of Medical Council of India lay emphasis on methods of assessment of knowledge and skills in pharmacology.[1] Although continuous formative assessment constitutes an integral part in the curriculum, the ‘pass’ and the ‘fail’ certificates are based to a great extent on students’ performance in the final summative examination. The final examination consists of written papers, viva-voce sessions and practical exercises. Written examination consists of two papers. Each paper has the maximum marks of 40 and contains structured essay type questions and short notes. In viva-voce examination, each student is assessed by five examiners; two of them external examiners and the others internal examiners. In order to pass, a candidate must obtain 50% marks in aggregate with a minimum of 50% marks in written and viva together and a minimum of 50% marks in practical examination.[1] The written examination is a useful evaluation format that not only tests students’ ability to recall facts, but also can assess higher-order cognitive functions, such as interpretation of data and problem solving skills. The viva-voce examination on the other hand is a general encounter between a candidate and one or more examiners.[2] Viva-voce examinations are less reliable as they are essentially subjective in nature, afflicted with ‘halo effects’, errors of central tendency, a general tendency toward leniency, and errors of contrast.[2] Examiners mostly indulge in over-marking in viva-voce examinations in order to make an otherwise undeserving candidate ‘pass’. We explored this recently in a small questionnaire-based interview among examiners of pharmacology in one university and the examiners admitted showing such ‘leniency’. Against this backdrop, we planned the present study to compare students’ performance in written and viva-voce components of the final summative pharmacology examination in MBBS curriculum in order to have a critical insight into the two modes of evaluation, the way they are practiced. This was a record-based observational study done in a medical college in India that also served as an examination centre for second professional MBBS examination in pharmacology for four consecutive years, from 2008 to 2011. The performance of students was assessed. Permission for access to the students’ score sheets was obtained from appropriate authority and confidentiality of individual student’s score was maintained. Percentage of marks obtained by four batches of students (n=589), in consecutive years (2008-11), in written and viva-voce components of the final summative examination in pharmacology were reviewed: Batch 1 (Jan 2011 Exam, n=159), Batch 2 (Jan 2010 Exam, n=139), Batch 3 (Jan 2009 Exam, n=148), Batch 4 (Jan 2008 Exam, n=143). Based on their performance in terms of percentage of marks in aggregate, all students in a batch were classified into four categories viz., ‘failed’(F) – <50%, ‘borderline passed’ (BP) – 50-57%, ‘passed’ (P) – >57% to <75% and ‘passed with distinction’ (PD) – ≥75%. Correlation was assessed between the percentage of marks obtained by students in these categories in written vis-a-vis viva-voce examination. Highly significant association was observed in marks obtained by students in P and PD categories in all four batches in viva-voce and written examination (P<0.001). However, no significant association was observed in marks obtained by students in F and BP categories in all four batches in viva-voce and written examination (P>0.05). The results are shown in Table 1. Interestingly, no student in F category got 50% marks in written examination, but most of them scored satisfactorily in the viva-voce. Among all the students in F category, three students in 2008, five in 2009, four in 2010 and none in 2011 failed in practical examination. The number of students in each category (e.g., F, BP, P and PD) when compared among the 4 years (2008-11) did not show any significant difference [Figure 1]. Our study showed that there was highly significant association between written and viva-voce marks of students in the PD and P categories (P<0.001). We interpret this as the ‘true’ reflection of knowledge and competence of the students in this category. Our study also revealed that there was a lack of significant association in performance in written and viva-voce examination among students in F and BP categories (P>0.05). Marks obtained by students in viva-voce were higher with respect to those in written examination in these two categories. Rather, the poorer the performance in written examination, the higher the marks obtained in the viva-voce. Such trend is most prominent in the F category of students Access this article online","Introduction The curriculum in most emergency medicine (EM) clerkships includes very little formalized training in point-of-care ultrasound. Medical schools have begun to implement ultrasound training in the pre-clinical curriculum, and the EM clerkship is an appropriate place to build upon this training. The objectives are (1) to evaluate the effectiveness of implementing a focused ultrasound curriculum within an established EM clerkship and (2) to obtain feedback from medical students regarding the program. Methods We conducted a prospective cohort study of medical students during an EM clerkship year from July 1, 2011, to June 30, 2012. Participants included fourth-year medical students (n=45) enrolled in the EM clerkship at our institution. The students underwent a structured program focused on the focused assessment with sonography for trauma exam and ultrasound-guided vascular access. At the conclusion of the rotation, they took a 10-item multiple choice test assessing knowledge and image interpretation skills. A cohort of EM residents (n=20) also took the multiple choice test but did not participate in the training with the students. We used an independent samples t-test to examine differences in test scores between the groups. Results The medical students in the ultrasound training program scored significantly higher on the multiple-choice test than the EM residents, t(63)=2.3, p<0.05. The feedback from the students indicated that 82.8% were using ultrasound on their current rotations and the majority (55.2%) felt that the one-on-one scanning shift was the most valuable aspect of the curriculum. Discussion Our study demonstrates support for an ultrasound training program for medical students in the EM clerkship. After completing the training, students were able to perform similarly to EM residents on a knowledge-based exam.","Introduction The purpose of this study was to determine the associations and predictive values of Medical College Admission Test (MCAT) component and composite scores prior to 2015 with U.S. Medical Licensure Exam (USMLE) Step 1 and Step 2 Clinical Knowledge (CK) scores, with a focus on whether students scoring low on the MCAT were particularly likely to continue to score low on the USMLE exams. Method Multiple linear regression, correlation, and chi-square analyses were performed to determine the relationship between MCAT component and composite scores and USMLE Step 1 and Step 2 CK scores from five graduating classes (2011–2015) at the University of Minnesota Medical School (N=1,065). Results The multiple linear regression analyses were both significant (p<0.001). The three MCAT component scores together explained 17.7% of the variance in Step 1 scores (p<0.001) and 12.0% of the variance in Step 2 CK scores (p<0.001). In the chi-square analyses, significant, albeit weak associations were observed between almost all MCAT component scores and USMLE scores (Cramer's V ranged from 0.05 to 0.24). Discussion Each of the MCAT component scores was significantly associated with USMLE Step 1 and Step 2 CK scores, although the effect size was small. Being in the top or bottom scoring range of the MCAT exam was predictive of being in the top or bottom scoring range of the USMLE exams, although the strengths of the associations were weak to moderate. These results indicate that MCAT scores are predictive of student performance on the USMLE exams, but, given the small effect sizes, should be considered as part of the holistic view of the student.","Background: Undergraduate medical examination is undergoing extensive re evaluation with new core educational objectives being defined. Consequently, new exam systems have also been designed to test the objectives. Objective structured practical examination (OSPE) is one of them. Objectives: To introduce OSPE as a method of assessment of practical skills and learning and to determine student satisfaction regarding the OSPE. Furthermore, to explore the faculty perception of OSPE as a learning and assessment tool. Materials and Methods: The first M.B.B.S students of 2011 12 batch of Medical College, Kolkata, were the subjects for the study. OSPE was organized and conducted on “Identification of Unknown Abnormal Constituents in Urine.” Coefficient of reliability of questions administered was done by calculating Cronbach's alpha. A questionnaire on various components of the OSPE was administered to get the feedback. Results: 16 students failed to achieve an average of 50% or above in the assessment. However, 49 students on an average achieved >75%, 52 students achieved between 65% and 75%, and 29 students scored between 50% and 65%. Cronbach's alpha of the questions administered showed to be having high internal consistency with a score of 0.80. Ninety nine percent of students believed that OSPE helps them to improve and 81% felt that this type of assessment fits in as both learning and evaluation tools. Faculty feedback reflected that such assessment tested objectivity, measured practical skills better, and eliminated examiner bias to a greater extent. Conclusion: OSPE tests different desired components of competence better and eliminated examiner bias. Student feedback reflects that such assessment helps them to improve as it is effective both as teaching and evaluation tools.","Background Musculoskeletal (MSK) complaints comprise a large proportion of outpatient visits. However, multiple studies show that medical school curriculum often fails to adequately prepare graduates to diagnose and manage common MSK problems. Current standardised exams inadequately assess trainees’ MSK knowledge and other MSK-specific exams such as Freedman and Bernstein’s (1998) exam have limitations in implementation. We propose a new 30-question multiple choice exam for graduating medical students and primary care residents. Results highlight individual deficiencies and identify areas for curriculum improvement. Methods/Results We developed a bank of multiple choice questions based on 10 critical topics in MSK medicine. The questions were validated with subject-matter experts (SMEs) using a modified Delphi method to obtain consensus on the importance of each question. Based on the SME input, we compiled 30 questions in the assessment. Results of the large-scale pilot test (167 post-clerkship medical students) were an average score of 74 % (range 53% – 90 %, SD 7.8%). In addition, the tool contains detailed explanations and references were created for each question to allow an individual or group to review and enhance learning. Summary The proposed MSK30 exam evaluates clinically important topics and offers an assessment tool for clinical MSK knowledge of medical students and residents. It fills a gap in current curriculum and improves on previous MSK-specific assessments through better clinical relevance and consistent grading. Educators can use the results of the exam to guide curriculum development and individual education.","Introduction: Nowadays according to competency based curriculum, selecting an appropriate assessment method is inevitable. This study aimed to investigate application of Direct Observation of Procedural Skills (DOPS) in undergraduate medical students. Methods: This is a cross sectional study conducted during emergency ward rotation in last year medical students using consensus sampling method. Each student performed 2 procedures at least twice under the observation of 2 assessors using modified DOPS rating scales designed for each procedure simultaneously. Correlation between DOPS score and final routine exam was measured. Face and content validity was determined by the panel of experts. Moreover, through the test-retest and inter-rater reliability, the correlation of each score and total score was investigated. The spent time was calculated too. The statistical analysis was carried out using SPSS version 18. Results: Totally 60 students did 240 procedures under DOPS. The face and content validity confirmed by an expert panel. The findings showed that there was a significant correlation between the scores of each test and the total DOPS score (r1=0.736**, r2=0.793**, r3=0.564**, r4=0.685**; p<0.001). There was a significant correlation between the first and second scores of doing the same procedure (Pearson Cor.=0.74, p<0.001) and also between the scores of the two individual examiners when observing the same procedure (Pearson Cor.=0.84-0.94 p<0.001). The results showed that there was no correlation (Pearson Correlation =0.018, p<0.89) between the scores of this test and the final routine ward exam scores. The average time for doing DOPS test and the average time for providing feedback were 11.17 Max and 9.2 4.5 Min, respectively. Conclusion: The use of novel performance assessment methods such as DOPS is highly beneficial in order to ensure the adequacy of learning in medical students and assess their readiness for accepting professional responsibilities. DOPS as a practical and reliable test with acceptable validation can be used to assess clinical skills of undergraduate medical students.","Medical programs are under pressure to maintain currency with scientific and technical advances, as well as prepare graduates for clinical work and a wide range of postgraduate careers. The value of the basic sciences in primary medical education was assessed by exploring the perceived clinical relevance and test performance trends among medical students, interns, residents, and experienced clinicians. A pilot study conducted in 2014 involved administration of a voluntary 60-item multiple-choice question test to 225 medical students and 4 interns. These participants and 26 teaching clinicians rated the items for clinical relevance. In 2016, a similarly constructed test (main study) was made a mandatory formative assessment, attempted by 563 students in years 2, 4, and 6 and by 120 commencing general practice residents. Test scores, performance trends, clinical relevance ratings, and correlations were assessed using relevant parametric and nonparametric tests. Rank order and pass-fail decisions were also reviewed. The mean test scores were 57% (SD 7.1) and 52% (SD 6.1) for the pilot and main studies, respectively. Highest scores were observed in pathology and social sciences. Overall performance increased with increasing year of study. Test scores were positively correlated with perceived relevance. There were moderate correlations (r = 0.50-0.63; P < 0.001) between participants' scores in the basic science and summative exams. Assessments may be key to fostering relevance and integration of the basic sciences. Benchmarking knowledge retention and result comparisons across topics are useful in program evaluation.","Background Objective Structured Clinical Examinations (OSCEs) have been used to assess the clinical competence of medical students for decades. Limited data are available on the factors that predict students’ performance on the OSCEs. The aim of our study was to evaluate the factors predicting performance on the pediatrics final OSCE, including the timing of students’ clerkship and their performance on the in-training OSCE and written examinations. Methods Grades in pediatrics for 3 consecutive academic years (2013–2016) were included. The average scores of the in-training OSCEs, written and final OSCEs and written exams were compared among the three years using the analysis of variance (ANOVA) test. The correlations between performance on the final OSCEs and the in-training OSCEs, in-training written exams and final written exams were studied using Spearman’s Rho correlation test. The effect of the timing of the clerkship on the final OSCE performance was evaluated. Results A total of 286 students’ records were included. There were 115 male students and 171 female students (M:F 1:1.5). There were strong positive correlations between students’ performance on the in-training examinations (OSCE and written) and the final OSCE (correlation coefficients of 0.508 and 0.473, respectively). The final written exam scores were positively correlated with the final OSCEs (r = 0.448). There was no significant effect of the timing of the clerkship. Conclusions Students’ performance on in-training examinations might predict their final OSCE scores. Thus, it is important to provide students with the necessary intervention at an early stage to reduce failure rates. The final OSCE performance does not seem to be affected by the timing of the clerkship.",16.9811653001258,2,"examin, medic, clinic"

The research method used in this study is quantitative research with a correlational approach. The population in this study consists of all eighth-grade students at SMP Negeri 1 Toma, totaling 65 students. The sampling technique used is total sampling, meaning the entire population is used as the sample. The instruments in this study include closed-ended questionnaires and students' mathematics learning outcomes in the form of even semester final exam scores (UKK). Data analysis techniques involve describing the data, correlational analysis, coefficient of determination, and hypothesis testing. The results of this study show that there is a positive and significant relationship between students' interest in learning and their mathematics learning outcomes, and there is also an influence of students' interest in learning on their mathematics learning outcomes. It can be concluded that 1) because students have a sense of enjoyment, interest, and a high desire to learn that they perceive as beneficial and satisfying, and 2) students feel comfortable, are aware of the benefits of learning, and understand the learning objectives, which makes them interested and leads to an improvement in learning outcomes.","This study aims to determine whether there is a positive and significant relationship and there is an influence between learning interest on Integrated Science learning outcomes. The type of research used in this research is quantitative research with correlational methods. The population in this study were all 65 students of class VII at SMP Negeri 4 Maniamolo. The sampling technique uses a total sampling technique, meaning that the entire population is used as a sample. The instrument in this study used a closed questionnaire and students' science learning outcomes were in the form of odd semester final exam scores.

The test results in this study indicate that there is a positive and significant relationship between learning interest on science learning outcomes, and there is also an influence between learning interest on Integrated Science learning outcomes. So it was concluded that 1) because students have a sense of pleasure, interest, and a high desire for learning which is seen as giving them benefits and satisfaction, 2) students have a sense of comfort, are aware of the benefits of learning, and know the learning goals that make them interested so that learning occurs. improvement in learning outcomes.","Teacher education programs are often accused of lacking intellectual rigor and failing to cultivate the competencies their graduates will need. Using data from the National Survey of Student Engagement, Mr. Carini and Mr. Kuh find that the educational experiences of future teachers compare favorably with those of other students in college. However, these positive experiences do not necessarily stem from teacher education programs. SOONER OR LATER, discussions of schooling turn to teacher quality. Both educational leaders and the general public agree that high-quality teachers are a key to boosting student achievement.1 Why might we not have the high-quality teachers we need? Two reasons dominate the debate. The first is self-selection -- the academic ability of those who choose to teach is thought to be a cut (or more) below that of peers headed to other vocations. Second, teacher preparation programs supposedly lack intellectual rigor and don't cultivate certain critical skills and competencies in their students. Though the evidence supporting these claims is far from conclusive,2 universities and policy makers seem determined to upgrade teacher quality. One popular approach is to raise the bar for entry into teacher preparation programs by requiring higher minimum college grades or higher scores on entrance exams. This strategy recalls the specious criteria used in many annual rankings of colleges and universities in which higher scores on such input measures as entrance tests and more resources for faculty salaries or in an endowment yield higher ""quality"" rankings for the university. The public remains mesmerized by such ranking schemes, despite decades of research on college-level learning that point to a very different conclusion. Indeed, studies show that what matters far more to learning and a host of other desired outcomes during college is what students do with their time and how they use the institution's educational resources, not the test scores they bring to college or the resources a school has. Equally important, scores on college entrance tests and even such outcome measures as the Praxis I and II exams don't tell us what we should focus on to enhance teacher preparation, because it isn't clear which institutional policies or practices affect the outcomes of interest. Looking Behind Test Scores and Outcomes The best predictor of learning and personal development for college students is the amount of time and energy they expend on educationally fruitful activities.3 For example, the more students study or practice, the more they learn or the better they become at something. How can we find out whether students are doing these and other productive activities during college? Process indicators are one potentially instructive source of information. These are measures that represent effective educational practices -- student and institutional behaviors that theory and research show are empirically linked to desired outcomes.4 The argument goes like this: future teachers who are challenged more academically during college or who have considerable firsthand experience in educationally meaningful pursuits, such as active and collaborative learning or classes that demand the use of higher-order thinking skills, will tend to be more effective teachers after college because they will learn more during college and will be well positioned to use similar strategies in their own teaching.5 Consider service learning, which is linked to a host of desirable outcomes.6 If we think of service learning as ""a teaching strategy that connects community service with the curriculum,""7 it stands to reason that teachers who've had this experience during college will be better prepared to use this and allied instructional strategies in their own classrooms when they begin teaching. If teacher education programs had valid, reliable process indicators, then faculty members and others could diagnose in which areas prospective teachers were underperforming relative to established standards or compared with their peers in other fields. …","This study aims to provide the right solution in overcoming the problem of selection for prominent class students senior high school at SMAN 2 Pematangsiantar. The solution is to make a decision support system for the selection of prominent class XI IPA students in determining rankings. The method used is the TOPSIS (Technique for Order Performance by Similarity to Ideal Solution) algorithm by using several criteria, namely: Mid Test Score, Final Exam Score, Extracurricular, Personality, and Attitude. The results of student data processing using the decision support system obtained weights of 1, 0.57188272655161, and 0.56259472567445 for rank 1 to rank 3. The implementation of this Decision Support System is beneficial and makes it easier for the school and the homeroom teacher to determine ranking for the selection of prominent class students.","Abstract This paper presents the findings of a descriptive survey research that investigated what makes students dislike Mathematics and seeks potentially effective Mathematics teaching practices, to boost their interest. The study involved 94 participants, including 60 lower-level secondary school students and 34 Mathematics teachers from 5 schools in Karongi District, Western Province, Rwanda. Both students’ and teachers’ questionnaire responses were analyzed using descriptive statistics. We found that what makes students dislike Mathematics is related to how Mathematics is taught. Low scores in tests or exams, teachers’ harshness, and carelessness were reported among the factors demotivating students to like Mathematics. Being able to show the relevance of Mathematics in an everyday situation, teaching students to remember mathematical facts, and showing them lots of worked examples were mentioned by most of the teachers as indicators of effective Mathematics teaching practices. Together with these indicators, preparing the lesson before teaching, providing exercises and homework to students, and making research to update teachers’ teaching skills have been drawn and recommended for teachers as potentially effective teaching practices.","In this paper, we investigate the correspondence between student affect and behavioural engagement in a web-based tutoring platform throughout the school year and learning outcomes at the end of the year on a high-stakes mathematics exam in a manner that is both longitudinal and fine-grained. Affect and behaviour detectors are used to estimate student affective states and behaviour based on post-hoc analysis of tutor log-data. For every student action in the tutor, the detectors give us an estimated probability that the student is in a state of boredom, engaged concentration, confusion, or frustration, and estimates of the probability that the student is exhibiting off-task or gaming behaviours. We used data from the ASSISTments math tutoring system and found that boredom during problem solving is negatively correlated with performance, as expected; however, boredom is positively correlated with performance when exhibited during scaffolded tutoring. A similar pattern is unexpectedly seen for confusion. Engaged concentration and, surprisingly, frustration are both associated with positive learning outcomes. In a second analysis, we build a unified model that predicts student standardized examination scores from a combination of student affect, disengaged behaviour, and performance within the learning system. This model achieves high overall correlation to standardized exam score, showing that these types of features can effectively infer longer-term learning outcomes.","Using data from Indonesia, Newhouse and Beegle to evaluate the impact of school type on academic achievement of junior secondary school students (grades 7-9). Students that graduate from public junior secondary schools, controlling for a variety of other characteristics, score 0.15 to 0.3 standard deviations higher on the national exit exam than comparable privately schooled peers. This finding is robust to OLS, fixed-effects, and instrumental variable estimation strategies. Students attending Muslim private schools, including Madrassahs, fare no worse on average than students attending secular private schools. The results provide indirect evidence that higher quality inputs at public junior secondary schools promote higher test scores.","This study aims to determine the achievement level in each competency given to students and to know the average percentage of post-e-learning student scores. The research method used is quantitative with descriptive statistical techniques. This research population is sports education students 2017, 2018, and 2019 active students, with a sample of 10% of the population. The determination of this sample is based on purposive sampling. Data collection techniques using test instruments, in the form of questions and semester exam results. The research data analysis technique uses descriptive statistical methods obtained during the 2019-2020 semester, namely the Final Semester Examination value. After feeling that it is sufficient to obtain data and process, it will get the research results after feeling that it is enough to get the data and processed to get the research results. The results of the study found that effective learning was seen from 83% of students getting course scores with an average of above 75 at the time of the final even semester examinations in 2019-2020, and it can be concluded that the effectiveness of e-learning in Sports Education students at the Indonesian Technocrat University was successful. With a student passing rate above 80%. It is hoped that this e-learning process will be further developed with a better platform for facing future generations where the role of technology is a significant thing in meeting the changing times.","Basically grades that do not meet graduation criteria  are phenomenon for schools.

Three data sources were used: One source identified states requiring a standardized test for graduation; the NCES provided state aggregated data on graduation rates for the class of 2002; and the College Board provided its 2001 SAT database for all test-takers. After controlling for students' demographic characteristics (e.g., race, family education and income, GPA and class rank), regression analyses revealed that states requiring graduation exams had lower graduation rates and lower SAT scores. Individually, students from states requiring a graduation exam performed more poorly on the SAT than did students from states not requiring an exam.

Materials and Methods: A questionnaire based cross-sectional study was conducted among 3 rd and 4 th year students of a dental school. Questionnaire used in the study comprised the modified version of the questionnaire used in Dental Environmental Stress. A four-point Likert scale was used to record the responses from the subjects. A total of 174 subjects participated in the study. Statistical analysis was done using SPSS package version 16. Results: Of the participants, 39% (68) were males and 61% (106) were females. Majority of students felt stressed about academic performance, clinic/patient related stress, and career related stress. Top stressors in academic performance related stress were exam and grade stress (95%), followed by fear of failing (90.5%), lack of time between tests/clinics, and criticism at work (94%). Mean stress scores were significantly related to year and gender of students. Conclusion: Worries about fulfilling clinical requirements, academics, exam stress, and insecurity regarding career were the major sources of stress reported by the clinical year dental students in the present study.","As adolescents spend the majority of their time focused on exams and assignments, they do not have sufficient time to engage in physical activity; this lack of physical activity is an important public health concern. This study aimed to investigate how school-based physical activity programs affect the health-related physical fitness of adolescents in the Republic of Korea. For this study, a total of 120 high school students participated in a school-based physical activity program that included badminton and table tennis for 15 weeks each (35 min/day, three times a week), with a total of 30 weeks for one academic year. The parameters for health-related physical fitness measured muscle strength (handgrip strength), power (standing long jump), cardiorespiratory fitness (shuttle run test), flexibility (sit and reach), body mass index (BMI), and the total score. The results revealed a statistically significant improvement in muscle strength (p < 0.001), power (p < 0.001), cardiorespiratory fitness (p < 0.001), flexibility (p = 0.005), and the overall health-related physical fitness score (p = 0.001). However, students’ BMI showed no significant difference before and after participation (p = 0.825). The results of this study indicated that school-based physical activity programs can have a positive effect on the health-related physical fitness of adolescents.","OBJECTIVES The aim of this study was to assess the psychological health of first-year health professional students and to study sources of student stress. METHODS All first-year students (N = 125) of the Gulf Medical University (GMU) in Ajman, United Arab Emirates (UAE), were invited to participate in a voluntary, anonymous, self-administered, questionnaire-based survey in January 2011. Psychological health was assessed using the 12-item General Health Questionnaire. A 24-item questionnaire, with items related to academic, psychosocial and health domains was used to identify sources of stress. Pearson's chi-squared test and the Mann-Whitney U-test were used for testing the association between psychological morbidity and sources of stress. RESULTS A total of 112 students (89.6%) completed the survey and the overall prevalence of psychological morbidity was found to be 33.6%. The main academic-related sources of stress were 'frequency of exams', 'academic workload', and 'time management'. Major psychosocial stressors were 'worries regarding future', 'high parental expectations', 'anxiety', and 'dealing with members of the opposite sex'. Health-related issues were 'irregular eating habits', 'lack of exercise', and 'sleep-related problems'. Psychological morbidity was not significantly associated with any of the demographic factors studied. However, total stress scores and academics-related domain scores were significantly associated with psychological morbidity. CONCLUSION Psychological morbidity was seen in one in three first-year students attending GMU. While worries regarding the future and parental expectations were sources of stress for many students, psychological morbidity was found to be significantly associated with only the total stress and the academic-related domain scores.","OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to assess the relationship between the use of neuroenhancing substances, exam anxiety and academic performance among first-year Bosnian-Herzegovinian (BH) university students. METHODS In a cross-sectional study, an ad hoc questionnaire was delivered to a sample of BH first-year university students. The following data were collected: socio-demographic features, consumption of neuroenchancing substances, the Westside Test Anxiety Scale (WTAS) and academic performance. RESULTS A total of 214 students were included. Consumption of lifestyle substances, coffee, energy drinks, nicotine, alcohol, and marijuana, for the purpose of neuroenhancement increased during the week before the exams. OTC cognitive enhancer use was reported by 31.0%, and of benzodiazepines by 1.5% of students. No psycostimulants were used. A high to extremely high exam WTAS score was reported in 38.3% students. The exam WTAS score was positively correlated with consumption of coffee (rho=0.31; P<0.001), energy drinks (rho=0.18; P=0.009), and nicotine (rho=0.22; P=0.001), and negatively correlated with last exam grade (rho=-0.33; P<0.001). The exam WTAS score was a significant independent predictor (OR=0.55; 95% CI 0.31 to 0.97, P=0.039) for self-assessed academic performance. Self-assessed academic performance was positively correlated with last exam grade (rho=0.15; P=0.043). CONCLUSIONS Although first-year BH university students do not seem to use either prescription or illicit psycostimulants, the consumption of nicotine, alcohol, and marijuana is worrying. However, the consumption of these neuroenhancing substances seems not to be related to better self-assessed academic performance. Finally, exam anxiety seems to be a significant problem among BH first-year university students.","Objectives The study objectives were to identify the stress levels and to explore the impact of students' year of study and gender on the perceived sources of stress among Malaysian dental students. Methods This was a cross-sectional study involving dental students from year one to year five from private and public universities in Malaysia. The study was formally approved by the Research and Ethics Committee, International Medical University Malaysia. Dental Environment Stress (DES) questionnaire was used for data collection and the gathered data were analyzed using SPSS® version 18. The Kruskal-Wallis and the Mann-Whitney U tests were used to compare stress items across various academic years and universities. Results A total of five hundred and twenty nine (529) students participated in this study. Fear of failing the course at the end of year exams (mean stress level=5.57); concerns regarding completion of clinical work (mean=5.30); and examination results and grades (mean=5.27) were found as top stressors among dental students. Female students had higher stress scores than males with respect to personal issues, academic performance, educational environment and learning of clinical skills. Students from public universities had higher stress scores than their counterparts from private universities. Conclusion The Malaysian dental students reported higher levels of stress. Present study identified stressors affecting dental students' academic life, and highlights the importance of stress management programs and other measures to minimize the impact of stress on both academic and personal lives of the students.","Our previous research Kost et al., Phys. Rev. ST Phys. Educ. Res. 5, 010101 2009 examined gender differences in the first-semester, introductory physics class at the University of Colorado at Boulder. We found that: 1 there were gender differences in several aspects of the course, including conceptual survey performance, 2 these differences persisted despite the use of interactive engagement techniques, and 3 the post-test gender differences could largely be attributed to differences in males’ and females’ prior physics and math performance and their incoming attitudes and beliefs. In the current study, we continue to characterize gender differences in our physics courses by examining the second-semester, electricity and magnetism course. We analyze three factors: student retention from Physics 1 to Physics 2, student performance, and students’ attitudes and beliefs about physics, and find gender differences in all three of these areas. Specifically, females are less likely to stay in the physics major than males. Despite males and females performing about equally on the conceptual pretest, we find that females score about 6 percentage points lower than males on the conceptual post-test. In most semesters, females outperform males on homework and participation, and males outperform females on exams, resulting in course grades of males and females that are not significantly different. In terms of students’ attitudes and beliefs, we find that both males and females shift toward less expertlike beliefs over the course of Physics 2. Shifts are statistically equal for all categories except for the Personal Interest category, where females have more negative shifts than males. A large fraction of the conceptual post-test gender gap up to 60% can be accounted for by differences in males’ and females’ prior physics and math performance and their pre-Physics 2 attitudes and beliefs. Taken together, the results of this study suggest that it is an accumulation of small gender differences over time that may be responsible for the large differences that we observe in physics participation of males and females.","Objective Test anxiety (TA) is a construct that has scarcely been studied based on Lang’s three-dimensional model of anxiety. The objective of this article is to investigate the repercussion of sociodemographic and academic variables on different responses for each component of anxiety and for the type of test in adolescent students. Method A total of 1181 students from 12 to 18 years old (M = 14.7 and SD = 1.8) participated, of whom 569 were boys (48.2%) and 612 girls (51.8%). A sociodemographic questionnaire and the Cuestionario de Ansiedad ante los examenes-Adaptado (CAEX-A) [Test Anxiety Questionnaire-Adapted] an adaptation for Spanish secondary school levels (ESO) and Bachillerato were administered. Results Girls scored higher on the cognitive and physiological components of TA than boys, the intensity of the physiological response increasing with age. Bachillerato level students reported more physiological anxiety than those of ESO level. Students with better marks in the previous year presented more anxiety in the cognitive component, while those who obtained the lower mark presented higher anxiety values in the behavioral component. Participants reported that the types of tests that cause them more anxiety were oral tests in front of the class, oral presentation in front of a panel, and mathematics tests. Conclusion Adolescents show a differential response of TA based on the physiological, cognitive and motor components, mediated by the variables of gender, age, grade, academic performance and type of exam. These results serve to design specific intervention programs to manage anxiety in situations of academic assessment.","Rotator cuff tears have been reported to be uncommon following total shoulder arthroplasty (TSA). Postoperative rotator cuff tears can lead to pain, proximal humeral migration, and glenoid component loosening. The purpose of this paper was to evaluate the incidence of post-TSA rotator cuff tears or dysfunction in osteoarthritic patients. A systematic review of multiple databases was performed using preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses guidelines. Levels I-IV evidence clinical studies of patients with primary osteoarthritis with a minimum 2-year follow-up were included. Fifteen studies with 1259 patients (1338 shoulders) were selected. Student's t-tests were used with a significant alpha value of 0.05. All patients demonstrated significant improvements in motion and validated clinical outcome scores (P < 0.001). Radiographic humeral head migration was the most commonly reported data point for extrapolation of rotator cuff integrity. After 6.6 ± 3.1 years, 29.9 ± 20.7% of shoulders demonstrated superior humeral head migration and 17.9 ± 14.3% migrated a distance more than 25% of the head. This was associated with an 11.3 ± 7.9% incidence of postoperative superior cuff tears. The incidence of radiographic anterior humeral head migration was 11.9 ± 15.9%, corresponding to a 3.0 ± 13.6% rate of subscapularis tears. We found an overall 1.2 ± 4.5% rate of reoperation for cuff injury. Nearly all studies reported indirect markers of rotator cuff dysfunction, such as radiographic humeral head migration and clinical exam findings. This systematic review suggests that rotator cuff dysfunction following TSA may be more common than previously reported. IV, systematic review of Levels I-IV studies.","Purpose: The present study was conducted to find the preferred mode of learning among first-year preclinical students and compare the preferred mode of learning with sex, faculty of students, and academic performance of the students using the VARK questionnaire. Methods: A cross-sectional study was done among 142 first-year Bachelor of Medicine–Bachelor of Surgery and Bachelor of Dental Surgery students from February to May 2018. Demographic data and various academic performance marks were recorded for each individual. VARK (visual, aural, read/write and kinesthetic) questionnaire version 7.8 was administered to calculate the score of each component. Mean VARK scores were calculated and each student classified by their preferred mode of learning. The preferred mode of learning was compared with sex, nationality, faculty of students, and academic performance using χ2, unpaired t-tests, and the Mann–Whitney U test. P<0.05 was taken as statistically significant for comparison. Results: A majority of the students (53.52%) were multimodal. The most common multimodal mode of preference was bimodal (26.06%), while the most common unimodal preference was kinesthetic (29.06%). Total V score, K score, and VARK score were higher among males, while A and R scores were higher among females. The K score (7.96±2.35 in males and 6.96±2.43 in females) differed significantly (P=0.019) between male and female subjects. More subjects with higher scores in the theory exam of anatomy were unimodal learners (53.8%) compared to multimodal learners (46.2%). Conclusion: From this study, it can be concluded that undergraduate students were diverse in their learning styles, but most were multimodal. Though learning styles were found to vary by sex, nationality, and academic performance, differences were not statistically significant.","Background Medical students face greater academic stress and devote more time to their studies due to the tough nature of medical education, at the cost of sleep and physical activity. Good sleep quality and physical activity improve the mental ability and academic performance of the students. Objectives and rationale The study aims to assess sleep quality and physical activity levels among fourth-year MBBS students of Rawalpindi Medical University. We compare these levels with gender and boarding status and correlate them with the academic performance of the students. This may provide new target areas to improve the academics of students performing below average. Materials and methods It was a descriptive, cross-sectional study conducted in March 2019 on 344 medical students enrolled in the fourth-year MBBS class of Rawalpindi Medical University. Sleep quality was assessed by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), physical activity levels by the Global Physical Activity Questionnaire (GPAQ), and academic performance by the marks attained in the most recent pathology class test. The students who could not prepare for the test in the usual manner were excluded from the study. Two-hundred nineteen (219) students were part of the final study sample. Data analysis was performed using SPSS v.22.0 (IBM Corp, Armonk, NY, US). A chi-squared test, independent samples t-test, Pearson’s correlation, and a multiple linear regression model were used to assess the variables. Results Sleep quality and physical activity were significantly correlated with academic performance (p-values of the chi-square and t-test were <0.000). Pearson’s correlation coefficient was -0.69 for PSQI (p<0.000) and 0.62 for GPAQ (p 0.003) with test scores. Gender showed significant association with sleep and physical activity levels (male students had better physical activity level and poorer sleep quality than female students) but no association with test scores. Boarding status was significantly associated with all three variables. Boarders had lower mean test scores and poorer sleep and physical activity indices as compared to non-boarders. The multiple linear regression model was valid (p-value of the F test was <0.000), with beta coefficients of -2.53 ( p=0.002) for sleep quality and 1.37 (p=0.01) for physical activity. The R2 value was 0.84 (84%). Conclusions Our study indicates an overall poor sleep quality and physical activity level among fourth-year medical students, particularly boarding students, who have lower test scores and worse sleep and physical activity levels. In general, male students have better GPAQ scores and female students have better PSQI scores. Both the PSQI and GPAQ scores are significantly correlated with test scores and provide potential target areas to improve the exam performance of the students.",14.5154122607752,4,"test_anxieti, stress, anxieti"

Presently, teachers try to increase students' participation and their active attention to course content by incorporating effective, applicable, low-cost, and enjoyable teaching apparatuses. Methods: The participants of this quasi-experimental study were the students of speech therapy in 4th semester (n=83) at Ahvaz Jundishapur University of Medical Sciences. They were simple-randomly divided into two groups of experimental (who received the crossword puzzle accompanied by lecture or the hybrid method as Group A) and control (who received the traditional method as Group B). The students' knowledge level and students' satisfaction with their received instruction methods were assessed as outcome measures throughout the experiment for both groups. The test score of students' initial knowledge of the concepts in Speech Therapy, the score from the semester final exam of the courses in forms of multiple choice questions, and the retained learning score were calculated as the pre-test, post-test and a follow-up measurement, respectively. Independent-samples T-test for comparative analyses of students' satisfaction between the pre-test and post-test, and multivariate repeated measures ANOVA test were used to analyze the students' knowledge level at three time-points (before, immediately after, and one month after the trainings). The data were analyzed using SPSS ver. 18.0 software, and at the level of statistical significance of P≤0.05. Results: Both educational methods significantly improved the students' knowledge level after the trainings (P=0.030); however, the mean score of knowledge and learning of Group A (mean=17.14) were significantly higher than that of Group B (mean=16.02) immediately after (P=0.036) and one month after the trainings (mean=18.26 vs. 16.10) (P=0.001). The mean score of students' satisfaction in Group A was also significantly higher than that in Group B (P=0.010). Conclusion: Utilizing the crossword puzzle as an enjoyable and participatory teaching tool accompanied by lecture could improve management quality in Speech Therapy sessions.","The flipped classroom (FC) teaching has been increasingly employed in medical education. Many studies have shown this “student-centered” pedagogical model improves students' overall achievement in the course, with students showing more motivation and better self-directed learning skills when compared to the traditional classroom teaching. However, most of the previous studies have been evaluating the short-term effects of FC teaching conducted upon completion of the course. The retention of the promotion and the long-term effects on learning of students' subsequent courses deserve further attention and evaluation. By adopting and running FC teaching in the whole course of physiology, this study aimed to determine the short-term impact of FC teaching on students' learning of physiology course and also the long-term influences in students' learning of follow-up medical curriculums within 18 months after the completion of physiology course. 119 sophomore students majoring in clinical medicine from Central South University were recruited and they were assigned randomly into two groups: the control group (n =61) who received the traditional lecture (TL) teaching, and the experimental group (n =58), who received the FC teaching. In this study, students' final exam scores were used to assess their learning effectiveness and an independent samples t-test was conducted to compare scores between the two groups. Our study showed that FC teaching significantly improved the learning outcome of physiology in the experimental group compared with the control group (P = 0.0001) without obvious impact on the learning of other subjects conducted in the same period of time. Moreover, our results also demonstrated the long-term benefit of FC teaching, with students from the experimental group scoring higher in pathophysiology (P = 0.006), pathology (P = 0.029), pharmacology (P = 0.0089), diagnostics (P = 0.01) and internal medicine (P = 0.0004) than those from the control group. The study results indicate that FC is a promising teaching approach to increase students' learning effectiveness in physiology course, and the long-term effects of FC facilitate the learning of the follow-up medical courses. Furthermore, this study also demonstrates that although the time investment on physiology is increased by FC teaching, it does not weaken students' learning of other courses conducted in the same period of time.","Introduction: Student-generated questions can be a very helpful tool in medical education. The use of this activity can allow the students to feel more involved in the subjects covered and may improve their knowledge and learning. The aim of this study was to identify the effect of question-writing activity as a stimulus factor on learning in midwifery students and determine their perception about this activity. Methods: This quasi-experimental study with two groups of pre- and post-tests was conducted on two groups of midwifery students who had taken the immunology course. Two classes of midwifery students (N=62) participated and were randomly assigned to two different groups. One class was selected as the experimental group (n=32) and the other class was considered as the control group (n=30). The experimental group’s students were asked to write questions covering different topics of the syllabus components taught during 15 weeks from February 2016 to May 2016. They were asked to write, answer and explain their multiple-choice questions (MCQs). The students’ performance in immunology course was compared between the two groups at the end of the semester. After their final exam, we asked them to fill in a questionnaire on their views about this activity. The data were analyzed by independent t- test using SPSS software, version 18. Results: The differences between pre- and post-test mean scores of the experimental and control groups were 24.53±5.74 and 20.63±5.58, respectively. The results of independent t-test showed that these differences in the two groups were significant (p=0.009). Nevertheless, most of the students stated that question-writing activity as a learning tool is an unfamiliar exercise and unpopular learning strategy. Conclusion: Results showed that question writing by students has been found to promote learning when it is implemented as a part of the teaching curriculum in immunology course; therefore, this activity could be effective in improving the students’ learning.","The integrated mechanisms of heart contraction are some of the most complex processes for undergraduate biomedical students to understand. Visual models have the potential to enhance learning environments by providing visual representations of complex mechanisms. Despite their benefits, the use of visual models in undergraduate classrooms is still limited. For this study, we tested the effect of a learning sequence of activities related to the cardiac cycle using an augmented reality (AR) application for smartphones and tablets. We were interested in understanding the ability of students to draw and label figures reflecting cardiac function after experiencing the learning sequence using AR. Undergraduate students of the biomedical sciences (control n = 43, experimental n = 58) were enrolled in the course, and their drawings were evaluated using multiple levels of complexity (1 = basic to 5 = complex) through a pre-/posttest structure that included a learning sequence based on AR in the experimental group and regular lecture-based activities in the control group. The complexity of students' drawings was evaluated on the anatomical, physiological, and molecular aspects of heart contraction. We used Cohen's kappa index for interrater reliability when determining the complexity of drawings. Control and experimental groups showed no differences in baseline knowledge (preexamination quiz). The students who experienced the AR activities showed an increase in the complexity of representation levels in posttest results and also showed a significant difference in scores for the final exam in the heart physiology course. Our results indicate that using AR enhances the comprehension of anatomical and physiological concepts of the cardiac cycle for undergraduate biomedical students.","By taking notes students could save time for reading all textbooks for their exams or for their representations. Taking notes increases attention of students to read or heard materials, and this increases their comprehension. Thus, the present study is important because note-taking could help them to remember what they learnt, absolutely important information. The method used in this research was survey. The 40 Persian EFL learners were selected from a language institute in Karaj to participate in the present study. These learners were divided into two groups; one of them is experimental group (N=20) and the other one is control group (N=20). Pretest and post test were two instruments that were used to carry out this study, a pretest about skill of note-taking of passages of the lessons was used for both experimental and control group. This test consisted of 4 passages. The same test was administrated again as the post test for both groups by the end of the course to see the different conclusion between taking note of experimental group and control group. Reliability between 4 texts is in oscillation from 0.6 to 0.81 (from 0.6 upwards). Therefore this reliability was an acceptable one. To analyze data descriptive statistics (that was contained percentage, frequency and mean score) and also inferential statistics (that was contained ANOVA, Pearson correlation, independent sample t-test, multivariate’s test, regression) were carried out by using SPSS16 soft ware. The findings confirmed that note taking is effective in reading comprehension.","This study evaluates the use of role-playing games (RPGs) as a methodological approach for teaching cellular biology, assessing student satisfaction, learning outcomes, and retention of acquired knowledge. First-year undergraduate medical students at two Brazilian public universities attended either an RPG-based class (RPG group) or a lecture (lecture-based group) on topics related to cellular biology. Pre- and post-RPG-based class questionnaires were compared to scores in regular exams and in an unannounced test one year later to assess students' attitudes and learning. From the 230 students that attended the RPG classes, 78.4% responded that the RPG-based classes were an effective tool for learning; 55.4% thought that such classes were better than lectures but did not replace them; and 81% responded that they would use this method. The lecture-based group achieved a higher grade in 1 of 14 regular exam questions. In the medium-term evaluation (one year later), the RPG group scored higher in 2 of 12 questions. RPG classes are thus quantitatively as effective as formal lectures, are well accepted by students, and may serve as educational tools, giving students the chance to learn actively and potentially retain the acquired knowledge more efficiently.","Background Although recent studies report on the benefits of blended learning in improving medical student education, there is still no empirical evidence on the relative effectiveness of blended over traditional learning approaches in medical statistics. We implemented blended along with on-site (i.e. face-to-face) learning to further assess the potential value of web-based learning in medical statistics. Methods This was a prospective study conducted with third year medical undergraduate students attending the Faculty of Medicine, University of Belgrade, who passed (440 of 545) the final exam of the obligatory introductory statistics course during 2013–14. Student statistics achievements were stratified based on the two methods of education delivery: blended learning and on-site learning. Blended learning included a combination of face-to-face and distance learning methodologies integrated into a single course. Results Mean exam scores for the blended learning student group were higher than for the on-site student group for both final statistics score (89.36±6.60 vs. 86.06±8.48; p = 0.001) and knowledge test score (7.88±1.30 vs. 7.51±1.36; p = 0.023) with a medium effect size. There were no differences in sex or study duration between the groups. Current grade point average (GPA) was higher in the blended group. In a multivariable regression model, current GPA and knowledge test scores were associated with the final statistics score after adjusting for study duration and learning modality (p<0.001). Conclusion This study provides empirical evidence to support educator decisions to implement different learning environments for teaching medical statistics to undergraduate medical students. Blended and on-site training formats led to similar knowledge acquisition; however, students with higher GPA preferred the technology assisted learning format. Implementation of blended learning approaches can be considered an attractive, cost-effective, and efficient alternative to traditional classroom training in medical statistics.","The purpose of this study is to determine if the type of weekly evaluation method used in an online course contributes to a difference in the learning outcomes for students. Two methods for the ongoing evaluation of student learning were analyzed for differences in learning outcomes as demonstrated by mid-term and final exam test scores. Using an experimental design, students that enrolled in either a Disease Control course or an Epidemiology course were randomized into one of two sections in each course. Holding the course parameters the same except for the weekly evaluation type (homework or quiz), bivariate analysis using independent t tests supported that sections were similar in both courses with respect to test scores. A statistically significant difference did occur between final exam scores in the Disease Control course with the higher scores occurring in the quiz section. End of course student satisfaction surveys were similar for both types of evaluation methods and for both courses. Of the students that responded to the surveys, the majority felt their overall learning experience was either good or very good, regardless of whether they completed weekly interactive homework assignments or automated quizzes. This study supports the idea that learning outcomes and student satisfaction scores with a weekly automated quiz are equivalent or improved over the more interactive weekly homework assignments in select courses. The Journal of Educators Online, Volume 3, Number 2, July 2006","BACKGROUND Teaching programmes in medical education are now routinely employing active learning strategies to enhance the learning process and engage students in higher levels of learning. Team-based learning (TBL) is one active learning strategy that builds on individuals' strengths by allowing them to collaborate and work as a team to achieve a common learning objective. AIMS The present study aims to evaluate the impact of TBL on student performance. It also aims to assess students' attitudes towards TBL and the feasibility of its incorporation into the course curriculum. METHODS From a class of 241 students, 128 who agreed to participate in the study underwent two sessions of TBL each consisting of Individual and Group Readiness Assurance Tests (IRATs and GRATs). The readiness assurance tests each had 13 multiple choice questions (MCQ). To analyse the impact of TBL supplementation, the median sessional MCQ scores of students who underwent TBL supplementation (group 1) were compared with those who did not undergo the session (group 2). Students' experiences with TBL and their attitudes towards incorporation of TBL into the course curriculum were analysed using a feedback questionnaire that was given to students who underwent TBL. RESULTS Students belonging to the TBL group performed significantly better than the students who did not undergo TBL (p<0.001). The median sessional MCQ score of the TBL group was seven and non-TBL group was six. The overall mean attitude score obtained from feedback questionnaires was 3.57, which indicates a positive attitude towards TBL. CONCLUSION The team-based learning session improved student engagement with course content. The majority of the students felt that TBL supplementation enhanced their understanding of course content and believe that it will help them perform better in their exams.","Abstract Objective: To evaluate whether computer-based learning (CBL) improves newly acquired knowledge and is an effective strategy for teaching prenatal ultrasound diagnostic skills to third-year medical students when compared with instruction by traditional paper-based methods (PBM). Study Design: We conducted a randomized, prospective study involving volunteer junior (3rd year) medical students consecutively rotating through the Obstetrics and Gynecology clerkship during six months of the 2005-2006 academic year. The students were randomly assigned to permuted blocks and divided into two groups. Half of the participants received instruction in prenatal ultrasound diagnostics using an interactive CBL program; the other half received instruction using equivalent material by the traditional PBM. Outcomes were evaluated by comparing changes in pre-tutorial and post instruction examination scores. Results: All 36 potential participants (100%) completed the study curriculum. Students were divided equally between the CBL (n=18) and PBM (n=18) groups. Pre-tutorial exam scores (mean ± s.d.) were 44% ± 11.1% for the CBL group and 44% ± 10.8% for the PBL cohort, indicating no statistically significant differences (p > 0.05) between the two groups. After instruction, post-tutorial exam scores (mean ± s.d.) were increased from the pre-tutorial scores, 74% ± 11% and 67% ± 12%, for students in the CBL and the PBM groups, respectively. The improvement in post-tutorial exam scores from the pre-test scores was considered significant (p < 0.05). When post-test scores for the tutorial groups were compared, the CBL subjects achieved a score that was, on average, 7 percentage points higher than their PBM counterparts, a statistically significant difference (p < 0.05). Conclusion: Instruction by either CBL or PBM strategies is associated with improvements in newly acquired knowledge as reflected by increased post-tutorial examination scores. Students that received CBL had significantlyhigher post-tutorial exam scores than those in the PBM group, indicating that CBL is an effective instruction strategy in this setting.",24.5477513637351,3,"teach, control, effect"

Student and faculty concerns about compromised academic integrity and actual instances of academic dishonesty in assessments, especially with online testing, are increasingly troublesome. Recent research suggests that in the absence of proctoring, the time taken to complete an exam increases significantly and online test results are inflated. This study uses a randomized design in seven sections of an online course to examine test scores from 97 students and time taken to complete online tests with and without proctoring software, controlling for exam difficulty, course design, instructor effects, and student majors. Results from fixed effects estimated from a fitted statistical model showed a significant advantage in quiz performance (7-9 points on a 100 point quiz) when students were not proctored, with all other variables statistically accounted for. Larger grade disparities and longer testing times were observed on the most difficult quizzes, and with factors that reflected the perception of high stakes of the quiz grades. Overall, use of proctoring software resulted in lower quiz scores, shorter quiz taking times, and less variation in quiz performance across exams, implying greater compliance with academic integrity compared with when quizzes were taken without proctoring software.","Online education continues to grow, bringing opportunities and challenges for students and instructors. One challenge is the perception that academic integrity associated with online tests is compromised due to undetected cheating that yields artificially higher grades. To address these concerns, proctoring software has been developed to address and prevent academic dishonesty. The purpose of this study was to compare online test results from proctored versus unproctored online tests. Test performance of 147 students enrolled in multiple sections of an online course were compared using linear mixed effects models with nearly half the students having no proctoring and the remainder required to use online proctoring software. Students scored, on average, 17 points lower [95% CI: 14, 20] and used significantly less time in online tests that used proctoring software versus unproctored tests. Significant grade disparity and different time usage occurred on different exams, both across and within sections of the same course where some students used test proctoring software and others did not. Implications and suggestions for incorporating strategic interventions to address integrity, addressing disparate test scores, and validating student knowledge in online classes are discussed.","We tested the hypothesis that highly structured course designs, which implement reading quizzes and/or extensive in-class active-learning activities and weekly practice exams, can lower failure rates in an introductory biology course for majors, compared with low-structure course designs that are based on lecturing and a few high-risk assessments. We controlled for 1) instructor effects by analyzing data from quarters when the same instructor taught the course, 2) exam equivalence with new assessments called the Weighted Bloom's Index and Predicted Exam Score, and 3) student equivalence using a regression-based Predicted Grade. We also tested the hypothesis that points from reading quizzes, clicker questions, and other “practice” assessments in highly structured courses inflate grades and confound comparisons with low-structure course designs. We found no evidence that points from active-learning exercises inflate grades or reduce the impact of exams on final grades. When we controlled for variation in student ability, failure rates were lower in a moderately structured course design and were dramatically lower in a highly structured course design. This result supports the hypothesis that active-learning exercises can make students more skilled learners and help bridge the gap between poorly prepared students and their better-prepared peers.",This study was designed to measure students’ voluntary use of retrieval practice as a review tool. Students who used test-based reviews scored higher on exams than students who used reading-based reviews. Showing students exam performance associated with test- vs. reading-based reviews coincided with a significant increase in use of test-based reviews.,"The introduction of computer-based testing in high-stakes examining in higher education is developing rather slowly due to institutional barriers (the need of extra facilities, ensuring test security) and teacher and student acceptance. From the existing literature it is unclear whether computer-based exams will result in similar results as paper-based exams and whether student acceptance can change as a result of administering computer-based exams. In this study, we compared results from a computer-based and paper-based exam in a sample of psychology students and found no differences in total scores across the two modes. Furthermore, we investigated student acceptance and change in acceptance of computer-based examining. After taking the computer-based exam, fifty percent of the students preferred paper-and-pencil exams over computer-based exams and about a quarter preferred a computer-based exam. We conclude that computer-based exam total scores are similar as paper-based exam scores, but that for the acceptance of high-stakes computer-based exams it is important that students practice and get familiar with this new mode of test administration.","Prior research has established that students often underprepare for midterm examinations yet remain overconfident in their proficiency. Research concerning the testing effect has demonstrated that utilizing testing as a study strategy leads to higher performance and more accurate confidence compared to more common study strategies such as rereading or reviewing homework problems. We report on three experiments that explore the viability of using computer adaptive testing (CAT) for assessing students’ physics proficiency, for preparing students for midterm exams by diagnosing their weaknesses, and for predicting scores in midterm exams in an introductory calculus-based mechanics course for science and engineering majors. The first two experiments evaluated the reliability and validity of the CAT algorithm. In addition, we investigated the ability of the CAT test to predict performance on the midterm exam. The third experiment explored whether completing two CAT tests in the days before a midterm exam would facilitate performance on the midterm exam. Scores on the CAT tests and the midterm exams were significantly correlated and, on average, were not statistically different from each other. This provides evidence for moderate parallel-forms reliability and criterion-related validity of the CAT algorithm. In addition, when used as a diagnostic tool, CAT showed promise in helping students perform better on midterm exams. Finally, we found that the CAT tests predicted the average performance on the midterm exams reasonably well, however, the CAT tests were not as accurate as desired at predicting the performance of individual students. While CAT shows promise for practice testing, more research is needed to refine testing algorithms to increase reliability before implementing CAT for summative evaluations. In light of these findings, we believe that more research is needed comparing CAT to traditional paper-and-pencil practice tests in order to determine whether the effort needed to create a CAT system is worthwhile.","To test the hypothesis that adding course structure may encourage self-regulated learning skills resulting in an increase in student exam performance in the community college setting, we added daily preclass online, open-book reading quizzes to an introductory biology course. We compared three control terms without reading quizzes and three experimental terms with online, open-book reading quizzes; the instructor of record, class size, and instructional time did not vary. Analyzing the Bloom’s taxonomy level of a random sample of exam questions indicated a similar cognitive level of high-stakes assessments across all six terms in the study. To control for possible changes in student preparation or ability over time, we calculated each student’s grade point average in courses other than biology during the term under study and included it as a predictor variable in our regression models. Our final model showed that students in the experimental terms had significantly higher exam scores than students in the control terms. This result shows that online reading quizzes can boost achievement in community college students. We also comment on the importance of discipline-based education research in community college settings and the structure of our community college/4-year institution collaboration.","We identify the student characteristics most associated with success in an introductory business statistics class, placing special focus on the relationship between student math skills and course performance, as measured by student grade in the course. To determine which math skills are important for student success, we examine (1) whether the student has taken calculus or business calculus, (2) whether the student has been required to take remedial mathematics, (3) the student's score on a test of very basic mathematical concepts, (4) student scores on the mathematics portion of the ACT exam, and (5) science/reasoning portion of the ACT exam. The score on the science portion of the ACT exam and the math-quiz score are significantly related to performance in an introductory statistics course, as are student GPA and gender. This result is robust across course formats and instructors. These results have implications for curriculum development, course content, and course prerequisites.","Achievement test scores are used to diagnose strengths, weaknesses, and a basis for awarding prizes, scholarship, or degrees. They are also used in evaluating the influences of course of study, teachers, teaching methods, and other factors considered to be significant in educational practice. Still, sometimes there is a gap in the score of essay tests and the existing knowledge of examinees. In the present study, the relationship between writing skill and the academic achievement of Iranian EFL students was examined to find a logical connection between them. The results of four final exams as content scores were examined and scored again in term of writing ability in analytical scoring scheme according to IELTS criteria. Then the average of two sets of scores calculated by two raters was compared with content scores of the same tests. The results showed that correlation between content score of all students and their writing skills is meaningful at 0.01 level of significance. The results showed that there is a strong relationship between EFL students' degree of content score and their writing skill.","Significance Increasing access to Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) fields can create career opportunities. Yet many students, especially those from lower-income backgrounds, find the high-stakes exams in courses necessary for STEM success to be stressful and anxiety provoking. Such experiences of stress can lead to underperformance and compromise students’ ability to advance in STEM. We show that lower-income students given the opportunity to emotionally regulate their worries and reinterpret their arousal go on to perform better on their high school science exams and endorse a more adaptive interpretation of stress. Critically, emotion regulation interventions cut in half the course failure rate for lower-income students. For many students, success is based on more than STEM knowledge—their ability to regulate emotions is important too. Educational attainment is one lever that can increase opportunity for economically disadvantaged families—especially in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM). Unfortunately, students from lower-income backgrounds often perform poorly and fail high school STEM courses, which are a necessary step in pursuing fast-growing and lucrative STEM careers, graduating high school, and matriculating to college. We reasoned that, because high school STEM courses often use high-stakes tests to gauge performance, and such tests can be especially stressful for lower-income students, interventions that help students regulate their negative emotions during tests should reduce the achievement gap between higher- and lower-income students. In a large-scale (n = 1,175) field experiment conducted in ninth grade science classrooms, students were asked to complete a control exercise, or they were given the opportunity to complete an exercise to help them regulate their worries and reinterpret their anxious arousal before their tests. We found significant benefits of emotion regulation activities for lower-income students in terms of their science examination scores, science course passing rate, and students’ attitudes toward examination stress, suggesting that students’ emotions are one factor that impacts performance. For example, 39% of lower-income students failed the course in the control group compared with only 18% of students failing the course if they participated in the emotion regulation interventions—a reduction in course failure rate by half. Our work underscores the crucial importance of targeting students’ emotions during impactful points in their academic trajectories for improving STEM preparedness and enhancing overall academic success.",22.0335416624642,1,"compar, higher, grade"
