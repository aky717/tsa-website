Today, the crop supports thousands of producers; their communities; and large industries for supplies, transportation. processing, and marketing. The lives of many Kansans revolve around the life cycle of wheat. Producers plant the crop when conditions are favorable in autumn; anxiously hope that the plants will survive cold, drought, and wind during winter and spring; and then suspend most other farming operations and social activities to harvest the grain in early summer. Equipment and fertilizer dealers extend their hours of operation to provide supplies that producers need during critical periods. Elevator operators add help and stay open late to take in the grain during harvest, and railroads and truckers add equipment to move it to market. Media and markets follow the progress of the crop, its condition, and the yield and quality of the harvested grain. Millers then process more wheat for food in Kansas than in any other state. The crop that directly or indirectly provides the daily bread for so many Kansans is not native to the state or even to the US. Wheat originated centuries ago in a part of the world that gave mankind many of its most important foods, and the basic characteristics of the plant that we grow were shaped by early humans. Even today, many of the traits for developing improved varieties in Kansas come from numerous other countries.","Biorefineries are keen to design optimal biomass supply chains to minimize production, harvest, transport, and other costs. Such a design problem is challenging with the availability of multiple feedstocks (agricultural residues, perennials such as energy crops, short rotation woody crops), sourced from multiple harvest sheds, and transported across multiple modes (trucks, rails, and barges). This paper presents a multi-period optimization model to analyze the feasibility of collection from multiple harvest sheds. The results are demonstrated for a case study location in Alpena, MI served by truck and water transport. The model results suggest that: i) perennial biomass with higher yields would be preferred due to higher biomass production per unit area; ii) transport from farther locations are warranted only if the biomass production costs in the farther harvest sheds are cheaper by 20% - 30% compared to the adjacent harvest shed; and iii) the local situations of a biorefinery—characterized by the parametric inputs in the model—play a key role in determining the optimal feedstock composition across multiple harvest sheds. The results also support long term contracts associated with high yielding perennial feedstocks such as energy crops and short rotation woody crops.","This study evaluated the yield performance of the tomato hybrids 'DS0060', 'Thaise' and 'Trucker' in the open field and environments protected by agricultural film (F) and polycarbonate panels (P) during the Amazonian summer. In the protected environment, the crops produced significantly higher yields than in the open field. 'Thaise' has high thermotolerance and is adaptable to a wide temperature range, making it the best-performing hybrid in environment F. Highest yields were found for 'Thaise' in environment F or P (86.2 and 92.5 t ha-1) together with 'DS0060' and 'Trucker' in environment F (75.3 and 88.2 t ha-1), demonstrating the high yield potential in the interim growing season (January to April). In the open field, the fruit color was paler, fruit flesh firmer and ripening index lower. In environment F, the fruits contained highest levels of soluble solids, lycopene and β-carotene. 'Thaise' contained higher concentrations of these two compounds. Under environment P, the yield of the evaluated tomato hybrids increased considerably, indicating it as a promising possibility for tomato cultivation in tropical regions. 'Thaíse' stood out with high yield and good quality traits, when grown in an F or P environment. These results prove the viability of tomato production as interim crop in tropical regions, under high rainfall and heat, as well as the difference protected environments make for tomato cultivation, in particular the choice of the most suitable cover material for the crop, to ensure high yields coupled with desirable quality properties.","Cassava is one of the most important cash crops in Cambodia. Agricultural mechanization promotes productivity, but overinvestment may disrupt the balance between inputs and outputs. Depending on the production scale, sometimes hiring equipment is considered better than purchasing it. While we can hypothesize that mechanization and investments might be crucial factors of productivity, technical efficiency analysis for estimating their effects has not yet been conducted. Therefore, this study investigates the impact of mechanization and investments on cassava yield and producers’ technical efficiency in Cambodia using the Cobb-Douglas stochastic frontier production model. For the study, 205 respondents were randomly selected and interviewed in the Battambang and Pailin provinces in northwestern Cambodia in 2017. Our results show that tractor or truck-hire cost was positively significant, and the cassava uprooting machine-hire cost was negatively significant. The average technical efficiency score of 0.62 indicates that cassava producers can increase their level of technical efficiency. Although cassava production in Cambodia is mechanized and investors are investing, it would be more beneficial to producers if they were provided with financial assistance when uprooting the cassava at the harvest time. Appropriate control of input costs can effectively improve cassava yield, following the implementation of the National Policy on Cassava 2020–2025 by the Royal Government of Cambodia.","Mopani District Municipality in the northeast of South Africa is largely semi-arid and frequently affected by meteorological droughts. The recent 2015/16 event had devastating impacts on water levels, crop yields, livestock herds and rural livelihoods. We investigated the nature of the drought hazard; its impacts, including vulnerability of rural communities in Mopani District and adaptation strategies they have employed to cope with drought. A mixed methods approach with both quantitative and qualitative datasets was used. The district was divided into two distinct climatic areas: the drier eastern lowveld and the wetter western bushveld. Questionnaires were administered among community members whilst key informant interviews were conducted among relevant government and municipal officials. Climate data was used to characterize historical drought using a Standardized Precipitation and Evapotranspiration Index whilst vegetation anomaly maps were used to demonstrate impacts. Spatially distinct patterns of drought conditions were evident with harsh and dry conditions towards the east. It was found that nearly half the time there is some form of drought or another in the district mostly linked to the remote El Nino phenomenon. In several areas, rain-fed agriculture is no longer tenable, with a direct impact on rural livelihoods. A Household Vulnerability Index determined variable levels of vulnerability such that different strategies are employed to adapt to drought some of which cause environmental problems. Local government intervention strategies include supply of seeds and fertilisers, providing cheap fodder and supplying water using trucks. The findings of this study contribute to disaster risk reduction efforts in a region that is highly vulnerable to current and future climate-risks.","Phalaenopsis orchids are an increasingly popular potted house plant in the United States. New cultivars have a long display life in home environments, but these epiphytes are often overirrigated by consumers. Irrigating potted Phalaenopsis orchids weekly with ice cubes has been recommended as a simple solution to help consumers, but concern has been raised about whether the ice cubes will cause low temperature damage in these tropical plants. The effect of ice cube irrigation on the display life and quality of four cultivars of potted Phalaenopsis orchids was, therefore, evaluated. Irrigation treatments includedweekly application of three ice cubes or the equivalent volume of room-temperature tap water. The longevity of individual flowers and the overall display life of the orchid plants were determined. Monthly measurements determined the volume of leachate in the outer decorative pots after irrigation. The quantum yield of photosystem II (FPSII) in roots and leaves was evaluatedmonthly to determine if photosynthetic efficiencywas affected by the ice irrigation. The temperature in the orchid bark growing media during irrigation events was recorded, and a programmable antifreeze bath was used to determine the temperature at which damage to PSII was observed in orchid roots. The flower longevity and display life were unaffected by irrigation treatment. In general, the leachate volume over time was the same or lower in ice irrigated orchids comparedwith those irrigatedwith the same volume of water. The lowest temperature in the barkmedia irrigated with ice cubes was’11 8C, while controlled freezing experiments showed that damage to photosystem II in orchid roots did not occur until bath temperatures were belowL7 8C. The internal temperature of roots in direct contactwith ice cubes decreased to around 4 8C. Ice cube irrigation had no detrimental effects on the quality or display life of potted Phalaenopsis orchids growing in bark, demonstrating that ice cubes are a viable method of irrigating these tropical house plants. Orchids are currently the top-selling potted flowering plant in the United States because of their long flower life and compact growth (Banks, 2005; Fitch, 2004; USDA, 2016). While the popularity of many potted plants is declining, the number of orchids that are sold each year is increasing. Most commercial orchid sales are Phalaenopsis sp., also called moth orchids (Griesbach, 2002). The USDA Floriculture Crops Summary reported the wholesale value of potted orchids (including Phalaenopsis) to be $288 million in 2015, an increase of $15 million over the 2014 value (USDA, 2016). The introduction of improved hybrids and the development of large-scale production protocols that reduce the time required to produce flowering plants have allowed potted orchids to be grown for mass-market consumers (Griesbach, 2002). Phalaenopsis species, which originate from tropical and subtropical climates, have a long flower display life in the typical temperatures and low light levels of a home (Banks, 2005). These orchids are epiphytic in their native environments and grow on trees with their roots exposed to the air (Banks, 2005). The roots of Phalaenopsis orchids contain chlorophyll and are photosynthetic (Dycus and Knudson, 1957; Lopez and Runkle, 2005). Commercial production of Phalaenopsis is usually in a bark-based potting media that allows for good aeration and drainage (Griesbach, 2002). In the home environment, proper irrigation is the largest challenge to maintaining a healthy potted orchid. Underwatering the plant will result in wrinkled, flaccid leaves, whereas overwatering or letting the orchid sit in water can result in damaged roots (Cullina, 2004). Healthy roots of Phalaenopsis are vivid green when the plant is well-watered, and they have a silvery hue when dry. Unhealthy roots are tan or brown (Cullina, 2004). The technique of irrigating Phalaenopsis orchids with ice cubes has been recommended to orchid owners to reduce the likelihood of overor underwatering the plants (Onofrey, 2009). Ice cubes provide a convenient way to apply a set volume of water, which is released slowly as the ice melts. The idea is that the ice melt will move slowly through the porous bark media, allowing more water to be absorbed by the bark and roots and resulting in less water accumulation in the bottom of pots where it may cause root damage. Concerns about this technique include whether the melting ice will provide enough water for proper plant growth and whether the ice will cause low temperature damage or reduce the display life of the plants (Cullina, 2004). Even brief exposure to low temperatures can cause chilling injury (CI) in tropical species (Wang, 2007). Mesophyll cell collapse is a physiological disorder that can occur in orchid leaves exposed to low air or water temperatures (Cating and Palmateer, 2009; Sheehan, 2002). Symptoms include the development of sunken, light-green to yellow areas on the upper surfaces of the leaves, which then turn brown and necrotic. The severity of the CI is dependent on the temperature, duration of exposure, and physiological age of the leaves (McConnell and Sheehan, 1978). Exposure to 2 C for 8 h causes mesophyll cell collapse in Phalaenopsis leaves. Water soaked spots on the upper surface of the leaves can be observed 0.5 h after removal from the chilling temperature treatment and these progress to deeply sunken dark brown spots within 3 weeks (McConnell and Sheehan, 1978). While CI can be induced in the leaves of some Phalaenopsis species at temperatures below 10 C, there is no information about root damage or what temperatures the roots experience when plants are irrigated with ice cubes. The objectives of this research were to 1) evaluate the effect of ice cube irrigation on the flower longevity, display life, and quality of potted Phalaenopsis orchids growing in bark; 2) measure the temperature of the bark Received for publication 13 June 2017.

Materials and Methods Plant material. Potted orchids (Phalaenopsis sp.) were received on 21 Jan. 2016 at the Ohio Agricultural Research and Development Center in Wooster, OH, and on 22 Jan. 2016 at the University of Georgia, Athens, GA. The orchids were transported on a temperature-controlled truck from Green Circle Growers (Oberlin, OH). Plants were growing in a custom bark media (95% bark and 5% sphagnum peatmoss; Oldcastle Lawn and Garden, Columbus, OH) in round, 11.5-cm plastic pots (700 mL volume) inside decorative ceramic pots. The orchids were at a market-ready stage with two flower spikes per plant and three to five open flowers on each spike. Four popular commercial cultivars, 699, 322, 386, and 56-100975, were used in all experiments except where noted. Expt. 1. Evaluating the effects of ice cube irrigation on the quality and display life of potted Phalaenopsis orchids Experimental set up and environmental conditions. Experiments were conducted at two locations (Wooster, OH and Athens, GA) in an interior evaluation room set up to simulate an office or home environment. These locations are referred to as OH and GA, respectively. All windows in the rooms were blocked, and light was provided by fluorescent lights from 8:00 AM to 5:00 PM daily. The average photosynthetic photon flux (PPF) in the room at plant height in OH was 7.8 mmol·m·s, and the range was from 3.0 to 12.5 mmol·m·s across the room (LI-190R Quantum; LI-COR BioSciences, Lincoln, NE). In GA, the PPF was 6.8 mmol·m·s, and the range was 3.7 to 10.0 mmol·m·s across the room (LI-190SA; LICOR BioSciences). The plants were blocked to account for the varying PPF. The temperature set point in each room was 21 C. In OH, a relative humidity around 40% was maintained using a humidifier (Space Saver Evaporative Humidifier Model 831000; Aircare, Little Rock, AZ). The mean relative humidity in GA was 49% ± 9%. The mean room temperature over the entire experiment was 21.2 Cwith a range of 14.5 to 28.7 C in OH (January to July), and a mean of 22.0 C and a range of 14.0 to 26.9 C in GA (January to May). Temperature and humidity were monitored using a Watchdog (Model 2475 Plant Growth Station; Spectrum Technologies Inc., Plainfield, IL) or a temperature/ humidity data logger (Hobo U12; Onset Computers, Bourne, MA). Fans were used to increase air circulation, and in OH, air samples were collected monthly to measure ethylene levels in the evaluation room using a gas chromatograph (Varian 3800; Agilent, Foster City, CA). Ethylene was not detected during the experiment. Treatments. Orchids were arranged on tables in a split-plot randomized complete block design that accounted for the gradient in PPF. The main-plot effects were irrigation treatment (ice vs. water) arranged in six complete blocks (replicates). The subplot effects were cultivar (699, 322, 386, and 56-100975) arranged randomly within e","The role of agricultural machinery interacting with the main soil is performed by its wheels, which either amplify or mitigate adverse effects.

Today, the crop supports thousands of producers; their communities; and large industries for supplies, transportation. processing, and marketing. The lives of many Kansans revolve around the life cycle of wheat. Producers plant the crop when conditions are favorable in autumn; anxiously hope that the plants will survive cold, drought, and wind during winter and spring; and then suspend most other farming operations and social activities to harvest the grain in early summer. Equipment and fertilizer dealers extend their hours of operation to provide supplies that producers need during critical periods. Elevator operators add help and stay open late to take in the grain during harvest, and railroads and truckers add equipment to move it to market. Media and markets follow the progress of the crop, its condition, and the yield and quality of the harvested grain. Millers then process more wheat for food in Kansas than in any other state. The crop that directly or indirectly provides the daily bread for so many Kansans is not native to the state or even to the US. Wheat originated centuries ago in a part of the world that gave mankind many of its most important foods, and the basic characteristics of the plant that we grow were shaped by early humans. Even today, many of the traits for developing improved varieties in Kansas come from numerous other countries.","Biorefineries are keen to design optimal biomass supply chains to minimize production, harvest, transport, and other costs. Such a design problem is challenging with the availability of multiple feedstocks (agricultural residues, perennials such as energy crops, short rotation woody crops), sourced from multiple harvest sheds, and transported across multiple modes (trucks, rails, and barges). This paper presents a multi-period optimization model to analyze the feasibility of collection from multiple harvest sheds. The results are demonstrated for a case study location in Alpena, MI served by truck and water transport. The model results suggest that: i) perennial biomass with higher yields would be preferred due to higher biomass production per unit area; ii) transport from farther locations are warranted only if the biomass production costs in the farther harvest sheds are cheaper by 20% - 30% compared to the adjacent harvest shed; and iii) the local situations of a biorefinery—characterized by the parametric inputs in the model—play a key role in determining the optimal feedstock composition across multiple harvest sheds. The results also support long term contracts associated with high yielding perennial feedstocks such as energy crops and short rotation woody crops.","Mopani District Municipality in the northeast of South Africa is largely semi-arid and frequently affected by meteorological droughts. The recent 2015/16 event had devastating impacts on water levels, crop yields, livestock herds and rural livelihoods. We investigated the nature of the drought hazard; its impacts, including vulnerability of rural communities in Mopani District and adaptation strategies they have employed to cope with drought. A mixed methods approach with both quantitative and qualitative datasets was used. The district was divided into two distinct climatic areas: the drier eastern lowveld and the wetter western bushveld. Questionnaires were administered among community members whilst key informant interviews were conducted among relevant government and municipal officials. Climate data was used to characterize historical drought using a Standardized Precipitation and Evapotranspiration Index whilst vegetation anomaly maps were used to demonstrate impacts. Spatially distinct patterns of drought conditions were evident with harsh and dry conditions towards the east. It was found that nearly half the time there is some form of drought or another in the district mostly linked to the remote El Nino phenomenon. In several areas, rain-fed agriculture is no longer tenable, with a direct impact on rural livelihoods. A Household Vulnerability Index determined variable levels of vulnerability such that different strategies are employed to adapt to drought some of which cause environmental problems. Local government intervention strategies include supply of seeds and fertilisers, providing cheap fodder and supplying water using trucks. The findings of this study contribute to disaster risk reduction efforts in a region that is highly vulnerable to current and future climate-risks.","This study evaluated the yield performance of the tomato hybrids 'DS0060', 'Thaise' and 'Trucker' in the open field and environments protected by agricultural film (F) and polycarbonate panels (P) during the Amazonian summer. In the protected environment, the crops produced significantly higher yields than in the open field. 'Thaise' has high thermotolerance and is adaptable to a wide temperature range, making it the best-performing hybrid in environment F. Highest yields were found for 'Thaise' in environment F or P (86.2 and 92.5 t ha-1) together with 'DS0060' and 'Trucker' in environment F (75.3 and 88.2 t ha-1), demonstrating the high yield potential in the interim growing season (January to April). In the open field, the fruit color was paler, fruit flesh firmer and ripening index lower. In environment F, the fruits contained highest levels of soluble solids, lycopene and β-carotene. 'Thaise' contained higher concentrations of these two compounds. Under environment P, the yield of the evaluated tomato hybrids increased considerably, indicating it as a promising possibility for tomato cultivation in tropical regions. 'Thaíse' stood out with high yield and good quality traits, when grown in an F or P environment. These results prove the viability of tomato production as interim crop in tropical regions, under high rainfall and heat, as well as the difference protected environments make for tomato cultivation, in particular the choice of the most suitable cover material for the crop, to ensure high yields coupled with desirable quality properties.","Cassava is one of the most important cash crops in Cambodia. Agricultural mechanization promotes productivity, but overinvestment may disrupt the balance between inputs and outputs. Depending on the production scale, sometimes hiring equipment is considered better than purchasing it. While we can hypothesize that mechanization and investments might be crucial factors of productivity, technical efficiency analysis for estimating their effects has not yet been conducted. Therefore, this study investigates the impact of mechanization and investments on cassava yield and producers’ technical efficiency in Cambodia using the Cobb-Douglas stochastic frontier production model. For the study, 205 respondents were randomly selected and interviewed in the Battambang and Pailin provinces in northwestern Cambodia in 2017. Our results show that tractor or truck-hire cost was positively significant, and the cassava uprooting machine-hire cost was negatively significant. The average technical efficiency score of 0.62 indicates that cassava producers can increase their level of technical efficiency. Although cassava production in Cambodia is mechanized and investors are investing, it would be more beneficial to producers if they were provided with financial assistance when uprooting the cassava at the harvest time. Appropriate control of input costs can effectively improve cassava yield, following the implementation of the National Policy on Cassava 2020–2025 by the Royal Government of Cambodia.","Phalaenopsis orchids are an increasingly popular potted house plant in the United States. New cultivars have a long display life in home environments, but these epiphytes are often overirrigated by consumers. Irrigating potted Phalaenopsis orchids weekly with ice cubes has been recommended as a simple solution to help consumers, but concern has been raised about whether the ice cubes will cause low temperature damage in these tropical plants. The effect of ice cube irrigation on the display life and quality of four cultivars of potted Phalaenopsis orchids was, therefore, evaluated. Irrigation treatments includedweekly application of three ice cubes or the equivalent volume of room-temperature tap water. The longevity of individual flowers and the overall display life of the orchid plants were determined. Monthly measurements determined the volume of leachate in the outer decorative pots after irrigation. The quantum yield of photosystem II (FPSII) in roots and leaves was evaluatedmonthly to determine if photosynthetic efficiencywas affected by the ice irrigation. The temperature in the orchid bark growing media during irrigation events was recorded, and a programmable antifreeze bath was used to determine the temperature at which damage to PSII was observed in orchid roots. The flower longevity and display life were unaffected by irrigation treatment. In general, the leachate volume over time was the same or lower in ice irrigated orchids comparedwith those irrigatedwith the same volume of water. The lowest temperature in the barkmedia irrigated with ice cubes was’11 8C, while controlled freezing experiments showed that damage to photosystem II in orchid roots did not occur until bath temperatures were belowL7 8C. The internal temperature of roots in direct contactwith ice cubes decreased to around 4 8C. Ice cube irrigation had no detrimental effects on the quality or display life of potted Phalaenopsis orchids growing in bark, demonstrating that ice cubes are a viable method of irrigating these tropical house plants. Orchids are currently the top-selling potted flowering plant in the United States because of their long flower life and compact growth (Banks, 2005; Fitch, 2004; USDA, 2016). While the popularity of many potted plants is declining, the number of orchids that are sold each year is increasing. Most commercial orchid sales are Phalaenopsis sp., also called moth orchids (Griesbach, 2002). The USDA Floriculture Crops Summary reported the wholesale value of potted orchids (including Phalaenopsis) to be $288 million in 2015, an increase of $15 million over the 2014 value (USDA, 2016). The introduction of improved hybrids and the development of large-scale production protocols that reduce the time required to produce flowering plants have allowed potted orchids to be grown for mass-market consumers (Griesbach, 2002). Phalaenopsis species, which originate from tropical and subtropical climates, have a long flower display life in the typical temperatures and low light levels of a home (Banks, 2005). These orchids are epiphytic in their native environments and grow on trees with their roots exposed to the air (Banks, 2005). The roots of Phalaenopsis orchids contain chlorophyll and are photosynthetic (Dycus and Knudson, 1957; Lopez and Runkle, 2005). Commercial production of Phalaenopsis is usually in a bark-based potting media that allows for good aeration and drainage (Griesbach, 2002). In the home environment, proper irrigation is the largest challenge to maintaining a healthy potted orchid. Underwatering the plant will result in wrinkled, flaccid leaves, whereas overwatering or letting the orchid sit in water can result in damaged roots (Cullina, 2004). Healthy roots of Phalaenopsis are vivid green when the plant is well-watered, and they have a silvery hue when dry. Unhealthy roots are tan or brown (Cullina, 2004). The technique of irrigating Phalaenopsis orchids with ice cubes has been recommended to orchid owners to reduce the likelihood of overor underwatering the plants (Onofrey, 2009). Ice cubes provide a convenient way to apply a set volume of water, which is released slowly as the ice melts. The idea is that the ice melt will move slowly through the porous bark media, allowing more water to be absorbed by the bark and roots and resulting in less water accumulation in the bottom of pots where it may cause root damage. Concerns about this technique include whether the melting ice will provide enough water for proper plant growth and whether the ice will cause low temperature damage or reduce the display life of the plants (Cullina, 2004). Even brief exposure to low temperatures can cause chilling injury (CI) in tropical species (Wang, 2007). Mesophyll cell collapse is a physiological disorder that can occur in orchid leaves exposed to low air or water temperatures (Cating and Palmateer, 2009; Sheehan, 2002). Symptoms include the development of sunken, light-green to yellow areas on the upper surfaces of the leaves, which then turn brown and necrotic. The severity of the CI is dependent on the temperature, duration of exposure, and physiological age of the leaves (McConnell and Sheehan, 1978). Exposure to 2 C for 8 h causes mesophyll cell collapse in Phalaenopsis leaves. Water soaked spots on the upper surface of the leaves can be observed 0.5 h after removal from the chilling temperature treatment and these progress to deeply sunken dark brown spots within 3 weeks (McConnell and Sheehan, 1978). While CI can be induced in the leaves of some Phalaenopsis species at temperatures below 10 C, there is no information about root damage or what temperatures the roots experience when plants are irrigated with ice cubes. The objectives of this research were to 1) evaluate the effect of ice cube irrigation on the flower longevity, display life, and quality of potted Phalaenopsis orchids growing in bark; 2) measure the temperature of the bark Received for publication 13 June 2017.

The lives of many Kansans revolve around the life cycle of wheat. Producers plant the crop when conditions are favorable in autumn; anxiously hope that the plants will survive cold, drought, and wind during winter and spring; and then suspend most other farming operations and social activities to harvest the grain in early summer. Equipment and fertilizer dealers extend their hours of operation to provide supplies that producers need during critical periods. Elevator operators add help and stay open late to take in the grain during harvest, and railroads and truckers add equipment to move it to market.

Agricultural mechanization promotes productivity, but overinvestment may disrupt the balance between inputs and outputs. Depending on the production scale, sometimes hiring equipment is considered better than purchasing it. While we can hypothesize that mechanization and investments might be crucial factors of productivity, technical efficiency analysis for estimating their effects has not yet been conducted. Therefore, this study investigates the impact of mechanization and investments on cassava yield and producers’ technical efficiency in Cambodia using the Cobb-Douglas stochastic frontier production model. For the study, 205 respondents were randomly selected and interviewed in the Battambang and Pailin provinces in northwestern Cambodia in 2017. Our results show that tractor or truck-hire cost was positively significant, and the cassava uprooting machine-hire cost was negatively significant. The average technical efficiency score of 0.62 indicates that cassava producers can increase their level of technical efficiency. Although cassava production in Cambodia is mechanized and investors are investing, it would be more beneficial to producers if they were provided with financial assistance when uprooting the cassava at the harvest time. Appropriate control of input costs can effectively improve cassava yield, following the implementation of the National Policy on Cassava 2020–2025 by the Royal Government of Cambodia.","Mopani District Municipality in the northeast of South Africa is largely semi-arid and frequently affected by meteorological droughts. The recent 2015/16 event had devastating impacts on water levels, crop yields, livestock herds and rural livelihoods. We investigated the nature of the drought hazard; its impacts, including vulnerability of rural communities in Mopani District and adaptation strategies they have employed to cope with drought. A mixed methods approach with both quantitative and qualitative datasets was used. The district was divided into two distinct climatic areas: the drier eastern lowveld and the wetter western bushveld. Questionnaires were administered among community members whilst key informant interviews were conducted among relevant government and municipal officials. Climate data was used to characterize historical drought using a Standardized Precipitation and Evapotranspiration Index whilst vegetation anomaly maps were used to demonstrate impacts. Spatially distinct patterns of drought conditions were evident with harsh and dry conditions towards the east. It was found that nearly half the time there is some form of drought or another in the district mostly linked to the remote El Nino phenomenon. In several areas, rain-fed agriculture is no longer tenable, with a direct impact on rural livelihoods. A Household Vulnerability Index determined variable levels of vulnerability such that different strategies are employed to adapt to drought some of which cause environmental problems. Local government intervention strategies include supply of seeds and fertilisers, providing cheap fodder and supplying water using trucks. The findings of this study contribute to disaster risk reduction efforts in a region that is highly vulnerable to current and future climate-risks.","Phalaenopsis orchids are an increasingly popular potted house plant in the United States. New cultivars have a long display life in home environments, but these epiphytes are often overirrigated by consumers. Irrigating potted Phalaenopsis orchids weekly with ice cubes has been recommended as a simple solution to help consumers, but concern has been raised about whether the ice cubes will cause low temperature damage in these tropical plants. The effect of ice cube irrigation on the display life and quality of four cultivars of potted Phalaenopsis orchids was, therefore, evaluated. Irrigation treatments includedweekly application of three ice cubes or the equivalent volume of room-temperature tap water. The longevity of individual flowers and the overall display life of the orchid plants were determined. Monthly measurements determined the volume of leachate in the outer decorative pots after irrigation. The quantum yield of photosystem II (FPSII) in roots and leaves was evaluatedmonthly to determine if photosynthetic efficiencywas affected by the ice irrigation. The temperature in the orchid bark growing media during irrigation events was recorded, and a programmable antifreeze bath was used to determine the temperature at which damage to PSII was observed in orchid roots. The flower longevity and display life were unaffected by irrigation treatment. In general, the leachate volume over time was the same or lower in ice irrigated orchids comparedwith those irrigatedwith the same volume of water. The lowest temperature in the barkmedia irrigated with ice cubes was’11 8C, while controlled freezing experiments showed that damage to photosystem II in orchid roots did not occur until bath temperatures were belowL7 8C. The internal temperature of roots in direct contactwith ice cubes decreased to around 4 8C. Ice cube irrigation had no detrimental effects on the quality or display life of potted Phalaenopsis orchids growing in bark, demonstrating that ice cubes are a viable method of irrigating these tropical house plants. Orchids are currently the top-selling potted flowering plant in the United States because of their long flower life and compact growth (Banks, 2005; Fitch, 2004; USDA, 2016). While the popularity of many potted plants is declining, the number of orchids that are sold each year is increasing. Most commercial orchid sales are Phalaenopsis sp., also called moth orchids (Griesbach, 2002). The USDA Floriculture Crops Summary reported the wholesale value of potted orchids (including Phalaenopsis) to be $288 million in 2015, an increase of $15 million over the 2014 value (USDA, 2016). The introduction of improved hybrids and the development of large-scale production protocols that reduce the time required to produce flowering plants have allowed potted orchids to be grown for mass-market consumers (Griesbach, 2002). Phalaenopsis species, which originate from tropical and subtropical climates, have a long flower display life in the typical temperatures and low light levels of a home (Banks, 2005). These orchids are epiphytic in their native environments and grow on trees with their roots exposed to the air (Banks, 2005). The roots of Phalaenopsis orchids contain chlorophyll and are photosynthetic (Dycus and Knudson, 1957; Lopez and Runkle, 2005). Commercial production of Phalaenopsis is usually in a bark-based potting media that allows for good aeration and drainage (Griesbach, 2002). In the home environment, proper irrigation is the largest challenge to maintaining a healthy potted orchid. Underwatering the plant will result in wrinkled, flaccid leaves, whereas overwatering or letting the orchid sit in water can result in damaged roots (Cullina, 2004). Healthy roots of Phalaenopsis are vivid green when the plant is well-watered, and they have a silvery hue when dry. Unhealthy roots are tan or brown (Cullina, 2004). The technique of irrigating Phalaenopsis orchids with ice cubes has been recommended to orchid owners to reduce the likelihood of overor underwatering the plants (Onofrey, 2009). Ice cubes provide a convenient way to apply a set volume of water, which is released slowly as the ice melts. The idea is that the ice melt will move slowly through the porous bark media, allowing more water to be absorbed by the bark and roots and resulting in less water accumulation in the bottom of pots where it may cause root damage. Concerns about this technique include whether the melting ice will provide enough water for proper plant growth and whether the ice will cause low temperature damage or reduce the display life of the plants (Cullina, 2004). Even brief exposure to low temperatures can cause chilling injury (CI) in tropical species (Wang, 2007). Mesophyll cell collapse is a physiological disorder that can occur in orchid leaves exposed to low air or water temperatures (Cating and Palmateer, 2009; Sheehan, 2002). Symptoms include the development of sunken, light-green to yellow areas on the upper surfaces of the leaves, which then turn brown and necrotic. The severity of the CI is dependent on the temperature, duration of exposure, and physiological age of the leaves (McConnell and Sheehan, 1978). Exposure to 2 C for 8 h causes mesophyll cell collapse in Phalaenopsis leaves. Water soaked spots on the upper surface of the leaves can be observed 0.5 h after removal from the chilling temperature treatment and these progress to deeply sunken dark brown spots within 3 weeks (McConnell and Sheehan, 1978). While CI can be induced in the leaves of some Phalaenopsis species at temperatures below 10 C, there is no information about root damage or what temperatures the roots experience when plants are irrigated with ice cubes. The objectives of this research were to 1) evaluate the effect of ice cube irrigation on the flower longevity, display life, and quality of potted Phalaenopsis orchids growing in bark; 2) measure the temperature of the bark Received for publication 13 June 2017.

Materials and Methods Plant material. Potted orchids (Phalaenopsis sp.) were received on 21 Jan. 2016 at the Ohio Agricultural Research and Development Center in Wooster, OH, and on 22 Jan. 2016 at the University of Georgia, Athens, GA. The orchids were transported on a temperature-controlled truck from Green Circle Growers (Oberlin, OH). Plants were growing in a custom bark media (95% bark and 5% sphagnum peatmoss; Oldcastle Lawn and Garden, Columbus, OH) in round, 11.5-cm plastic pots (700 mL volume) inside decorative ceramic pots. The orchids were at a market-ready stage with two flower spikes per plant and three to five open flowers on each spike. Four popular commercial cultivars, 699, 322, 386, and 56-100975, were used in all experiments except where noted. Expt. 1. Evaluating the effects of ice cube irrigation on the quality and display life of potted Phalaenopsis orchids Experimental set up and environmental conditions. Experiments were conducted at two locations (Wooster, OH and Athens, GA) in an interior evaluation room set up to simulate an office or home environment. These locations are referred to as OH and GA, respectively. All windows in the rooms were blocked, and light was provided by fluorescent lights from 8:00 AM to 5:00 PM daily. The average photosynthetic photon flux (PPF) in the room at plant height in OH was 7.8 mmol·m·s, and the range was from 3.0 to 12.5 mmol·m·s across the room (LI-190R Quantum; LI-COR BioSciences, Lincoln, NE). In GA, the PPF was 6.8 mmol·m·s, and the range was 3.7 to 10.0 mmol·m·s across the room (LI-190SA; LICOR BioSciences). The plants were blocked to account for the varying PPF. The temperature set point in each room was 21 C. In OH, a relative humidity around 40% was maintained using a humidifier (Space Saver Evaporative Humidifier Model 831000; Aircare, Little Rock, AZ). The mean relative humidity in GA was 49% ± 9%. The mean room temperature over the entire experiment was 21.2 Cwith a range of 14.5 to 28.7 C in OH (January to July), and a mean of 22.0 C and a range of 14.0 to 26.9 C in GA (January to May). Temperature and humidity were monitored using a Watchdog (Model 2475 Plant Growth Station; Spectrum Technologies Inc., Plainfield, IL) or a temperature/ humidity data logger (Hobo U12; Onset Computers, Bourne, MA). Fans were used to increase air circulation, and in OH, air samples were collected monthly to measure ethylene levels in the evaluation room using a gas chromatograph (Varian 3800; Agilent, Foster City, CA). Ethylene was not detected during the experiment. Treatments. Orchids were arranged on tables in a split-plot randomized complete block design that accounted for the gradient in PPF. The main-plot effects were irrigation treatment (ice vs. water) arranged in six complete blocks (replicates). The subplot effects were cultivar (699, 322, 386, and 56-100975) arranged randomly within e","The role of agricultural machinery interacting with the main soil is performed by its wheels, which either amplify or mitigate adverse effects.
