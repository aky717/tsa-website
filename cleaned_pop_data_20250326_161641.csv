Since 2001, the Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWS NET) has been monitoring crop performance and relative production using satellite-derived data and simulation models in Africa, Central America, and Afghanistan where ground-based monitoring is limited because of a scarcity of weather stations. The commonly used crop monitoring models are based on a crop water-balance algorithm with inputs from satellite-derived rainfall estimates. These models are useful to monitor rainfed agriculture, but they are ineffective for irrigated areas. This study focused on Afghanistan, where over 80 percent of agricultural production comes from irrigated lands. We developed and implemented a Simplified Surface Energy Balance (SSEB) model to monitor and assess the performance of irrigated agriculture in Afghanistan using a combination of 1-km thermal data and 250-m Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data, both from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor. We estimated seasonal actual evapotranspiration (ETa) over a period of six years (2000-2005) for two major irrigated river basins in Afghanistan, the Kabul and the Helmand, by analyzing up to 19 cloud-free thermal and NDVI images from each year. These seasonal ETa estimates were used as relative indicators of year-to-year production magnitude differences. The temporal water-use pattern of the two irrigated basins was indicative of the cropping patterns specific to each region. Our results were comparable to field reports and to estimates based on watershed-wide crop water-balance model results. For example, both methods found that the 2003 seasonal ETa was the highest of all six years. The method also captured water management scenarios where a unique year-to-year variability was identified in addition to water-use differences between upstream and downstream basins. A major advantage of the energy-balance approach is that it can be used to quantify spatial extent of irrigated fields and their water-use dynamics without reference to source of water as opposed to a water-balance model which requires knowledge of both the magnitude and temporal distribution of rainfall and irrigation applied to fields.",https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/7/6/979/pdf?version=1403303876,

Droughts continue to affect ecosystems, communities and entire economies. Agriculture bears much of the impact, and in many countries it is the most heavily affected sector. Over the past decades, efforts have been made to assess drought risk at different spatial scales. Here, we present for the first time an integrated assessment of drought risk for both irrigated and rainfed agricultural systems at the global scale. Composite hazard indicators were calculated for irrigated and rainfed systems separately using different drought indices based on historical climate conditions (1980–2016). Exposure was analyzed for irrigated and non-irrigated crops. Vulnerability was assessed through a socioecological-system (SES) perspective, using socioecological susceptibility and lack of coping-capacity indicators that were weighted by drought experts from around the world. The analysis shows that drought risk of rainfed and irrigated agricultural systems displays a heterogeneous pattern at the global level, with higher risk for southeastern Europe as well as northern and southern Africa. By providing information on the drivers and spatial patterns of drought risk in all dimensions of hazard, exposure and vulnerability, the presented analysis can support the identification of tailored measures to reduce drought risk and increase the resilience of agricultural systems.",https://nhess.copernicus.org/articles/20/695/2020/nhess-20-695-2020.pdf,

However, in Sub-Saharan Africa, the situation is inverted. Statistics show that food insecurity has risen since 2015 in Sub-Saharan African countries, and the situation has worsened owing to the Ukraine conflict and the ongoing implications of the COVID-19 threat. This review looks into multidimensional challenges to achieving the SDG2 goal of “End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture” in Sub-Saharan Africa and the prosper policy recommendations for action. Findings indicate that weak economic growth, gender inequality, high inflation, low crop productivity, low investment in irrigated agriculture and research, climate change, high population growth, poor policy frameworks, weak infrastructural development, and corruption are the major hurdles in the sustaining food security in Sub-Saharan Africa. Promoting investments in agricultural infrastructure and extension services together with implementing policies targeted at enhancing the households’ purchasing power, especially those in rural regions, appear to be essential drivers for improving both food availability and food access.",https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/19/22/14836/pdf?version=1669097196,

On a global scale, agriculture represents 70% of blue water use. • One main difference among all methods for assessing water use is whether and how they include green and gray water. The “water footprint” approach includes green water, whereas life cycle assessment approaches tend to exclude green water or to include only the variation in green water resulting from changes in land use. A second difference is whether water use is reported as a volume of water or as an index of water-use impact (e.g., H2O equivalents). A third is whether water that returns to the same location (e.g., in urine) is considered to have been consumed. • Because of these differences and the fact that existing studies have analyzed only a limited number of different livestock production systems, methods give wildly different results for the same livestock product. For example, estimations of water use to produce 1 kg of beef range from 3 to 540 L of H2O or H2O equivalents for the life cycle assessment approach and from 10,000 to 200,000 L of H2O for the water footprint. • Ultimately, water scarcity depends on blue water use. Decreasing the contribution of livestock to water scarcity can be achieved by decreasing feed irrigation. Livestock farming also has positive impacts on the environment related to water use. supplies in a region fall below 1,000 m3/person, which currently occurs throughout most countries in Northern Africa and the Arabian Peninsula (United Nations Environment Programme, 2008). Although such arid and semiarid regions are the most vulnerable to water scarcity, the demand side of the equation can have a strong, if not stronger, infl uence. Indeed, water stress, defi ned as annual water withdrawals exceeding 20% of the annual renewable water supply, has occurred in temperate-climate countries such as Belgium, Korea, and the United Kingdom (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, 2004). Thus, a defi nition of water scarcity that emphasizes the important role of water demand is, “the point at which the aggregate impact of all users impinges on the supply or quality of water . . . to the extent that the demand by all sectors, including the environment, cannot be satisfi ed fully” (UN-Water/FAO, 2007). Even if water demand does not lead to water scarcity (e.g., in wet regions), it can increase groundwater depth, potentially decreasing water fl ow to rivers and causing ecosystem changes. Global water demand is expected to increase greatly in the future, by 50% between 1995 and 2025 (United Nations Environment Programme, 2008), especially in developing countries, not only because of larger human populations, but also because of overall increases in industrial production and human affl uence, which lead to greater consumption of energy, consumer goods, and food, especially animal products. This increase in domestic, industrial, and agricultural water use is expected to expand the areas affected by water scarcity (Figure 1). This may happen even in regions with high rainfall, where population density and economic activity are high. Areas suffering from water scarcity may change from year to year. It has been estimated that 64% of the world population will live in water-deprived zones in 2025 (Rosegrant et al., 2002). For the remaining 36%, especially those living in temperate zones, livestock farming could be performed without strong water restrictions. For example, grassland irrigation, a common practice in “wet” countries such as New Zealand and the Netherlands, can be a useful strategy for increasing grass production. The supply side of freshwater is a function not only of regional rainfall, which can vary greatly within and between years, but also water management and distribution systems and water pollution, which renders freshwater nonpotable. Unfortunately, global climate change is modifying the supply side of the equation (rainfall patterns), and not in a uniform manner. Simulations of global climate change by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) with 21 different models predicted an average increase of at least 14% in annual rainfall in polar regions (above 60°N) and northern Asia; in contrast, they predicted at least a 12% decrease in annual rainfall in southern Europe and the Mediterranean Basin. Seasonal changes in rainfall are predicted to be even greater, with the greatest increases in December to February in the Tibetan Plateau",https://academic.oup.com/af/article-pdf/2/2/9/32409582/9.pdf,

Promoting better root growth and enhancing the soil’s fertility with organic materials are being found effective means for raising the yields of many crop plants with less water, less fertilizer, reduced seeds, fewer agrochemicals, and greater climate resilience. In this article, we review what is becoming known about various farmer-centred innovations for agroecological crop management that can contribute to agricultural sustainability. These changes represent the emerging system of crop intensification, which is being increasingly applied in Asian, African, and Latin American countries. More research will be needed to verify the efficacy and impact of these innovations and to clarify their conditions and limits.

Water infrastructure investment planning must consider the interdependencies within the water–energy–food nexus. Moreover, uncertain future climate, evolving socio-economic context, and stakeholders with conflicting interests, lead to a highly complex decision problem. Therefore, there is a need for decision support tools to objectively determine the value of investments, considering the impacts on different groups of actors, and the risks linked to uncertainties. We present a new open-source hydro-economic optimization model, incorporating in a holistic framework, representations of the water, agriculture, and power systems. The model represents the joint development of nexus-related infrastructure and policies and evaluates their economic impact, as well as the risks linked to uncertainties in future climate and socio-economic development. We apply the methodology in the Zambezi River basin, a major African basin shared by eight countries, in which multiple investment opportunities exist, including new hydropower plants, new or resized reservoirs, development of irrigation agriculture, and investments into the power grid. We show that it is crucial to consider the links between the different systems when evaluating the impacts of climate change and socio-economic development, which will ultimately influence investment decisions. We find that climate change could induce economic losses of up to USD 2.3 billion per year in the current system. We show that the value of the hydropower development plan is sensitive to future fuel prices, carbon pricing policies, the capital cost of solar technologies, and climate change. Similarly, we show that the value of the irrigation development plan is sensitive to the evolution of crop yields, world market crop prices, and climate change. Finally, we evaluate the opportunity costs of restoring the natural floods in the Zambezi Delta; we find limited economic trade-offs under the current climate, but major trade-offs with irrigation and hydropower generation under the driest climate change scenario.",https://hess.copernicus.org/articles/23/4129/2019/hess-23-4129-2019.pdf,

The Middle Drâa valley in Morocco is one of many semi-arid to arid mountainous areas struggling with increasing water scarcity threatening self-sufficient husbandry. In order to maintain people’s livelihoods water management needs to be adapted.

This paper presents the application of WEAP on the Middle Draâ valley’s water demand and supply, including several socioeconomic and land use scenarios under one basic climate change scenario. The climate scenario shows a significant decrease in available water resources up to 2029 while all socioeconomic scenarios show an increase in water demand. In years of droughts groundwater is used for irrigation, leading to increasingly depleted aquifers. The aquifers are recharged by percolation losses from irrigation and by river bed infiltration the latter of which is stronger in the northern oases than in the southern oases due to water withdrawal rules.

The objective of this research was to reduce environmental pollution by increasing nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) in vegetables without negatively affecting fruit yield or quality. Bell pepper was used as a case study for intensive vegetable cropping. Pepper cultivars with different vegetative vigor were drip-irrigated with solutions containing 9.2, 56.2, 102.3, and 158.5 mg·L nitrogen (N). Fruit yield, quality, and nutritional value were measured. Nitrogen balance was determined by quantifying N in soil and in plant tissues. Maximum yields were found when peppers were irrigated with 56.2 mg·L N. Nitrogen concentrations of 102.3 and 158.5 mg·L N loaded 400 and 800 kg·ha N into the environment, respectively, whereas for the 56.2 mg·L N concentration, N was almost completely taken up and used by the plants. Nitrogen treatments had no significant negative effect on pepper fruit physical or chemical quality parameters including sugar content and acidity. Reduced N application did not affect nutritional quality components of the pepper fruit such as b-carotene and lycopene content or total antioxidant activity. The vigorous cultivar used N more efficiently. The results demonstrate how the environmental impact of intensive agriculture can be minimized without harming fruit yield or quality by reducing N application level and adopting cultivars with improved N use efficiency. As a result of a rising demand for yearlong supply of fresh produce and the necessity of plant protection, the use of protective housing (insect-proof net houses and greenhouses) for cropping systems has gained global importance. Protected cultivation is particularly important for the production of fresh vegetables (Gruda, 2005). Improvements in agricultural practices in the past mainly focused on productivity; today, objectives including crop product quality, production cost, and environmental impact have become fundamental. N, the most important and widely applied agricultural nutrient, is also a major potential environmental contaminant and, hence, increasing NUE is central to environmental responsibility and agricultural sustainability (Fageria and Baligar, 2005; Gastal and Lemaire, 2002; MascleauxDaubresse et al., 2010). Improved N management has become essential in recent years because of increased levels of nitrate (NO3N) in groundwater associated with high rates of N fertilizer application to crops (Del Amor, 2007). Sufficient N is essential for normal plant growth and development, being an integral part of protein and chloroplast structure and function (Barker and Bryson, 2007). Nitrogen deficiency has been studied on the majority of horticultural crops, whereas the effects of oversupply of N are not as widely understood (Stefanelli et al., 2010). In vegetable crops, excessive N often leads to increased vegetative growth at the expense of root or fruit development (Elia and Conversa, 2012; Mengel et al., 2001; Ruiz and Romero, 1998). In greenhouse tomatoes, high N can lead to poor fruit set, to reduced sugars, and to consequential inferior taste (Stefanelli et al., 2010). The low cost of N fertilizers and the dramatic effect of N application on yields of intensive vegetable crops have led to overuse of fertilizers by farmers (Glass, 2003). For this reason, in many agricultural systems, a considerable proportion of applied N fertilizer is lost from the root zone to subsoil, groundwater, rivers, and oceans (Glass, 2003). Leaching of NO3-N occurs in many vegetable production areas where N application rates exceed crop demand (Zhu et al., 2005). Pepper (Capsicum annum L.) production is becoming commercially important in various regions of the world including Israel, Spain, southern Europe, and north Africa where the crop is grown from fall to spring in greenhouses and net houses. Such production in protective structures commonly yields more than 100 t·ha of high-quality fruit seasonally. Nitrogen application response studies have previously been conducted on bell pepper. Seasonal N application of 135 to 252 kg·ha to open-field peppers was found to increase flower number and fruit yield (Hartz et al., 1993). This N application rate resulted in yields of 50 t·ha. Intensified models for pepper production commonly practice much higher application rates of nutrients including N than in the traditional open-field production systems. Nitrogen in these cases is applied continuously through drip irrigation systems (fertigation) at rates reaching 100 to 150 mg·L N and with seasonal application reaching 750 to 900 kg·ha N (Bar-Tal et al., 2001; Jovicich et al., 2004; Schon et al., 1994). Crop response to applied N and NUE are important criteria for evaluating N requirements for maximum economic yield (Fageria and Baligar, 2005). Recovery of applied N in crop plants is usually less than 50% (Fageria and Baligar, 2005; Glass, 2003). Hence, improving NUE is desirable to improve crop yields, reduce production costs, and maintain environmental quality (Fageria and Baligar, 2005). Use of plant species or genotypes efficient in absorption and use of N can facilitate N productivity and sustainable agricultural systems (Fageria and Baligar, 2005; Stefanelli et al., 2010). Genetic variability in NUE has been recognized for many years (Smith, 1934). In tomato, genotype variation was found to influence N use and assimilation (Ruiz and Romero, 1998). High NUE genotypes were characterized with higher accumulation of NO3-N in the leaves, high nitrate reductase activities, and high protein and organic N contents (Ruiz and Romero, 1998). Differences in N uptake and use have also been found among other crop species and cultivars including wheat, sorghum, corn, ryegrass, and soybean (Fageria and Baligar, 2005). Global consumer interest regarding the quality of vegetable products has increased in recent years (Stefanelli et al., 2010).

The need to do away with fossil fuel in powering irrigation systems cannot be over emphasized due to climate change. Smart Irrigation systems powered by renewable energy sources (RES) have been proven to substantially improve crop yield and the profitability of agriculture. Here we show how the control and monitoring of a solar powered smart irrigation system can be achieved using sensors and environmental data from an Internet of Everything (IoE).

Various agronomic measures have been proposed for lifting agricultural production in Africa and to adapt it to climate change. Here, we present a projection of potential climate change impacts on maize yields under different intensification options in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) using an agronomic model, GIS-based EPIC (GEPIC). Fallow and nutrient management options taken into account are (a) conventional intensification with high mineral N supply and a bare fallow, (b) moderate mineral N supply and cowpea rotation, and (c) moderate mineral N supply and rotation with a fast growing N fixing tree Sesbania sesban. The simulations suggest that until the 2040s rotation with Sesbania will lead to an increase in yields due to increasing N supply besides improving water infiltration and soils’ water holding capacity. Intensive cultivation with a bare fallow or an herbaceous crop like cowpea in the rotation is predicted to result in lower yields and increased soil erosion during the same time span. However, yields are projected to decrease in all management scenarios towards the end of the century, should temperature increase beyond critical thresholds. The results suggest that the effect of eco-intensification as a sole means of adapting agriculture to climate change is limited in Sub-Saharan Africa. Highly adverse temperatures would rather have to be faced by improved heat tolerant cultivars, while strongly adverse decreases in precipitation would have to be faced by expanding irrigation where feasible. While the evaluation of changes in agro-environmental variables like soil organic carbon, erosion, and soil humidity hints that these are major factors influencing climate change resilience of the field crop, no direct relationship between these factors, crop yields, and changes in climate variables could be identified. This will need further detailed studies at the field and regional scale.",https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/9/4/044004/pdf,

Coffee cultivars are planted in a very wide range of ecological and social conditions and may be grown using few culture practices where almost no changes occur to the natural environment or by means of mechanization, irrigation, fertilization and pest control with chemical insecticides which often leads to a complete destruction of the surrounding vegetation and changes in the ecosystem. Small farmers are the predominant coffee growers in all countries and technology in most cases is not readily available to them. This coffee world situation results in a great variety of sanitary problems, which varies according to the country even in similar ecological regions. All agricultural production systems have to deal with plant protection problems and coffee is no exception. Since the early 20th century, coffee production suffers from numerous insect pests, being the coffee berry borer, the white stem borer, leaf miners and mealybugs, the most serious examples since they can cause coffee farmers to lose up to 20% of a crop and reduce the coffee value by 30 to 40%. These coffee pests could be kept below economic threshold levels by adopting integrated management strategies such as anticipation and continuous monitoring of pest outbreaks, maintenance of optimum shade, pruning of coffee bushes, good harvesting and processing of the berries, conservation and augmentation of indigenous natural enemies, introduction of exotic natural enemies and timely use of need based chemical or bio insecticides.

Agriculture has to respond to this increased food demand by producing more from shrinking land and water resources (Pimentel et al., 1997). The climate change process has caused unpredictable and uneven rainfall patterns, resulting in more competition for water resources for crop cultivation and other socioeconomic uses (Hossain, 1995; Alcamo et al., 1999). Rice is one of the major staple food crops for more than a third of the world’s population (David, 1991). It is mostly grown in well-puddled and irrigated conditions, and requires two to three times more water than other food crops such as wheat or maize. In total, rice production in the world uses about 1,600 km3 of water, which accounts for 30% of the fresh water used worldwide (Gleick, 1993). There is an urgent need to increase rice production to meet global demand. It is estimated that the world needs to produce 40% more rice to feed the population by 2025 (FAO , 2002). With the grain yield in irrigated areas reaching stagnation, a large portion of the predicted increase has to come from the water-short drought-prone rainfed lowland and upland rice areas. Rainfed lowland and upland areas occupy about 38% of the total cropped rice area but contribute only 21% to total rice production (Khush, 1997). The lower contribution of the water-short drought-prone rainfed areas to total rice production is due to the lower per unit productivity primarily caused by the frequent occurrence of drought due to a failure of rain or a long spell between two rains. Drought has been identified as the key factor for low productivity in the rainfed ecosystem (Zeigler & Puckridge, 1995). Drought is particularly more frequent in South and Southeast Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, and the ongoing climatic change process is likely to further worsen the scenario in these rice-growing areas. In Asia alone, about 34 million ha of rainfed lowland and 8 million ha of rainfed upland rice experience drought stress of varying intensities at different stages of the crop almost every year (Wopereis et al., 1996; Huke & Huke, 1997). Most of the rice varieties presently cultivated in rainfed areas were developed for irrigated conditions. These varieties are highly popular among farmers because of their high yield potential and good grain quality but are highly susceptible to drought, causing substantial yield losses during years of drought. Breeding rice varieties with increased yield under drought is an important research area to achieve sustainable rice production under water-",https://www.intechopen.com/citation-pdf-url/34111,

Field experiments were carried out as split plot based on randomized complete block design with three replications. Three irrigation levels, I1 = 100% (control), I2 = 75%, and I3 = 50% of the field capacity (FC), were determined at the 0–15 cm soil depth by time-domain reflectometry (TDR), as main plots and three levels of bacterial species consisting of no bacterial inoculation (control), Bacillus megaterium TV 6D (B1), Bacillus subtilis TV 12H (B2) as sub plots in 2012 and 2013. Physiological characteristics, plant growth, yield, and plant nutrient content of lettuce was significantly affected by PGPR and irrigation quantities. Results showed that decreasing irrigation quantities significantly decreased the growth, dry and fresh head weight, and yield of lettuce in both years. Moreover, lower irrigation levels caused a decrease in leaf relative water content (LRWC), stomatal conductance (SC), and plant nutrient element content, but an increase electrolyte leakage (EL) and lipid peroxidation [malondialdehyde (MDA)]. However, PGPR inoculations significantly increased the growth, nutrient element content, LRWC, SC, and yield but decreased EL andMDA of lettuce plants grown under lower irrigation levels. The results of the study suggested that PGPR inoculations could alleviate the deleterious effects of lower irrigation conditions on the growth and yield of lettuce plants. Water deficit is one of the main constraints affecting plant growth and crop yield in arid, semiarid, and even in humid areas, causing the fatal economic losses in agriculture (Marulanda et al., 2009; Sandhya et al., 2010). Drought has been reported to affect various aspects of human lives of one-third of the world’s population including human health and agricultural productivity. For example, according to an estimate by the United Nations, one-third of the world’s population lives in areas where water is scarce. Furthermore, climatic changes also enhanced the frequency and intensity of water shortage in subtropical areas of Asia and Africa (Athar and Ashraf, 2009). Water deficit results in limitation to the plant growth and yield in agricultural crops. The decline of plant growth caused by water insufficiency is considered to be one of the most important ecological factors limiting plant survival and establishment (Henry and Le Hou’erou, 1996). Plants are constantly exposed to a wide range of environmental stresses, which limit plant productivity. Over several centuries, breeding programs have focused on generating crop species with enhanced productivity under suboptimal environmental conditions (Saravanakumar et al., 2011). Drought resistance has been suggested as being a ‘‘complex trait,’’ especially with the recent expansion of research into its genomics (Blum, 2011). Breeding of new crop varieties, screening, and selection of the existing germplasm of potential crops for mitigating the deleterious effects of drought stress have been suggested as major strategies. However, extent and rate of progress in improving stress tolerance in crops through conventional breeding program is limited. This is due to complex mechanism of abiotic stress tolerance, which is controlled by the expression of several minor genes. Furthermore, techniques employed for selecting tolerant plants are time consuming and consequently expensive (Athar and Ashraf, 2009). Therefore, improving methods and strategies to cope with deleterious effects of drought stress has received considerable attention nowadays. Recently, an alternative strategy to mitigate the harmful effects of water deficit on crops using PGPR has been suggested (Forchetti et al., 2010). PGPR colonize the rhizosphere of plants and promote growth through various direct and indirect mechanisms (Glick, 1995). They have been suggested to ameliorate the growth of plants grown under environmental stress conditions, protecting plants from the deleterious effects of environmental stresses (Karlidag et al., 2011; Sandhya et al., 2010; Yildirim et al., 2006, 2008, 2011). The growthpromoting effect of PGPRmay bemediated by reduction of stress ethylene production via the action of 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC) deaminase (Mayak et al., 2004); the synthesis of phytohormones such as indole3-acetic acid (IAA), salicylic acid (SA), and gibberellin (GA) (Arkhipova et al., 2007; Forchetti et al., 2010; Turan et al., 2014); alleviation of the oxidative damage (Kohler et al., 2008); inducing changes in the expression of reactive oxygen species (ROS)–scavenging enzymes; and improved photosynthetic performance (Gururani et al., 2013). The term ‘‘induced systemic tolerance’’ has been proposed for PGPR-induced physical and chemical changes in plants that result in enhanced tolerance to abiotic stress (Yang et al., 2009). Furthermore, Pereyra et al. (2006) reported that PGPR inoculation could contribute to protect plants from HORTSCIENCE VOL. 50(9) SEPTEMBER 2015 1379 | SOIL MANAGEMENT, FERTILIZATION, AND IRRIGATION",https://journals.ashs.org/downloadpdf/journals/hortsci/50/9/article-p1379.pdf,

The world scenario on salinity problems is critical, over 20 percent of the cultivated area and half of the irrigated land in the world is encountering salinity stress of different magnitudes. The importance of date palm culture for its high nutritive, economic and social values is well recognized, especially in arid and semi-arid areas where it plays an important role influencing microclimate in a way that enhances the production of other agricultural crops. Worldwide production, utilization and industrialization of dates are increasing continuously (Botes and Zaid 2002). Different productivity parameters such as germination of seeds, seedling growth, vigor, reproductive flushing and fruiting are adversely affected reflecting on optimum production and productivity. The basic cause of salinity hazards is enhanced ion toxicity causing impaired sequestering of sodium ions into the vacuoles. The increased ionic concentration of the soil solution decreases the osmotic potential of the soil creating severe water stress derailing the uptake process. This can create imbalance in the absorption process of other minerals. In order to achieve salt-tolerance, the foremost task is either to prevent or alleviate the damage, or to re-establish homeostatic conditions in the new stressful environment (Parida and Das, 2005). The date palm growth and production in the arid regions is adversely affected by salinity problems apart from other crops like vegetables and fruits (Figures 1 & 2). Date palm is considered as the subsistence crop of the Middle East and North Africa. Despite date palms outstanding agronomic and socio-economic significance, attempts to use date palm biodiversity to screen against salinity tolerance have been limited and therefore of urgent priority. Although potential salt tolerant cultivars are available, there is no systematic approach to characterize such genotypes employing molecular diagnostic techniques. The understanding of the molecular, physiological, biochemical basis and soil factors will be helpful in developing selection strategies for improving salinity tolerance. Therefore pooling the information through the present review on salt responses in relation to various factors is crucial in developing strategies and improving salt tolerant mechanism in date palms. The review article covers the different aspects under the various growth stages of date palm, like seedling, vegetative phase and reproductive phase. The review also focuses on the use of remote sensing technology in date palm responses to salinity.",https://doi.org/10.5772/29527,

Tomato, one of the most important vegetables in the world, is grown mostly outdoors, and may be severely impacted by CC. Farmers cultivating tomatoes need to adapt to an increase in the potential for outbreaks of pests favoured by CC and disruption of biological control, yet, no attempt has been made to simultaneously evaluate CC effects on a crop-pest-natural enemy system for tomato or any other crop. Here, we modelled the suitability of areas equipped with irrigation facilities (AEI) in 2050 for tomato, the two-spotted spider mite, Tetranychus urticae, a mite pest of tomato among more than 200 crops, and its key predator Phytoseiulus persimilis. We evaluated the suitability of AEI for tomato production under a 1.6 °C warming by 2050, within the targets of the Paris agreement. Projections show that climatic conditions become unsuitable for tomato production on 30%–100% of AEI for seven out of the 29 top tomato producing countries of the world. Model predictions suggest that two-spotted spider mite potential for outbreaks would increase substantially in nine countries in Europe, Africa and Asia, while biological control failures would occur globally. Model results have a significant relationship with growth rates for the three species measured in outdoor experiments, and farmer/expert perceptions on two-spotted spider mite outbreak severity captured via interviews. The expansion of AEI in other agricultural areas in the sub-Saharan Africa may offset losses of suitable land.

The WSIAW measures the degree to which both green and blue water availabilities can satisfy the agricultural water requirement. The WSIAW can directly indicate water scarcity in both rainfed and irrigated areas, which cannot be captured by the blue water scarcity index alone. Using the WSIAW, we assessed the evolution of water scarcity across regions of the world during 1971–2010 at a spatial resolution of 0.5 arc degree. We found that 22% of the 228 river basins with a WSIAW of >1 presented a much broader geographical coverage compared with estimates of water scarcity based on blue water only (8% of total basins). The WSIAW also exhibited a clear trend of increasing severity over the study period, particularly in major agricultural regions. Expanding cropland and increasing/competing water withdrawals by other sectors were the main reasons for the intensification of water scarcity, which was pronounced in some Asian and African river basins.

It was introduced in Brazil during the colonization period, and today represents one of the main cultures of the economy. Brazil is currently the world’s largest sugarcane producer. The 08/09 crop yielded approximately 569 millions of tons, totaling 27.5 million liters of ethanol and 31.0 million tons of sugar (ÚNICA, 2011). This makes Brazil responsible for providing 25% of the sugar consumed all over the globe (ÚNICA, 2011), sharing with the United States the leadership in ethanol production. The search for alternative, renewable sources of energy, placed the spotlight on Brazilian ethanol, causing an increase in the production of bi-fuel automobiles, which estimates foresee will represent 85% of the market in a few years. Today, in Brazil, more than 9 million ha are currently used to cultivate sugarcane, but the demand for sugar and ethanol will have it increased to 64 million ha by the years 2018/2019. The growing demand for ethanol leads to an increase in production, which subsequently demands expansion of cultivated areas as well as the search for new technologies which will enable higher agricultural and industrial productivity. The current occupied agricultural area is reportedly, only 2.4%, and expansion has occurred in regions of the country where this culture will need adjustments due to soil and weather characteristics. Plants are exposed to adverse environmental conditions, and drought is the major abiotic factor that can damage its growth and development. Drought also limits the areas suitable to agriculture. It is known that, as for any crop, during vegetative growth water is essentially required to obtain maximum yield and drought events in this stage can significantly decrease productivity. Sugarcane is among the crops which produce a higher amount of biomass per unit of cultivated area and water requirement varies throughout the developing stages, thus for higher tillering and development of culms, there is a higher water requirement than during the maturation stage, when this need is diminished.

Determining ET is not straightforward due to the heterogeneity and complexity found in real-world hydrological basins. This situation is often compounded in regions with limited hydro-meteorological data that are facing rapid development of irrigated agriculture. Remote sensing (RS) techniques have proven useful in this regard. In this study, we compared the daily actual ET estimates derived from 3 remotely-sensed surface energy balance (SEB) models, namely, the Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL) model, the Operational Simplified Surface Energy Balance (SSEBop) model, and the Simplified Surface Balance Index (S-SEBI) model. These products were generated using the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite imagery for a total of 44 satellite overpasses in 2005, 2010, and 2015 in the heterogeneous, highly-utilized, rapidly-developing and data-limited Kilombero Valley (KV) river basin in Tanzania, eastern Africa. Our results revealed that the SEBAL model had a relatively high ET compared to other models and the SSEBop model had relatively low ET compared to the other models. In addition, we found that the S-SEBI model had a statistically similar ET as the ensemble mean of all models. Further comparison of SEB models’ ET estimates across different land cover classes and different spatial scales revealed that almost all models’ ET estimates were statistically comparable (based on the Wilcoxon’s test and the Levene’s test at a 95% confidence level), which implies fidelity between and reliability of the ET estimates. Moreover, all SEB models managed to capture the two spatially-distinct ET regimes in KV: the stable/permanent ET regime on the mountainous parts of the KV and the seasonally varied ET over the floodplain which contains a Ramsar site (Kilombero Valley Floodplain). Our results have the potential to be used in hydrological modelling to explore and develop integrated water resources management in the valley.

Food security—having physical and economic access to enough safe, nutritious food—is inextricably linked with environmental conditions. Weather extremes that impede growing conditions can limit or curtail food production, especially in regions where such conditions persist, and floods can cause rates of food-borne cholera to rise. Weather-related famines are now affecting millions of people in Africa, 12.5 million in Ethiopia alone. The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization’s Special Programme for Food Security (SPFS), located online at http://www.fao.org/spfs/, is one effort to help developing countries improve their food security. The SPFS was begun in 1994 and endorsed at the 1996 World Food Summit, where delegates called for a halving of the number of malnourished people in the world by the year 2015. The program aims to improve nations’ food security through rapid increases in food production and productivity, by reducing year-to-year variability in food production, and by improving people’s access to food. The SPFS webpage provides a look at the work done by the program, offering information in Arabic, Chinese, English, French, and Spanish. The program currently provides assistance in 100 countries, most of which are termed “low-income food deficit countries.” The SPFS uses a two-phase approach to introducing new food management methods, described on the Phases and Approaches page. It first provides farmers and others working on the project with the basic essentials—seeds and farming implements—along with training in best practices. Each project has four components, including water control, intensification of crop production systems, diversification of production systems, and analysis and resolution of obstacles. In the second phase, successful approaches are scaled up, and the SPFS works at the national level in member countries to create a nationwide strategy for food security. Once a community agrees to use a new system, it is adapted, with community input, to best meet the community’s needs and take advantage of local resources. For example, a treadle pump developed in Bangladesh is now in use in several other Asian and African countries. This pump, described on the Best Practices page, allows more land to be irrigated with less strenuous labor involved than use of a traditional watering can. The Case Studies page includes a description of how the treadle pump was introduced in Zambia, allowing many farmers to double their growing area and grow new crops, with significant increases in income. Two of the SPFS regions, Asia and Central America, have sections within the main site. Here visitors can find information on the project work going on in specific countries within each region. Each country page includes geographic and economic overviews, information on training sessions, an outline of how the SPFS was implemented in that country, and a list of technologies developed there. For example, in Bangladesh, the SPFS was involved in developing a new cooking stove that uses less fuel and discharges smoke from the indoor environment, therefore reducing indoor concentrations of hazardous particulate matter.",https://doi.org/10.1289/ehp.112-a549,

We investigated the effect of conservation agriculture (grass mulch cover and no-tillage) on water-saving on smallholder farms in the Ethiopian highlands. Irrigated onion and garlic were grown on local farms. Two main factors were considered: the first factor was conservation agriculture versus conventional tillage, and the second factor was irrigation scheduling using reference evapotranspiration (ETo) versus irrigation scheduling managed by farmers. Results showed that for both onion and garlic, the yield and irrigation water use efficiency (IWUE) was over 40% greater for CA than conventional tillage (CT). The soil moisture after irrigation was higher in CA compared with CT treatment while CA used 49 mm less irrigation water. In addition, we found that ETo-based irrigation was superior to the farmers’ irrigation practices for both crops. IWUE was lower in farmers irrigation practices due to lower onion and garlic yield responses to overirrigation and greater water application variability.",https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4441/11/10/2103/pdf?version=1570679845,

We know that irrigated agriculture plays a major role in the livelihoods of nations all over the world and South Africa is no exception. With the agricultural water-use sector being the largest of all water-use sectors in South Africa, there have been increased expectations that the sector should increase efficiency and reduce consumption in order to increase the amount of water available for other uses. Studies and research over 40 years, on the techniques of flood-, mobile- and micro-irrigation have contributed to the knowledge base of applying irrigation methods correctly. In a recent study on irrigation efficiency, the approach is that irrigation efficiency should be assessed by applying a water balance to a specific situation rather than by calculating vari ous performance indicators. The fraction of the water abstracted from the source that is utilised by the plant is called the beneficial water-use component, and optimised irrigation water supply is therefore aimed at maximising this component. It implies that water must be delivered from the source to the field both efficiently and effectively. Optimising water use at farm level requires careful consideration of the implications of decisions made during both development (planning and design), and management (operation and maintenance), taking into account technical, economic and environmental issues. An exciting, newly-developed South African Framework for Improved Efficiency of Irrigation Water Use covers 4 levels of water-management infrastructure: the water source, bulk conveyance system, the irrigation scheme and the irrigation farm. The water-balance approach can be applied at any level, within defined boundaries, or across all levels to assess perfor mance within the entire water management area.",https://doi.org/10.4314/wsa.v37i5.13,

Large parts of the world rely on rainfed agriculture for their food security. In Africa, 90% of the food production is from rainfed agriculture, generally with low yields and a high risk of crop failure. One of the main reasons for crop failure is the occurrence of dry spells during the growing season. Key indicators are the critical dry spell duration and the probability of dry spell occurrence. In this paper a new Markov-based framework is presented to spatially map the length of dry spells for fixed probabilities of non-exceedance. The framework makes use of spatially varying Markov coefficients that are correlated to readily available spatial information such as elevation and distance to the sea. The dry spell map thus obtained is compared to the spatially variable critical dry spell duration, based on soil properties and crop water requirements, to assess the probability of crop failure in different locations. The results show that in the Makanya catchment the length of dry spell occurrence is highly variable in space, even over relatively short distances. In certain areas the probability of crop failure reaches levels that make rainfed agricultural unsustainable, even close to areas where currently rainfed agriculture is successfully being practised. This method can be used to identify regions that are vulnerable to dry spells and, subsequently, to develop strategies for supplementary irrigation or rainwater harvesting.",https://hess.copernicus.org/articles/17/2161/2013/hess-17-2161-2013.pdf,

Therefore, this study was conducted to assess pesticide concentrations in ground and surface water and their risk to humans and aquatic life. The 9 km2 rural watershed Robit Bata in the Lake Tana Basin was selected. Crops were grown under rainfed and irrigated conditions. Pesticide use was assessed, and groundwater samples were collected from eight wells and surface water samples at the outlet twice in the rain phase and once in the dry phase. Samples were analyzed for chlorpyrifos, dimethoate, (α and β) endosulfan, profenofos, NO3−, and pH. Chlorpyrifos and endosulfan, which are strongly adsorbed and slowly degrading pesticides, were found in nearly all surface and groundwater samples, with maximum concentrations in surface water of 8 µg L−¹ for chlorpyrifos and 3 µg L−¹ endosulfan. Maximum groundwater concentrations were only slightly lower. The weakly adsorbed and fast degrading pesticides, dimethoate, and profenofos were detected only in the rain phase after spraying in the groundwater, indicating preferential transport to groundwater at depths of up to 9 m. The average concentration was 0.38 μg L−¹ for dimethoate in surface waters and 1.24 μg L−¹ in groundwater. Profenofos was not detected in surface water. In the groundwater, the average concentration was 0.05 μg L−¹. Surface water concentrations of chlorpyrifos and endosulfan were highly toxic to fish.

Such is the case of the rice root knot nematode Meloidogyne graminicola, adapted to flooded conditions and representing a risk to all types of rice agro-systems. It has been recently detected in Italy and added to the European and Mediterranean Plant Protection Organization (EPPO) Alert List. The presence of this nematode in Europe poses a threat to rice production, as there is a high probability to spread, due to trade activities and climate changes. In view of its importance, an extensive updated review was carried out. Abstract Rice (Oryza sativa L.) is one of the main cultivated crops worldwide and represents a staple food for more than half of the world population. Root-knot nematodes (RKNs), Meloidogyne spp., and particularly M. graminicola, are serious pests of rice, being, probably, the most economically important plant-parasitic nematode in this crop. M. graminicola is an obligate sedentary endoparasite adapted to flooded conditions. Until recently, M. graminicola was present mainly in irrigated rice fields in Asia, parts of the Americas, and South Africa. However, in July 2016, it was found in northern Italy in the Piedmont region and in May 2018 in the Lombardy region in the province of Pavia. Following the first detection in the EPPO region, this pest was included in the EPPO Alert List as its wide host range and ability to survive during long periods in environments with low oxygen content, represent a threat for rice production in the European Union. Considering the impact of this nematode on agriculture, a literature review focusing on M. graminicola distribution, biology, identification, and management was conducted.",https://www.mdpi.com/2079-7737/10/11/1163/pdf?version=1637233754,

Like many other crops, vegetable production is affected by poor soil fertility and shortages of irrigation water. Climate change-related drought has led to shortages of irrigation water in many countries, including South Africa. Farmers have used amendments such as inorganic fertilisers, organic manure, and compost to improve soil fertility. However, organic soil conditioners fall short in providing stable non-decomposable soil amendments, and inorganic fertilisers are expensive. A greenhouse pot experiment was conducted at the Agricultural Research Council Infruitec-Nietvoorbij, Stellenbosch, to assess the effect of zeolite (a soil conditioner) on cabbage and Swiss chard yield, water, and nutrient retention ability of the soil. Zeolite to sandy soil (zeolite: sandy soil) was applied in the ratio of 0:100%, 10:90%, 20:80% and 30:70%. Both cabbage and Swiss chard yields increased, irrigation requirements decreased, and soil acidity was ameliorated due to zeolite application. Cabbage yields were improved by the residual effects of zeolite, while the Swiss chard yield increase was due to vigorous vegetative growth of Swiss chard in zeolite-amended treatments, which led to more N and water utilisation, particularly in the second season. The study also highlighted the potential of zeolite in ameliorating the pH of acidic soils, as well as the water and nutrient-saving ability of zeolite, which are major challenges for crop production in sandy soils. However, there is a need to carry out further studies to find the cost-effective application rates of zeolite under on-farm conditions.",https://doi.org/10.35495/ajab.2021.11.387,

South Africa has included water reuse as a policy option; hence the aim of this study is to understand farmers' preferences regarding water reuse frameworks for irrigation. A choice modelling approach was applied to identify the elements defining these frameworks and to quantify their relative importance amongst farmers in the agricultural hinterland of Cape Town. The findings suggest that water reuse is acceptable to farmers in the area. Furthermore, they prefer options that guarantee good quality water and low levels of restrictions on use practices.

Improving food security in Africa will require a good understanding of farming systems yields as well as reducing yield gaps (i.e., the difference between potential yield and actual farmer yield). To this end, crop yield gap practices in African countries need to be understood to fill this gap while decreasing the environmental impacts of agricultural systems. For instance, the variability of yields has been demonstrated to be strongly controlled by soil fertilizer use, irrigation management, soil attribute, and the climate. Consequently, the quantitative assessment and mapping information of soil attributes such as nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), soil organic carbon (SOC), moisture content (MC), and soil texture (i.e., clay, sand and silt contents) on the ground are essential to potentially reducing the yield gap. However, to assess, measure, and monitor these soil yield-related parameters in the field, there is a need for rapid, accurate, and inexpensive methods. Recent advances in remote sensing technologies and high computational performances offer a unique opportunity to implement cost-effective spatiotemporal methods for estimating crop yield with important levels of scalability. However, researchers and scientists in Africa are not taking advantage of the opportunity of increasingly available geospatial remote sensing technologies and data for yield studies. The objectives of this report are to (i) conduct a review of scientific literature on the current status of African yield gap analysis research and their variation in regard to soil properties management by using remote sensing techniques; (ii) review and describe optimal yield practices in Africa; and (iii) identify gaps and limitations to higher yields in African smallholder farms and propose possible improvements. Our literature reviewed 80 publications and covered a period of 22 years (1998-2020) over many selected African countries with a potential yield improvement. Our results found that (i) the number of agriculture yield-focused remote sensing studies has gradually increased, with the largest proportion of studies published during the last 15 years; (ii) most studies were conducted exclusively using multispectral Landsat and Sentinel sensors; and (iii) over the past decade, hyperspectral imagery has contributed to a better understanding of yield gap analysis compared to multispectral imagery; (iv) soil nutrients (i.e., NPK) are not the main factor influencing the studied crop productivity in Africa, whereas clay, SOC, and soil pH were the most examined soil properties in prior papers.",https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/13/22/4602/pdf?version=1637225716,

Here, we present the remaining four modules, which represent anthropogenic activities: a crop growth module, a reservoir operation module, an environmental flow requirement module, and an anthropogenic withdrawal module. In addition, we discuss the results of a global water resources assessment using the integrated model. The crop growth module is a relatively simple 10 model based on heat unit theory and potential biomass and harvest index concepts. The performance of the crop growth module was examined extensively because agricultural water comprises approximately 70% of total water withdrawal in the world. The estimated crop calendar showed good agreement with earlier reports for wheat, maize, and rice in major countries of production. The estimated irrigation water withdrawal also 15 showed fair agreement with country statistics, but tended to underestimate countries in the Asian monsoon region.

It then zeroes in on the twists and turns of one village’s determined struggle to resist a state-allied foreign investor and how civil society allies were able to help. The concluding discussion briefly pulls together initial evidence on the new Macky Sall government’s agricultural and land reform policies and describes how African peasants and pastoralists are organising against policies they see as making them dependent on foreign-controlled inputs, worsening the risk of losing their land, turning their sons and daughters into miserably paid farm workers, and destroying both the environment and rural communities (Via Campesina 2012).",https://www.scienceopen.com/document_file/ffa8fb83-4b3c-4d07-b920-82776aa61f4f/ScienceOpen/03056244.2012.711076.pdf,

Although humans have been aware of the crucial relationship between human health and the environment for millennia, there still is a tendency to separate health and environmental issues and deal with them independently. To protect the environment, promote human health, and practice sustainable development, this attitude must be changed. Environmental health has received considerable political recognition since the 1972 Stockholm Conference on the Human Environment, which created the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP). Health impacts of environmental degradation figured prominently in several chapters of Agenda 21 (United Nations 1993) adapted in 1992 at the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development. Several meetings of European ministers of environment and health have resulted in considerable improvements in the interaction among their ministries. A meeting of the health and environment ministers of the Americas was held in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, 4–5 March 2002, and a similar meeting of the environment and health ministers of African countries is being planned for 2004. At the World Summit on Sustainable Development (WSSD) held in Johannesburg, South Africa, 26 August–4 September 2002, the Member States of the United Nations adopted the WEHAB (water, energy, health, agriculture, and biodiversity) Agenda (WSSD 2002). The WEHAB health agenda suggests many issues that must be addressed, including environmental health issues and the need for intersectoral cooperation, more information, capacity-building, and more financial resources. The New Partnership for Africa’s Development has several environmental and health goals in its action plan. Further, many multilateral environmental agreements, such as the Montreal Protocol (UNEP Ozone Secretariat 2000), the POPs (Persistent Organic Pollutants) Convention (UNEP, Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee 2001), and the PIC Convention [Prior Informed Consent (Rotterdam Convention 1998)], are health-related. Many countries, particularly in Europe, are developing national environmental health action plans and local environmental health action plans. Despite the surge in international, regional, national, and local recognition of the link between the environment and human health, the burden of disease in developing countries is increasing. At the WSSD, Canada, with the support of the World Health Organization (WHO) and the UNEP, proposed the Health and Environment Linkages Initiative (UNEP 2002). This initiative now being implemented by the WHO and the UNEP, with the support of Canada, seeks to build capacity for more effective policy responses through consolidation of the knowledge base, development of strategies for intersectoral cooperation, and capacity building. The initiative will be completed by a multidisciplinary international group of experts from both developed and developing countries. An estimated 25% of all preventable illness is caused by environmental factors. In Africa, the environmental contribution is even higher, with approximately 35% of the burden of disease due to environmental factors (UNEP, United Nations Children’s Fund, WHO 2002). Wastewater is treated in less than 35% of cities in the developing world, and between one-third and one-half of the solid wastes generated within most cities in lowand middle-income countries are not collected. Approximately 3.5–5 million cases of acute pesticide poisonings occur each year. Every year, over 5 million children 0–14 years of age die, mainly in the developing world, from diseases related to the environment, such as malaria, dengue, acute respiratory infections, and diarrhea. Worldwide, 500 million children are debilitated by environmental diseases. Many, if not most, environmental threats to health are aggravated by persistent poverty, political conflicts, natural and man-made disasters, and social inequity. Every hour, 15,000 people worldwide die of an infectious disease, and more than half of those are children under 5 years of age; 2 million children under 5 years of age die every year from acute respiratory infections, for which indoor air pollution is a major causative factor (Gopalan and Saksena 1999; Smith et al. 1999; WHO 2002; World Resources Institute 1998). Most developing countries have no control over the noise generated by traffic, industry, public address systems, firework displays, and loud music. Noise interferes with concentration and sleep, causes physiologic stress, contributes to a reduction in cooperative behavior, triggers aggressive conduct, and may cause hearing loss. Another serious environmental and public health problem is caused by water pollution from animal waste runoff, as well as the widespread use of antibiotics and hormones to speed up growth of animals. Some environmental health hazards should be a priority, including the lack of clean household water for consumption and hygiene, poor sanitation, air pollution, vector-borne diseases, chemical hazards, and unintentional injuries (accidents). Environmental health is a multisectoral problem, which requires coordination and cooperation among the many different sectors in order to improve the lives of millions of people. An intersectoral approach can be effective only if all sectors involved—governmental departments (i.e., health, housing, energy, environment, water, industry and planning, agriculture) and members of the community (i.e., parents, teachers, health and social workers)—work together in a truly integrated partnership. Because individual sectors lack the necessary information and tools to completely understand the impact of their activities on human health, even seemingly beneficial development projects, such as dams and irrigation schemes, if not properly designed, can negatively affect health through the changing of habitats for disease vectors. The converse, however, may also be true; health projects can negatively affect other sectors: for example, a project to eliminate certain disease vectors may also eliminate a variety of other, possibly beneficial, species at the same time. Human health and well-being are also intimately tied to the health of life-sustaining ecosystems; yet this complex relationship is rarely taken into account in either mainstream health or natural",https://doi.org/10.1289/ehp.111-a446,

The combination of modern sensor technologies, the Internet, and advanced irrigation equipment combined in an Internet of Things (IoT) approach allow a relatively precise control of agricultural irrigation and creating the opportunity for high efficiency of water use for agricultural demands. This IoT approach can thereby increase the resilience of agricultural systems in the face of complex demands for water use. Most previous works on agricultural IoT systems are in the context of countries with higher levels of economic development. However, in Rwanda, with a low level of economic development, the advantages of efficient water use from the application of IoT technology requires overcoming constraints such as lack of irrigation control for individual farmers, lack of access to equipment, and low reliability of power and Internet access. In this work, we describe an approach for adapting previous studies to the Rwandan context for rice (Oryza sativa) farming with irrigation. The proposed low cost system would automatically provide irrigation control according to seasonal and daily irrigational needs when the system sensors and communications are operating correctly. In cases of system component failure, the system switches to an alternative prediction mode and messages farmers with information about the faults and realistic irrigation options until the failure is corrected. We use simulations to demonstrate, for the Muvumba Rice Irrigation Project in Northeast Rwanda, how the system would respond to growth stage, effective rainfall, and evapotranspiration for both correct operation and failure scenarios.",https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0472/10/10/431/pdf,

Across Africa, south of the Sahara, agriculture is the predominant sector in the economies of most countries accounting for between 30 to 40 percent of gross domestic product, and the sector is a leading source of jobs for over two-thirds of Africa's population. With an abundance of labor, land and untapped water, Sub-Saharan Africa has the resources necessary for a massive expansion of agricultural production. Notwithstanding these advantages, over the last 40 years Africa has been steadily losing its share of the global agricultural market. Today, Thailand exports more food products than all of Sub-Saharan Africa combined. The “Green Revolution” that transformed tropical agriculture in Asia and Latin America largely bypassed Africa. A confluence of factors – increasing prices for African agricultural products, booming urban food markets, many opportunities for expanding irrigated area, greater interest by development partners, improved policy environment, technological innovations, rising private sector interest, framework for climate-smart agriculture, and improved infrastructure – present a golden opportunity for African agriculture to realize its full potential. Responding to the challenges, the World Bank is scaling up its support for African agriculture. The medium-term plan is to scale up lending to US$3 billion a year, with ambitious targets in key thematic areas – irrigation, land administration, access to technology, inputs, financial services and markets, and climate-smart agriculture – so that Sub-Saharan Africa can benefit fully from the transformative opportunity. Greater South-South learning and collaboration, and strengthening of African institutions and building capacity are all needed.

Additionally, fresh water resources are becoming limited and routine irrigation practices in conventional agriculture are causing a steady increase in soil salinity. This will lead to further desertification of affected areas in the future with concomitant reduction in the yield of crops known for human and animal consumption. Consequently it has become imperative to search for suitable alternatives and develop ecologically sustainable and economically sound biological systems that can use low quality water and drought affected saline lands to produce plants of economic importance. A large number of halophytes could be used as animal forage/fodder without encroaching upon arable lands and irrigation water. This paper emphasizes the agricultural importance of these salt tolerant plants in a world where most of the water is saline at any given moment. However, the economic use should be in accordance with the ecological demands suited to particular biomes. Pakistan for example, is spread over an area of 800,000 square kilometers with varied climatic conditions ranging from temperate to sub-tropical desert, eventually displaying a high biodiversity in local flora including halophytes. About 16% of the world halophytic flora is distributed in Pakistan with more than 410 species and among them >100 have potential economic usages as cattle feed. A number of these species are also distributed in the regions between the Atlantic coasts of Africa to western India. The Sindh/Balochistan coast of Pakistan extending from Seer Creek to Jiwani and from coast to mountains including Indus basin are rich sanctuaries for many of these plants. There is a need to conduct systematic survey of this flora, ascertain their chemical characteristics for nutritive value and subsequently identify the species suited to particular conditions through animal feeding trials. Some of these trials have already indicated a promise for ecologically sustainable use of perennial grasses such as Panicum antidotale, formerly identified as Panicum turgidum and Desmostachya bipinnata that may be taken to commercial scale.

Changes of hydro-climatic forcings may have significant impacts on water resources use, considering the possible effects on irrigation requirements and crop water stress. In this work, a comprehensive estimation of crop water requirements over the 1970–2019 period is presented, considering 26 main agricultural products over a 5 arcmin resolution global grid. The assessment is based on a daily-scale hydrological model considering rainfed and irrigated scenarios, driven by hydro-climatic forcings derived from ERA5, the most recent climate reanalysis product within the Climate Change Service of the Copernicus Programme. Results show the heterogeneous impact of climate variability on harvested areas of the world, quantified by water stressed days and irrigation requirement rates. Increases of irrigation requirement rates were found on more than 60% of irrigated lands, especially in regions like South Europe, North-East China, West US, Brazil and Australia, where the mean rate increased more than 100 mm yr−1 from 1970s to 2010s. The daily analysis of water requirements shows that crops require significantly more days of irrigation per season, especially in Europe, Africa and South-East Asia.

Globally, rainfed agriculture is practised in 80% of the total agricultural area and generates 62% of the world's staple food (FAOSTAT, 2011). Taking into consideration global water scarcity and increases in demand for non-agricultural uses of water, expansion of the area under irrigation in developing countries does not appear to be a realistic scenario to address the challenge of food security. According to the latest climate change scenarios, 20-year extreme annual daily maximum temperature will likely increase by about 1–3°C by mid-21st century, and by about 2–5°C by the late 21st century, depending on the region and emissions scenario (IPCC, 2012). Based on historical data collected in Africa on more than 20,000 trials (1999–2007), each “degree day” spent above 30° reduced yield by 1% under optimal conditions, and that penalty rose up to 1.7% under water-limited conditions (Lobell et al., 2011). The impact of a changing climate is not only about temperature increase, but it is also affecting the magnitude of rainfall and its distribution, and therefore its availability at critical times of the crop cycle (Feng et al., 2013): in fact, while the total amount of rain increased in Africa over the last few years, the erratic and unpredictable nature of the drought and floods cycle also increased (Douglas et al., 2008). As such, improving the drought tolerance of crops, increasing the efficiency of water use and enhancing agricultural water productivity under rain-fed conditions is a number one priority today in a growing number of countries. The recent genomics and bioinformatics revolutions offer real opportunities for dissecting drought tolerance into component traits, and then using genomic approaches to select plants with favorable alleles at the underlying genes. Although major achievements have been reported recently by the private sector, the development of effective systems for breeding complex traits such as drought tolerance continues to be a major challenge in the public sector, despite significant investments in research and development. Adoption of molecular breeding in developing countries remains very limited. This is due mainly to a shortage of well-trained personnel, inadequate high-throughput capacity, poor phenotyping infrastructure, and a lack of information systems or adapted analytic tools (Ribaut et al., 2010). Created in 2003, the CGIAR Generation Challenge Programme (GCP) is a time-bound initiative ending in 2014. GCP's mission is to use plant genetic diversity, advanced genomic science and comparative biology to develop tools and technologies that will support plant breeders in the developing world in their efforts to produce better crop varieties for resource-poor farmers in drought-prone environments. Generic facilitating technologies developed by GCP include standardized phenotyping protocols, whole-plant physiology modeling, molecular breeding simulation studies, decision-support tools, procedures for creating low-cost trait diagnostics and high-throughput array-based genotyping systems. Since 2009, GCP has been coordinating the Integrated Breeding Platform (IBP). IBP is a one-stop shop where breeders can access the analytical tools and support services to manage their projects, find new knowledge and training opportunities, and access fora for discussion with peers. Drought tolerance is the main target trait of the Programme, and genomics-assisted breeding for better crop production under water-limited conditions is at the heart of the research supported by GCP during its second phase. Good genetic studies are impossible without reliable phenotypic data, and plant phenotyping must be conducted locally. Most national breeding programmes from developing countries working in partnership in the GCP network have in common a scarcity of suitable field infrastructure for collection of accurate phenotypic data, especially for stresses such as drought. Therefore, GCP recognizes that accurate and reliable phenotyping is the main bottleneck in drought-tolerance research, and is allocating significant resources to improve crop phenotyping in target environments under different water regimes. To achieve this objective, geographic information system (GIS) tools and soil water balance models have been used to describe the drought scenario faced by the crops in different target GCP environments, and to compare and cluster the phenotyping locations for GCP projects. Facilities and expertise in the different locations have been evaluated, needs have been prioritized, and today GCP is investing about four million US dollars to improve the local infrastructure of partners involved in GCP projects. Complementary to the effort to improve infrastructure is the need to develop tools and protocols for improving characterization of environments and plant phenotypes, enhancing expertise in testing locations, and stimulating the development and use of innovative drought tolerance-related traits and protocols (e.g., carbon isotope discrimination, spectroradiometry, thermal imaging). This manual contributes to this effort. The first part of this manual addresses—from a generic perspective—global issues and challenges related to environment selection and characterization, experimental field design, trait selection, and data analysis and management. The second part of the manual is crop-specific for a set of GCP target crops. Each article presents the state-of-the-art of research on drought tolerance and the protocols that are more specifically used to measure different traits for each of those crops.",https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fphys.2013.00289/pdf,

Considering the growing pressure on finite freshwater and soil resources, it becomes clear that the challenge of feeding tomorrow’s world population is, to a large extent, about improved water productivity within present land use. Meanwhile water requirements for different purposes will increase, so all efforts focused on a rational use of water will be indispensable. Ninety-five per cent of current population growth occurs in developing countries and a significant proportion of these people still depend on a predominantly rain-fed-based rural economy. Agriculture is by far the largest water-use sector, accounting for about 70% of all water withdrawn worldwide from rivers and aquifers for agricultural, domestic and industrial purposes. In several developing countries irrigation represents up to 95% of all water withdrawn, and it plays a major role in food production and food security (Comprehensive Assessment of Water Management in Agriculture, 2007). In the arid and semiarid climates, irrigation is often essential to achieve economically viable crop productions. Benefits from irrigation may be partially offset by detrimental effects of rising water tables and soil salinization, inefficient water delivery systems and poor on-farm irrigation techniques. In the absence of sufficient canal water supplies, infrastructure and a well-designed and effective monitoring and communication system, moving towards the on-demand system will be unproductive. For the long term sustainability of the irrigation system, improvements in the performance of the present water allocations and on-farm water management practices seems to be more necessary as any other practice (Sarwar et al., 2001). The agricultural development strategies of most of the African, European and American countries depend on the possibility of maintaining, improving and expanding irrigated agriculture (Siebert et al., 2006). However, as the pressure on water resources increases, irrigation is facing growing competition from other water-use sectors and is becoming a threat to the environment in an increasing number of regions. Intensification of agricultural activities under arid or semiarid conditions involves irrigation, fertilization and organic additives, applied in varying amounts to the annual cropped and orchards areas. In such scenario, the efficient use of water in agriculture is a main concern worldwide. Irrigation management should focus in the adoption of practices that enhance the efficient use of water so that other sectors can have more water for economic use. At the same time, it is equally important to develop watershed or irrigation systems water management policies that enable irrigation managers or planners to optimally manage scarce available water resources and maintain under sustainable condition the agricultural production processes (Sarwar et al., 2001). A comprehensive, complete, and quantitatively defined problem analysis, including alternative strategies for solving problems, can be defined and evaluated. Definite solutions to all these problems are impossible to realize solely at the farm level. Regional or watershed solutions have to be found that are based on an integrated approach to ground- and surface-water management along with improved on-farm water management and operation of the irrigation systems (Kumar and Singh, 2003). Diagnosis in water management is being supported more recently with the help of mathematical models simulating the various processes involved and their interactions in the system. A change from a natural habitat to intensive agricultural practices leads to increased leachates production and pollution risks. Non-point source pollution from nutrient and pesticide application has the potential to degrade water resources (Troiano et al., 1993). It is imperative that the impact of farming practices and proposed best management practices on water quality be evaluated so that appropriate practices can be developed to minimize pollution.",http://www.scielo.cl/pdf/chiljar/v69s1/AT01.pdf,

The aim of the present study was to quantify and evaluate the pollution levels and the potential sources of soil, irrigation water and vegetable contamination by the metals As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Pb, Co and Zn in the urban gardens of Lubumbashi (DR Congo). The contamination, pollution and enrichment levels of the gardens were determined based on different indices in order to rank the soils. The results show that soils, waters and vegetables present contamination levels that represent a serious concern for human health. All soils presented contamination indices ranging from low (72% of the soils) to very high (3.4% of the soils) metal (copper, lead, zinc) contamination. The Cu and Cd contents varied between 1355 mg/kg et 236 mg/kg, much higher than the World Health Organisation (WHO) thresholds (100 mg/kg for Cu and 2 mg/kg for Cd). Moreover, the water used for crop and garden irrigation presented high Pb (57% of the waters), Fe (52%), Cu (19%) and Cd (10%) contamination levels, above the Association Française de Normalisation (AFNOR) U4441 toxicity thresholds (2 mg/kg for Cu; 0.1 mg/kg for Fe and 0.01 mg/kg for Pb) for crop irrigation. Finally, the vegetables produced in these gardens and sold in the local markets had very high metal content (47% contained Cu; 100% contained copper and cobalt) above the WHO standard (10 mg/kg for Cu, 2 mg/kg for Cd and 1 mg/kg for Co) for human consumption. In the face of these issues, it would be preferable to consider cheaper, more sustainable techniques that reduce soil-to-plant metal transfer.",https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4395/13/2/357/pdf?version=1676363483,

Due to increased demand and value, many farmers have not only begun growing it but have also adopted modern farming methods which include application of fertilizers, pesticides, compost manure, and irrigation. Yet some of these agricultural practices such as application of fertilizers and pesticides are known to increase the concentration of heavy metals such as Cd, Pb, Zn and Cu in the soil. Some of these heavy metals such as Pband Cd are toxic even at low concentrations while Zn, Cu, Fe and Cr though essential in the body, are toxic at high levels This call for monitoring to make sure that the levels of heavy metals in khat do not exceed the threshold limits recommended by WHO due to their adverse health effects to man.

Such schemes were envisaged by imperialists such as Cecil Rhodes, Thomas Smartt and Percy Fitzpatrick and became more viable with the promulgation of the Cape Colony’s Irrigation Act of 1893 which extended the facility of government loan funds to private individuals. In 1900 a Scottish immigrant, CF Rigg, obtained land on the Breede River in the Western Cape which was divided after a survey into irrigation plots for private purchase. Thus, Rigg began one of the first private real estate schemes in South Africa. Apart from a number of poor white Afrikaner ostrich farmers, who left the drought- stricken Oudtshoorn district in search of better agricultural conditions by purchasing plots from Rigg, he also targeted British World War One veterans. Rigg compiled an elaborate and professional recruitment brochure which included detailed information on aspects such as soil conditions, climatology and geographical features, agricultural possibilities, transport facilities and shipping fares from Britain to South Africa. This article explores the historical development of Rigg’s irrigation settlement and infrastructural development such as the construction of a weir and canal system (which included the drilling and blasting of an irrigation tunnel) under the guise of white colonisation and settlement in the age of empire in early twentieth century South Africa. As the number of purchasers of irrigation plots increased over time, Rigg’s scheme, originally called Riggton, would gradually develop into the town and agricultural community of Bonnievale, derived from the Scottish word for “beautiful” and the local railway siding Vale.",https://newcontree.org.za/index.php/nc/article/download/274/327,

One hundred and fifteen tall fescue accessions, including 25 commercial cultivars, were divided into five groups based on their origination. The morphological traits, including plant height, spike length, pulvinus distance, spikelet count, branch count per spike, spike count per plant, and spike weight in different accessions were determined under field conditions in 2013 and 2014. There was significant genotypic variation in morphological traits among the 115 tall fescue accessions. Wild accessions exhibited a greater variation in the morphological traits than commercial cultivars. Close correlations were found among plant height, spike length, pulvinus distance, and spikelet count. The results of this suggest plant height, spike length, pulvinus distance, and spikelet count could be used as key morphological traits for evaluating all fescue germplasm effectively. Tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb.), a cross-pollinated, hexaploid, cool-season perennial grass, has been widely grown as an important forage and turf grass throughout the world (Aiken and Strickland, 2013; Seal, 1983). The grass belongs to the tribe Festuceae, subfamily Festucoideae, and family Poaceae (Seal, 1983). Natural populations are distributed in temperate and cool climates throughout Europe, North–West Africa, North America, and west and central Asia ( Cernoch et al., 2003). Tall fescue not only enhances the natural beauty of the environment and increases the value of residential and commercial property (Bonos et al., 2006; Ha et al., 1992), but also provides numerous benefits to humans including providing feed for millions of beef cattle, horses, sheep, and countless wild animals (Wang et al., 2001). Therefore, tall fescue played an important role in pastoral industry, ecological landscaping, soil conservation, and athletic industry (Wang and Xie, 2007). The genetic variability for morphological traits is the key component of breeding programs for broadening the gene pool (ChtourouGhorbel et al., 2011). Variety fescue is the cosmopolitan and ubiquitous taxon, and provides the most important and diverse genetic resources in the species as forage and turf. These variations might be attributed to difference in the genetic constitutions of the population or in the environment where they grow (Dutta et al., 2013). Chtourou-Ghorbel et al. (2011) reported that substantial variation in morphological characteristics among tall fescue cultivars was currently being lost due to severe genetic erosion associated with overgrazing, irregular rainfall, and the loss of rangeland in Tunisia. Majidi et al. (2009) indicated that morphological variation in tall fescue germplasm was heritable, and that several traits including plant height and dry matter yield had a high narrow sense heritability value. Morphological traits are of great importance in selecting rational parents for hybridization breeding of many crops. The knowledge of genotypic diversity was indispensable for efficient utilization of genetic resources and breeding (Beyene et al., 2006; Finger et al., 2010). Plant height, spike length, spikelet count, spike count per plant, and spike weight are major components of plant yield as selection criteria in breeding (Topal et al., 2004). Ebrahimiyan et al. (2012) reported significant genotypic variation in plant height, flag-leaf length, and flag-leaf width among the seventy five tall fescues. The variation of morphological traits was influenced by genotype and environment (Chtourou-Ghorbel et al., 2011). Niazkhani et al. (2014) observed that the plant height had lower direct and positive effect on dry forage yield (correlation coefficient equals to 0.051). Knowledge of relationship among the morphological traits was the basic and most important for plant selection in a breeding program (Hasan et al., 2013). Leaf roughness, poor regeneration ability, and poor stress resistance limit wide utilization of tall fescue (Carrow, 1996; Cross et al., 2013; Xu et al., 2006). Excellent tall fescue cultivars are not only able to produce more biomass, but also survive stress conditions. Fortunately, there was tongs of tall fescue germplasm composed of landraces, commercial cultivars, and breeding lines (Li et al., 2010). Thus, improvement of tall fescue might encourage its use as a forage grass species (Easton et al., 1994). However, genetic variation in morphological traits of tall fescue has not been understood very well. Describing the morphological traits of a large tall fescue collection is still costly and time-consuming. Selecting and describing numerous traits within smaller sample was reasonable and possible. The objectives of this study were to investigate the phenotypic variation of the morphological characteristics and to determine the correlation between the morphological traits. The findings of this study would add new information for better understanding the genetic diversity of tall fescue and therefore facilitate breeding design.

The mean annual sunshine duration was 1450–2050 h. The tall fescue accessions used in this study consisted of landraces and commercial cultivars. The distribution and origin of the 115 tall fescue accessions, including 25 commercial cultivars, were listed in Figure 1 and Table 1. The accessions were divided into five groups based on origination (i.e., Cultivar, America, Europe, Africa, and Asia). A single seed from each accession was initially placed on a layer of filter paper which soakedwater in petri dishes inMay, 2012. The petri dishes were placed in the dark at 20 C until germination, and then transferred to 300–500 mmol photons per m·s natural sunlight for 14 h photoperiod. After 2 weeks, all accessions were transferred to plastic containers (15 cm deep and 14 cm diameter) filled with a mixture of cultivation medium and sand (1:1, v/v). Each accessionwas cloned multiple times by tillers to maintain genetic uniformity. All accessions were established in a walk-in growth room with daily maximum and minimum temperature of 24 and 20 C, with a 14-h photoperiod and light intensity of 300 mmol photons per m·s, respectively. They were watered daily to maintain well watered conditions, and fertilized weekly with one-half strengthHoagland’s solution (Hoagland and Arnon, 1950). The grasses were mowed weekly to 7 cm canopy height. In Sep. 2012, the experimental plots were fertilized with 49 kg N/ha, 98 kg P/ha, and 98 kg K/ha. Peat soil (2-cm thick) was applied, and then the soil was subjected to deep-tillage (25–30 cm), raked for smoothness, and then covered with sand (2-cm deep). The 115 accessions were transplanted to the experimental field in a 1.5 · 1.5 m-lattice in Oct. 2012. The fertilizer with the ratio of N:P:K at 21:6:13 was applied in Mar. 2013 to provide 49 kg N/ha. The tall fescue was fertilized monthly from April through November in 2013 with 49 kg N/ha compound fertilizer and urea. After the data were collected in 13 June 2013, the grasses were mowed to the height of 10 cm, and no mowing was conducted at other times during the whole experimental stage. In 2014, the tall fescue was fertilized at 49 kg N/ha each time in April and May with compound fertilizer and urea. Data were collected on 28 May and 7 June in 2014. The experimental field was irrigated as needed to prevent from wilt in 2 years. When irrigated, water was applied to wet the entire root zone. The experimental sites were syringed occasionally during sunny, rain-free periods. Measurements. Data were collected on the plant height, spike length, pulvinus distance, spikelet count, branch count per spike, spike count per plant, and spikeweight from4 June to 13 June in 2013 and from 28 May to 7 June in 2014. Plant height was determined as the distance from the ground level to tip of a plant. Seven uniform plants from accession per replicate were measured and the average was used for statistical analysis. Spike length was defined as the distance from the bottom to the tip of spike. Four plants with an average size from each accession per plot were measured and the average was used for analysis. Pulvinus distance was the distance from main spike neck to flag leaf pulvinus. Four plants with an average size from each Table 1.

Citing climate change and growing populations, there is especially a notable shift towards promoting groundwater for irrigation to ensure food security. Increased use of the resource will undoubtedly be accompanied with new questions of governance, with groundwater overexploitation in other parts of the world functioning as a strong cautionary tale. This article provides an overview of the current groundwater governance literature on sub-Saharan Africa. Using a critical water governance lens we analyse how groundwater governance is framed, what terms, categories, and measurements are used to describe and assess groundwater governance, and whose perspectives are considered. We also assess whether groundwater governance research has taken place across sub-Saharan African countries in a balanced way. We find that groundwater governance research in sub-Saharan Africa, even more so than elsewhere, ignores the voices and perspectives of those physically encountering the resource. Instead, it is dominated by the views of formal, technical groundwater experts focusing on the need for more hydrogeological data and formal policies. While the existing contributions to the literature are valuable, the current bias in perspectives calls for others to join the field of groundwater governance and to supplement current conceptualisations and approaches with those of users and others dealing with groundwater management on a daily basis. We argue that groundwater users’ practical governance experiences, locally adapted solutions and knowledges, can add important complementary perspectives and insights towards crafting effective, sustainable and equitable groundwater governance processes across the continent.",https://storage.googleapis.com/jnl-up-j-ijc-files/journals/1/articles/1313/65bb79e1d46c3.pdf,

It is the most important oilseed crop in Ethiopia. Sesame belongs to the Pedaliaceae family, which is adapted to hot areas [1] (Thakur, 1975). It is annual plant with broad leaves 2.5-5cm long, white, bell shaped inflorescence, with seeds of white, yellow, brown or black color [2]. It has a nickname ‘Queen of oil seeds’ due to its high quality polyunsaturated stable fatty acid. The stability of its oil is related to the polyunsaturated fatty acids reducing oxidative rancidity [1] (Balasubramanian & Palaniappal, 2011) and the presence of natural antioxidants sesamol and sesamolinol [3]. Sesame is produced as a cash crop. It can be used for home consumption, but in addition to its oil for food, its byproduct oil cake, is an important animal feed. In Ethiopia, farmers used to burn the stalk after threshing, recently it is becoming an important raw material for different industrial purposes. Sudan is the major sesame producer in Africa followed by Nigeria, Somalia, Uganda and Ethiopia. In Ethiopia, sesame is very expensive, especially, due to its demand as a cash crop, for food and animal feed when compared with other oil crops. Sesame, sunflower, safflower, linseed and Niger seed are the most common oilseed crops in Ethiopia. Sesame is the second most agricultural export commodity in Ethiopia, next to coffee in annual export earning contributing about 14% of the total world export (Monitor Group 2012). Due to the increase in price, production of sesame is increasing in Ethiopia. Ethiopia’s export share 1.5% in volume and 1.9% in value to the World market in 1997, had grown to 8.9% and 8.3% in 2004 respectively [4].

It is projected that over 690 million people around the world went hungry in 2019 and the COVID-19 pandemic is increasing the vulnerabilities and insufficiencies of global food systems. Food security is a human right and the government of South Africa is legally bound by the constitution to ensure food security for all. However, food insecurity in the country is owing to insufficient access to food because of structural poverty and inequality dynamics with a strong racial footprint rather than a shortage of food. Additionally, the rising cost of living, limited investment in agricultural development, and high dependency ratios especially in low-income households are some of the factors contributing to food insecurity in the country. Consequently, household-level food security is a major challenge to the South African government and policymakers. The government has strong social and economic rights commitments in place to achieve this goal and improve the lives of rural communities that are dependent on agriculture as a source of livelihood. Using household survey data, the study seeks to investigate the role played by cash transfers on household productive capacities and food security status within the context of a small pace of transition from homestead to irrigated farming in the former homelands of the Eastern Cape Province. The lower bound poverty line of R 758 (on average $57 USD), was used to determine household food security status. Simple random sampling was employed to select 158 respondents. The propensity score matching method was employed using the Nearest Neighbour and Kernel matching techniques to estimate the treatment effects and compare the outcomes of participation in irrigation farming and receipts of cash transfers in comparison with the non-irrigators. Both matching methods revealed that irrigation farming enhanced the per capita food expenditure by at least ZAR 2 738.88 and ZAR 2 790.37, which then improves household food security. The findings also revealed that cash transfers increase the farmers’ production activities by ZAR 1 467.90 and ZAR 1 478.00. Evidently, the cash transfers necessitate the purchase of more and improved production inputs and access to climate-smart practices such as irrigation, which then improves irrigators’ production capacities and, as a result, reduces vulnerability and improves livelihoods and food security.",https://doi.org/10.1080/23311886.2022.2147138,

The legume Lentil (Lens culinaris Medik) is one of the largest sources of protein with an average of 25% of all seeds produced worldwide. When used in crop rotation, it fertilizes the soil, as is the case in North Africa and this plant holds an important place throughout the world. In Algeria, lentil is largely growth in the semi-arid zones of the interior plains characterized by various abiotic constraints such as terminal drought which causes significant losses in lentil yield every year. For this purpose, the cases in this study aims to evaluate the effect of end of cycle water stress on the behavior of four varieties of lentil (Syrie 229, Metropole, Balkan 75 and Ibela) and to elucidate the plant’s morpho-physiological and biochemical parameters involved in tolerance and to assess varieties which could be grown under water stress conditions. The experiment was conducted in a laboratory and greenhouse with a well-controlled condition. The experiment was arranged in a completely randomized design of two factors (water stress and varieties) with four replications and two treatments. Not treated plants (without water stress application) were utilized as control. The four tested genotypes were subjected to two water regimes, one irrigated throughout the cycle (No stressed) used as a control, the other one stressful from the beginning of flowering till seed’s filling stages (stressed). The study covered the variation of the relative water content in leaves as well as the leaf surface, the rate of proline and soluble sugars of the leaves and the total seed protein content. The obtained results showed that the studied genotypes behaved differently to the water stress. Thus, a significant decrease was observed in the relative water content from 75.29% to 70.71% and in the leaf area from 16.76 cm2 to 13.63 cm2. An opposite behavior was observed on the osmoticum accumulated as a response to water deficit. A significant increase in proline (150.14 μg/g DM to 203.69 μg/g DM) and in soluble sugars stress (60.42 μg/g DM to 110.21 μg/g DM) was detected in leaves under stressed conditions. The terminal water stress resulted also in an increase in protein content in lentil seeds from a mean value of 22.08% to 24.84%. Regarding the obtained results, Metropole genotype seems to be the most tolerant cultivar to water stress followed by Balkan 755.

So it was welcome news when researchers at the University of California, Riverside, reported in the December 2004 Plant Journal what could be a way to improve the drought resistance of maize. Maize is now the most widely produced cereal in the world, having overtaken rice and wheat. Many areas where maize is grown, including parts of Africa, are vulnerable to drought. Ethylene, a compound produced by plants, is believed to help plants adapt to stress, but can also cause leaves to wither in response to dry conditions. Daniel Gallie and colleagues found that the leaves of reduced-ethylene plants remained green longer than normal plants, and that reducing a plant’s ethylene production postponed withering and maintained leaf function. Gallie and his colleagues identified transposons that had knocked out the enzyme that starts ethylene production in maize. Transposons are DNA elements that move from one position in the genome to another, knocking out the gene at the new position and replacing it. After screening thousands of plants, they found plants with mutant DNA affecting two of the three genes that make an enzyme needed for ethylene production. After confirming that the knockout mutants indeed produced less ethylene, they multiplied those plants and examined their growth in Riverside’s research fields. Not only did the mutant plants’ leaves stay green longer than normal plants, the plants’ leaves experienced higher-than-normal photosynthesis rates. It’s still unknown whether the mutation improves the plants’ cereal productivity as well as leaf production, and how reduction of ethylene affects other plant functions. Jerry Cohen, deputy division director for Molecular and Cellular Biosciences at the National Science Foundation, says that in maize, ethylene also encourages rooting and adaptation to flooding; simply reducing ethylene in maize, he says, “could end up with nice plants lying on the ground.” Still, he adds, this study opens many new possibilities for maize improvement. Mary Eubanks, a maize researcher at Duke University, notes that by providing better nutrition during drought, hardy maize would help maintain people’s immune systems and make them better able to resist infectious diseases. In the United States (the largest maize producer), hardier plants could reduce irrigation demand and consequent runoff. Irrigation represents more than half of the world’s freshwater demand, yet most of that is lost to evaporation, and runoff can pollute surface and groundwater with agricultural chemicals. Gallie sees another potential benefit. With climate change, he says, competition between urban and agricultural demands on scarce water resources is likely to intensify. Any crop that uses less water can help ease that conflict. Cohen concurs: “Efficient use of water is the dominant theme of twenty-first century agriculture.”",https://doi.org/10.1289/ehp.113-a232b,

Innovative use of fresh water, the world’s scarcest food production resource, is vital for family-run small-holder agricultural systems, which supply up to 80% of the world’s food. Agriculture employs 70% of Tanzania’s rural population and supplies 95% of the country’s food. The goal was to measure the impact of smart drip irrigation kits on smallholder farmers’ resilience and rural poverty in Tanzania. A household survey was conducted using an exploratory sequential design in four districts (Babati, Hai, Kasulu, and Kilosa) in Tanzania. A total of 383 respondents (Micro-investing (MI) farmers, n = 195; control, n = 187) were randomly selected from a pool of 3444 farmers. Partial budgeting and enterprise economic analysis were used for the calculation of gross margins, and multivariate analysis was used for poverty analysis. Gross margin analysis showed that communities using drip-irrigated vegetable farming are more profitable. Partial budgeting analysis showed that micro-irrigation increased the revenue generation for most vegetable varieties. However, multivariate analysis was unable to confirm that household poverty was markedly reduced through the adoption of this technology. Half of the MI farmers could afford an education for their children due to the extra income generated from MI.

Considering the level of poverty and food insecurity in the region, there is an urgent need for a sustainable increase in agricultural produce. However, farming approach in the region is primarily traditional. Traditional farming is characterized by high labor costs, low production, and under/oversupply of farm inputs. All these factors make farming unappealing to many. The use of digital technologies such as broadband, Internet of Things (IoT), Cloud computing, and Big Data Analytics promise improved returns on agricultural investments and could make farming appealing even to the youth. However, initial cost of smart farming could be high. Therefore, development of a dedicated IoT cloud-based platform is imperative. Then farmers could subscribe and have their farms managed on the platform. It should be noted that majority of farmers in SSA are smallholders who are poor, uneducated, and live in rural areas but produce about 80% of the food. They majorly use 2G phones, which are not internet enabled. These peculiarities must be factored into the design of any functional IoT platform that would serve this group.

Various sustainable land management (SLM) technologies that help conserve and better use natural resources and hence improve the incomes and livelihoods of farmers are available and being adapted to these regions. However, to achieve better adoption by farmers and to ensure positive results from implementation, the SLM technologies in WANA and CA need to be disseminated on a large scale. Identifying the potential areas to target the implementation of selected SLM practices is necessary to help decision makers and facilitate the out-scaling process. With participation of specialists from the National Agriculture Research Systems, three agro-ecosystems, rangeland, irrigated, and rainfed, were defined for the WANA region, and the mountain agro-ecosystem was added for CA. Each agro-ecosystem was represented by a benchmark site where selected SLM technology was demonstrated. In WANA, these benchmark sites included the water harvesting Vallerani system (contour ridges and semicircular bunds) for rangeland, water-saving (raised-beds and deficit irrigation) for irrigated, and supplemental irrigation for rainfed agro-ecosystems. In CA, sites included pasture improvement for rangeland, raised-beds for irrigated, conservation agriculture for rainfed, and agro-forestry for mountain agro-ecosystems. The criteria used to identify potential areas for out-scaling consisted of land use, slope, water resources availability, precipitation, degree of land degradation, livestock density, soil depth, soil texture, and soil salinity. Global spatial datasets, such as the FAO Land Degradation Assessment in Drylands project (LADA), soil data from the Harmonized World Soil Database (HWSD), and soil depth from the Soil Map of the World were used to derive the required database. Available national data provided by the participating countries were used as supplemental sources. The derived maps were validated and verified by an interdisciplinary team of experts and researchers from the countries in both regions. Verification of the maps derived at regional level - using low resolution data, with more detailed data for some countries - indicated that potential areas for out-scaling SLM could be generally identified. However, for implementation purposes and to derive the extent of the potential areas, detailed data at national level is needed. Yet, the results are useful to guide decision makers to first identify the extent and distribution of the potential areas for each SLM and agro-ecosystem and, second, to prioritize the implementation.

Other estimates predict that in 2020, 35 to 40 million urban residents of Africa will depend on urban agriculture to feed themselves (Denninger, Egero, & Lee-Smith, 1998). In 2008 the world’s urban population outnumbered its rural population for the first time. It is estimated that the world’s urban population will double from 3.3 billion in 2007 to 6.4 billion in 2050, and that by 2030, 6% of the world’s population will live in cities (UNFPA, 2007). In most developing countries, more than half of the urban population lives below the poverty level of USD1 per day (UN, 2008). To cope with urban poverty, many people turn to farming; it is estimated that between 15% and 20% of food throughout the world is produced in urban and peri-urban areas (Armar-Klemesu, 2000). Estimates show that at least two million hectares (4.9 million acres) in both urban and rural areas around the world are irrigated with treated, untreated, or partially treated wastewater (Jimenez & Asano, 2004). We carried out a study in Nairobi aimed at generating data on the contributions of wastewater farming to the livelihoods of the urban poor. The survey among 232 wastewater-farming households was complemented by focus-group discussions in two informal settlements in Nairobi, and revealed that wastewater farming benefited both farmers and their neighbors by providing food, employ­ment, and income. Over 60% of labor was provided by women. Fewer than half the farmers used manure or chemical fertilizer, as many believed that wastewater contains plant-based nutrients. The wastewater farmers experienced challenges in insecure land tenure, conflict with the city council, conflict in sharing resources, and com­petition for space between farming and housing. There was a generally low level of knowledge about the safe use of pesticides among those surveyed, and further research is recommended on this topic as well as on the health risks of wastewater farming. There also is a need to establish platforms to discuss and resolve resource-use conflicts in wastewater farming, as well as on issues related to incorporating urban agriculture into urban land use.",https://foodsystemsjournal.org/index.php/fsj/article/download/46/45,

Most of the rural population of the developing world lives without access to formal electrification. Electricity is one of the prerequisites for significant sustainable economic growth, being a reliable and reasonably priced energy essential for value-added agricultural and postharvest processes. Modern energy supply also enables more intensive agriculture by providing irrigation (pumps) and immediate post-harvest treatment (cooling) and storage. Solar radiation can be converted into electricity using photovoltaic panels. Industrialized countries present a trend towards grid-connected photovoltaic systems, as battery energy storage is not required and the electricity is supplied to the network. Therefore, it is more economically interesting to supply the electricity produced by a photovoltaic system to the electricity network than to use it to drive a chiller. Providing a reliable water supply for both human water pumping systems and agricultural needs in rural areas is one of the main applications of PV energy. The least expensive method of pumping water using PV energy is by connecting a DC motor without batteries (Abidin & Yesilata, 2004). Battery-less systems that directly couple PV modules to variable speed DC pump motors seems to have high potential for energy efficient and cost effective reverse osmosis desalinization (Ghermandi & Messalem, 2009). A simple irrigation fuzzy logic model analyzed the pumping system together with the crop to obtain the time of year to irrigate for compensating the lack of water (Damak et al., 2009). The use of pumped water for energy storage is an innovative alternative to battery storage due to its unlimited storage duration (Manolakos et al., 2004). Many machines have been constructed thinking in photovoltaic powering. As photovoltaic panels can provide excellent energy on places with daily radiation of 4-6 kWh/m2 prototypes are being constructed so that life becomes easier. For example, in African countries milling the average daily consumption (2.5 kg of grain) takes three hours (Chinsman, 1985).

The purpose of this article is to identify irrigation technology, the impact on irrigative farming of a polluted water environment through mining and other baneful industrial activities in the Republic. It also aims to discuss innovation opportunities in irrigation technology for using virtual water – a concept commonly associated with the Middle East. South Africa possesses arguably the most sophisticated engineering technology in irrigation in southern Africa. In this article, reflections on irrigation from the past to the present will be complemented by a historical focus of the context in which this farming enterprise evolved. A brief historical synopsis of irrigation shows that this activity which became more technologically advanced in the colonial and post-independence eras was also practiced in the pre-colonial period for food security and as an insurance against drought. Irrigation was practised in South Africa before and after the colonisation of the Cape by the Dutch in 1652. Irrigation technology in the seventeenth century tended to lack the sophistication and modernisation of the contemporary world. Innovative improvements became imperative as the state increasingly became more involved in agriculture from the 1920s and 1930s largely as part of a process leading to the evolution of settler irrigation policy which was premised on capital accumulation and the deprivation of Africans of land ownership rights. This policy orientation clearly changed from the advent of independence to the 21st century in favour of a policy that aimed at economically empowering the Black smallholder sector farmers without necessarily neglecting the large• 202 New Contree, No. 61 (May 2011) scale commercial producers. Irrigation farming is not a novel phenomenon to the region. Since the turn of the new millennium, technological innovation has been prioritised because South Africa is situated in a predominantly hot arid zone of the sub-region. Total evaporation creates endemic water shortages. It is therefore imperative that water resources are well managed in a country which thrives largely on mining, industrial and agricultural pursuits. Due to South Africa’s geophysical location in one of the world’s arid terrains, irrigation has been identified as an essential corollary to dry land farming and other economic endeavours. Nevertheless, in spite of advances that have been made in centre-pivot manufacturing, South Africa has generally tended to ignore cheaper irrigation methodologies such as the drip, terracing and flood systems which seem more suitable and appropriate in arid conditions. It has also ignored the fact that using large volumes of both riparian and imported water from Lesotho to irrigate a crop like maize in the Eastern Free State Province, for example, is not only unviable but it is also unsustainable. A major rethink of how food supply can be boosted on the basis of irrigated agriculture, utilising more advanced and peculiarly suitable technology in hot and arid or water deficient areas is vital. This is more so because industrial demand for water – a large quantity of which is expensively procured or transferred from Lesotho through the Vaal River system - is in direct competition with the demand for water to produce surplus food under irrigation. Most industrial and farming activities in Gauteng, Free State and Mpumalanga provinces, to name a few, are dependent on this water which is under threat of depletion. Given South Africa’s arid conditions, the adoption of the virtual water concept, following the Saudi Arabian experience, would be a possible conservationist measure. This article also argues that because water is limited, mining and air pollution which eventually ends up in the water should be controlled to ensure safe drinking and irrigation water.",https://newcontree.org.za/index.php/nc/article/download/357/408,

It accounts for about 70 percent of the global staple foods production (Cooper et al. 2009). This is the main mode of production favored by poor farmers in the developing world and other economically deprived societies (Wani et al. 2009). The contribution to global food supply from rain-fed agriculture is forecasted to decline from 65 percent at present to 48 percent in 2030 (Bruinsma 2003). The decline of precipitation forecast for some regions of the African savanna may affect agricultural production in different ways. During the already dry months, the decline of precipitation is likely to reduce the resilience of some plants (Vanacker et al. 2005). This is especially true for many ecosystems in Sub-Saharan Africa, particularly grass and shrub savannahs, which are shown to be highly sensitive to short-term availability of water due to climate variability (Vanacker et al. 2005). While the ranges of species may shift as a result of changing climate, this shift may probably not be in cohesive and intact units and are likely to become more fragmented (Channell and Lomolino 2000). This stimulates interest in understanding the effects of climate change on the potential for rain-fed agriculture for particular regions where this practice has important economic and social implications. While observed and measured data increasingly support predictions of a warmer world in the next 50 100 years, the impact of rising temperatures on rainfall distribution patterns in the semi-arid tropics of Africa remain far less certain (Cooper et al. 2009). African countries are particularly vulnerable to climate change because of their dependence on rain-fed agriculture, low economic power, low levels of human and physical capital, and poor infrastructure (Nelson 2009). The negative effects of climate change on agricultural production are especially pronounced in Sub-Saharan Africa because of the significant contribution of the agricultural sector to the GDP, export earnings, and employment (Fan et al. 2009). Cameroon, like many countries in sub-Saharan Africa has a high share of total poverty in the rural sector and a high share of GDP growth originating in agriculture (De Janvry 2009).

Walps, is an important food legume in developing countries, mostly in sub-Saharan Africa, Asia, and Central and South America (Singh et al. 1997). Cowpea has been referred to as “poor man’s meat” because of its high protein content (20-25%) (Diouf and Hilu, 2005; with Kareem and Taiwo, 2007; Sharmar et al., 2013). In Cameroun, the Far North Region is the largest contributor to the national production of cowpea, and the crop ranks second after groundnuts in the category of leguminous crop (Dugje et al., 2009). The production in this region ranges from 300 to 500 kg/ha in farmers’ fields and 1200-2000 kg/ha in research stations (Dugje et al., 2009). According to Bidima (2012), the Western region also produces significant quantities. Overall, the national production in Cameroon is estimated to about 110,000 tons from a planted area of 105,000 hectares (Bidima, 2012). Biotic and abiotic factors affect significantly yield and productivity of many crops worldwide. Among the abiotic factors, the salinity of the soil appears as the major factor that severely reduces agricultural productivity throughout the world (Epstein et al., 1980). According to Rengasamy (2010), salinity affects more than 800 million hectares of the cultivable land worldwide. Salinity stress in the soil is induced by a wide range of dissolved salts, but sodium chloride (NaCl) is the most widespread one which explains the intensive investigations carried out (Munns and Tester, 2008). Salinization of soils occurs primarily due to agricultural practices that include poor water management, high evaporation, and exposure to seawater (Pitman and Lauchli, 2002). This salinity is quite widespread in many arid and coastal zones. The important presence of salt in the soil is a problem that restricts yield of several crops on millions hectares worldwide of irrigated lands (Epstein et al., 1980). This is why a large proportion of irrigated lands are being removed every year from crop production (Epstein et al., 1980).

The situation is worsened by rapid urbanization and population growth in developing countries, thus increase competition for water used for irrigated agriculture. Various efforts have been made by the authorities in the developing countries to provide sufficient water and improve the quality of water resources. Yet, there are still many developing countries facing shortages of water for domestic and agricultural purposes, especially during the dry months of the year. Libya is one of the Northern African countries that have been experiencing water shortages especially in urban areas. This paper aims to identify the current situation and constraints of water resources management in Libya. The latter part is devoted to the solutions and recommendations at individual, community, state and government levels that can help solving the water problems in Libya. A number of previous studies on the water resources management and challenges perceived by both developed and developing countries were critically reviewed. It was found that water scarcity in developing countries is expected to be worsen as their population are expected to increase gradually year by year and it can be summarized from the reviewed previous studies that lack of government planning, industrial and human wastes along with government intervention and mismanaging water resources are some of the critical constraints towards achieving sustainable management in most of the countries including Libya. Potential solutions such as improving supply demand and good quality management of water resources must be taken into consideration.

Yet, more than 650 million people worldwide still used unimproved sources of drinking water in 2015-a significant portion of the population of sub-Saharan Africa and Oceania relied on rivers, lakes, ponds, and irrigation canals (UNICEF, World Health Organization 2015), leading to waterborne diseases such as diarrhea and a high rate of mortality among children. Developed countries also grapple with providing safe water supplies due to aging infrastructure, as illustrated by lead contamination of drinking water in Flint, Michigan. In addition to drinking water, water resources provide ecosystem services such as recreation and wildlife habitat that can be severely affected by contamination. In an assessment of 32 percent of the rivers and streams in the United States, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) (2015) found that the quality of the water supplied by 56 percent of those waterways was inadequate to fully support recreation, habitat, and other designated uses. Degraded water quality worldwide is driven by population growth, expanding industrial and agricultural activities, urbanization, decaying infrastructures, and more-frequent extreme weather events associated with climate change.Increasingly complex water quality problems call for more effective and rational approaches to water quality management. This issue of Agricultural and Resource Economics Review focuses on the economics of water quality, advancing our understanding of policies, valuation, and behavioral economics, which play critical roles in debates about how to assess and address water quality challenges. The studies span from individual decision-making and valuation of water quality to assessing the efficiency of institutions that address nonpoint-source pollution. Advancing nonmarket valuation can not only improve our understanding of nonmarket values but also contribute to improving the performance of institutions.Managing Nonpoint-source PollutionIn both developed and developing countries, the most prevalent problem associated with water quality is eutrophication-contamination by nutrients from run-off that choke waterbodies with excessive plant growth (including toxic algal blooms), deprive fish and other species of dissolved oxygen, and sometimes produce toxins. In the United States, eutrophication is caused primarily by nonpoint sources of pollution such as agricultural run-off. Nonpoint-source (NPS) pollution is poorly regulated, and the contamination caused by it remains mostly unmitigated, unlike contamination from point sources, which came under the purview of the Clean Water Act in the 1970s. Given the environmental damage caused by NPS pollution and the high cost associated with remediation and abatement, better ways of managing water quality resources are urgently needed.Developing safe healthy water supplies and mitigating the effects of existing pollution require vast investments of capital, and the economic tradeoffs can be daunting. In 2009, for example, U.S. agricultural producers supplied crops and livestock worth $331 billion to global markets and, concurrently, released a significant amount of NPS pollutants into U.S. rivers and other waterways from their activities (EPA 2009). Consequently, negotiating tradeoffs between the benefits of high-quality water supplies that produce key economic goods and services and the costs of developing, restoring, and maintaining those supplies is a critically important area of economic research.Economists have identified NPS pollution as the major threat to water systems in the developed world (Olmstead 2010). NPS pollution comes from a variety of sources, including run-o ff of storm water, fertilizers, and animal waste and old or poorly managed wastewater treatment systems, leading to excess nutrients (e.g., nitrogen and phosphorus) and hypoxia. …",https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/552E78FD8F1B9224C79BD15B616147E6/S2372261416000278a.pdf/div-class-title-special-issue-on-economics-of-water-quality-challenges-policies-and-behavioral-mechanisms-div.pdf,

Minerals (largely petroleum) accounted for an increasing proportion of exports through the 1970s, increasing from 13 percent in 1955 to 35 percent in 1965, to 93 percent in 1975, and then to the peak 96 percent in 1985. The dependence on oil and a few other export commodities made Nigeria (being a consumer nation) particularly vulnerable to world price fluctuations. God blessed Nigeria with vast arid land that can accommodate all classes of plants, crops, shrubs, and roots which should be able to feed the mass populace and should still remain in the form of exports which can generate foreign exchange earnings; hence to reverse our balance of payment deficit. Nigeria has emerging, though currently underperforming manufacturing sector is the second-largest on the continent, producing a large proportion of goods and services for the West African region.",https://doi.org/10.7237/sjarm/102,

Irrigated agriculture shows significant improvement over rainfed agriculture productivity it provides improved resilience against climate variability improves food security and enhances intensification. Also, with a depleting resource base and with stagnating productivity in irrigated areas, improving the productivity of dryland agriculture is necessary to maintain food security at the national scale.To improve the conditions for agricultural production, investments are needed in soil and water conservation to improve soil fertility, increase soil moisture and allow for supplemental irrigation in critical stages of growth.Generally, over 40 percent of the world area is categorized as dry-land developing countries where its accommodate 2.3 billion people mostly in Africa and Asia, and in these regions about one billion people rely on dry-land ecosystem services through rain-fed, irrigated farming and pastoralism. Dry-land areas are categorized by a scarcity of water, which has an impact on food production. Efficiency in irrigation system would help food production sustain especially in dry-land developing countries. Improvement in irrigation could be extended over an additional 110 million ha in dry-land developing countries, producing enough grain for millions of people where more than half of future increases in crop production are expected to come from irrigated land. There are two types of known irrigation systems, namely large-scale and small-scale irrigation. Most of the dryland developing countries are engaging in small-scale irrigation systems, as they are more affordable than those of large-scale systems, but are still capable of increasing food production. Water harvesting is one of the small-scale techniques of collecting runoff rain water for irrigation purposes and has significantly improved both the yield and reliability of agricultural production. The objective of this review is to examine the Opportunities and challenges of irrigated crop production in dry land developing countries. Ethiopia’s dryland agriculture is a high-risk, low-input enterprise for resource-poor farmers, who frequently use poor quality seed, inadequate and imbalanced fertilizers, and poor crop management practices. Consequently, crop yields are much below their demonstrated achievable potentials. Remedial measures for improving crop productivity include effective rainwater harvesting, land consolidation, improved credit facilities, better soil and water conservation, use of good quality seed, balanced nutrient management, and weed control.

These changes may be of relatively short duration or last for an extended period that could be decades or longer [Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), 2007)]. Throughout history, earth’s climate has been changing naturally. However, the rapid warming we have been witnessing in the past several decades is not solely the result of natural processes. Some are attributed to an increase in anthropogenic activities such as burning fossil fuels for the production of personal and commercial transportation, deforestation, and various agricultural and industrial practices (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2010). With the increase in the world population from 1.25 billion in 1850 to 6.5 billion in 2005, world energy consumption has increased 40 times (Lal, 2007). The earth’s atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration was 280 mmol mol until the 1800s. It increased exponentially during the industrial era reaching 315 mmol mol in 1957 and 362 mmol mol in 1994 (Schimel et al., 1994). Human activities have increased atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases such as CO2, methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O), which occur naturally in the atmosphere (IPCC, 2007) resulting in a 0.74 C rise in the global average surface temperature to approximately over the past 100 years (Trenberth et al., 2007). As of 2010, the atmospheric CO2 concentration is 388 mmol mol and it is expected to increase to 450 mmol mol by 2030 and 700 mmol mol by 2050 (IPCC, 2001) as the world’s population approaches nine billion (United Nations, Department of Economic and Social Affairs Population Division, 2009). A number of studies have shown positive effects on plant growth and productivity from an increase in atmospheric CO2 concentration (Kimball et al., 2002). An increase in CO2 concentration (from 330 mmol mol to 660 mmol mol) increases yields of C3 crops [e.g., soybeans (Glycine max L.), cotton (Gossypium spp. L.), alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.), wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), rice (Oryza sativa L.), barley (Hordeum vulgare L.), and potatoes (Solanum tuberosum L.)] by 33% and yields of C4 crops {e.g., corn [Zea mays] and sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench.} by 10% (Kimball, 1983; Long et al., 2006; Pinter et al., 2000; U.S. Climate Change Science Program, 2008). In addition, studies showed that CO2 enrichment alone could boost water use efficiency and increase yield of waterlimited crops (e.g., grains) (Drake et al., 1997; Idso and Idso, 1994). For example, in addition to increases in yield, CO2 enrichment increases water use efficiency (WUE) in wheat (Hunsaker et al., 1996), soybean (Jones et al., 1985a, 1985b), and rice (Oryza sativa L.) (Baker et al., 1990). Similar observations reported by Conley et al. (2001) indicted that cumulative evapotranspiration of sorghum was reduced without a loss in yield. Other beneficial effects were documented by Wechsung et al. (1999) on the increase of root growth and biomass of wheat under dry conditions and that of cotton (Rogers et al., 1992) as a result of CO2 enrichment. Projected increases in CO2 and air temperature will continue to contribute to climate warming in the next century (Alcamo et al., 1996; IPCC, 2001). The northern high latitudes have warmed by 0.8 C since the early 1970s (Hansen et al., 1999). Warming is predicted to be greatest at high northern latitudes during fall and winter (IPCC, 2007) with reduced rainfall in the subtropics and increased precipitation in eastern America, northern Europe, and parts of Asia. Such changes appear to have a profound effect on plant periodicity as has been found in Europe (Menzel and Fabian, 1999), and plant phenology (IPCC, 2001), especially for plants that depend on accumulation of degree-days to reach flowering or fruiting (Peñuelas and Filella, 2001). The increase in temperature may extend the growing season (longer crop cycle), i.e., early planting and late harvest time will be anticipated (Porter, 2005). It has been documented that flowering had been 1 week earlier in the Mediterranean plant species for 1952–2000 (Peñuelas et al., 2002), in Hungary for 1851–1994 (Walkovszky, 1998), in Wisconsin for 1936–1998 (Bradley et al., 1999), and in Washington, DC, for 1970– 1999 (Abu-Asab et al., 2001). It is expected that the production of certain crops may shift across regions as a result of climate change. Increases in temperature will cause the optimum crop growth latitude to move northward. For example, yields of some agronomic crops such as soybean are expected to decrease in southern U.S. states (U.S. Climate Change Science Program, 2008) and increase in the Midwest (Boote et al., 1996, 1997). Similarly, warming temperatures will cause production of many cool-season vegetable crops [such as potato, lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.), broccoli (Brassica oleracea L.), and spinach (Spinacea oleracea L.)] to decline. In addition, it will negatively impact fruit trees such as apples [Malus ·sylvestris (L.) Mill. domestica (Borkh.) Mansf.] that require a certain amount of chilling (Hartfield et al., 2008). In northern temperate areas, heat-demanding warm-season crops [e.g., corn and sunflower (Helianthus annuus)] are projected to replace many of the present grain cereals and oilseed crops (Olesen and Bindi, 2002). Thus, the impact of climate change on agriculture will lead to intensified production in northern Europe and less in southern Europe exacerbated by a reduction in water use for irrigation resulting from increased water scarcity (Alcamo et al., 2007; Olesen and Bindi, 2002). The effect of high temperature may surpass the impact of water availability for plants. For example, under well-watered conditions, when increases in temperature exceed the temperature threshold for pollination, grains may not produce seed and the quality of vegetable crops (e.g., tomato, Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.) may decrease (Kunkel et al., 2008). The impact of night temperature on plant growth and yield is as important as that of day temperature. Warmer nights increase plant respiration rates, resulting in further depletion of carbohydrates and yield reduction of fruits and vegetables [e.g., snap beans (Phaseolus vulgaris L.)] (Arevalo, 2008). Bud, flower, and fruitlet abscission is commonly found in tomato plants grown under high night temperatures, especially because tomatoes require lower night than day temperatures (Peet et al., 1998; Sato et al., 2004). Increases in the average global air temperature will likely lead to changes in precipitation and atmospheric moisture and such changes may vary from region to region (IPCC, 2007). Although some regions (e.g., tropics) will experience more frequent and intense precipitation events, precipitation is expected to decrease in other regions (e.g., the Mediterranean, northern Africa, northern Sahara, Central America, the American Southwest, and southwestern Australia during winter). Water scarcity, as a result of changes in precipitation patterns and intensity and decreases in natural water storage capacity from glacier or snowmelt-fed river basins, will increase the competition between agricultural and urban users as population growth increases. Under climate change, water and its availability and quality will create bigger challenges than energy security (IPCC, 2008). Agriculture is the dominant user of fresh water (Gleick, 2003a,2003b), and demandforwater will continue to increase with increases in population and economic growth (Rosegrant et al., 2009). It is anticipated that the world’s population will approach nine billion by 2050 (United Nations, Department of Economic and Social Received for publication 8 Oct. 2010.

Now, Africa appears to emerge as a key player in food production because there exists enormous unused land for cultivation. On the basis of availability of data, this study aims at investigating the impact of the climate change on rice production in the twenty-five African countries from 2002 to 2014 following a static panel data approach using World Bank and Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) data. Considering CO2 (Carbon Di Oxide) emissions as average precipitation in depth and temperature change as climate change indicators along with other control variables such as fertilizer consumption and use of pesticides, this study observes that these climate indicators have significant adverse impact in explaining variations in spatial and temporal change in rice production in African countries. It may be demonstrated from the empirical analysis that those climate variables like CO2 emissions, pesticide use and temperature change are statistically significant at a 5 %, 10 % and 5 % levels, respectively. All the indicators have negative effects on rice production in African countries. The coefficients associated with these indicators are negative and statistically significant indicating that higher CO2 emissions adversely affect rice production in Africa. Moreover, pesticides used per kg in production have an inverse relation with rice production in this continent. Further, temperature harms rice production in African countries. Temperature changes negatively affect rice production as indicated by its coefficient value being -199958.10. The results also demonstrate that adaptation of new rice seed varieties that are more tolerant to higher temperature will be more effective in response to climate change. The study suggests that there is need for enormous development in the agriculture sector, to reach the ultimate goal. In particular, development of irrigation system and large-scale funding by the government in African countries is required.

Changes in climate, increased frequency and intensity of climate shocks (such as drought, flooding and extreme temperatures) as well as changing distribution and timing of rainfall are major factors which negatively affect sustainable crop production. This needs the solution to feed rapidly increasing population in the world especially African countries due to their less ability to cope the climate change. Therefore, one of the proposed means is climate smart agriculture. CSA is defined by three objectives: firstly, increasing agricultural productivity to support increased incomes, food security and development; secondly, increasing adaptive capacity at multiple levels (from farm to nation) and thirdly, decreasing greenhouse gas emissions and increasing carbon sinks/sequestration. There are many agricultural practices which are important for this approach some of them include conservation agriculture, agro forestry, soil and water conservation techniques and irrigation practices. CSA integrates climate change into the planning and implementation of sustainable agriculture and informs priority-setting. Identifying appropriate ways to incentivize the uptake of climate smart alternatives is a key priority to improve productivity and reduce yield variability.

But the most powerful underlying emotion for their unreasoned fear—rapid human population growth—is rapidly becoming irrelevant. Will biotechnology overcrowd the planet by saving more sick people while producing more food to fuel more population growth? In a word, no. The opposition of the eco-activists is ironic, at least. Without the Green Revolution's high-yield farming, the world would already have had to clear most or all of its 16 million square miles of forests to produce today's food supply. Plant breeding, chemical fertilizers, irrigation pumps, and pesticides have been the key technologies to date in “growing more food per acre to leave more room for nature.” But each of these advances in farming has been pilloried by activist groups who claim to fear insect-protected cotton (that helps prevent devastation of the textile-dependent economies in China and India), vitamin-A-enriched “golden” rice (to prevent blindness in poor Asian children), and blight-resistant potatoes (that could prevent a re-enactment of the Irish potato famine in potato-dependent Bangladesh). Why are these people not joyful about the conservation benefits of high-yield farming? Apparently because they fear growing more food will mean even larger human populations. Fearing overpopulation was understandable in the 1960s, when the Green Revolution was suddenly tripling Asian crop yields and DDT began preventing millions of malaria deaths. Today, however, the world is 40 years into the first era when bigger harvests mean better nutrition for children instead of more people. The world's population surge is losing its steam, even though the number of people added each year is still near all-time highs. In a completely unexpected development, world birth rates per women have plummeted as radically as death rates in the era of modern medicine. Third world birth rates have come three-fourths of the way to stability, having dropped from 6.2 births per women in 1960 to 3.1 today. (Stability is 2.1.) This trend in birth rates is massive and unprecedented. The UN Population Division has just—again—lowered its estimate of the peak human population, this time to between 8 and 9 billions. (We are at 6.3 billions now.) Poor farmers almost always have big families, but affluent urban couples almost always have two children or less. The entire world (except Africa) is now on the path to urban affluence. Africa, eventually, will find its way along the same path. The eco-activists seem equally unaware that the UN Environmental Program's new Atlas of Biodiversity notes the world lost only half as many species (a combined 20 birds, mammals, and fish) to extinction in the last third of the 20th century as in the last third of the 19th century. Why the dramatic improvement? In the 19th century, man was clearing lots of forest to plant more low-yield crops. Today, we are raising yields and planting high-yield tree plantations for our lumber needs. Meanwhile, the World Conservation Union (IUCN) worries most about the one billion poor people living in the world's biodiversity hot spots, and trying to feed their families by hunting bushmeat and slash-and-burn farming. Only biotechnology is likely to provide new answers to the needs of these third world peasant farmers. But won't more (and more affluent) people inevitably take more resources away from nature? Again, no. Stone-age hunters had to exploit natural resources. That is why they eradicated dozens of mammal and bird species in North America, including our horses, camels, and ground sloths. Today, biotechnology can create new resources. Bacillus thuringiensis varieties are producing 80 percent more cotton per acre in India and 80 percent more corn per acre in the Philippines because they deal more effectively with the potentially ruinous tropical pests. That effectively creates more cropland. Biotechnology tomatoes can grow in far saltier water, which effectively creates new water supplies. The eco-activists propose to “solve” the food problem by subtracting resources, most notably the 80 million tons of natural nitrogen that conventional farmers take from the air each year to make “chemical” fertilizer for their crops. Organic farming, ardently promoted by the environmentalists, bans “synthetic” nitrogen. The world would need the manure from another 7 to 8 billion cattle (and 3 to 30 acres of forage per beast) to supply all-organic nitrogen today, and far more by 2050. The organic “solution” would immediately force us to clear virtually all the world's wildlands to grow clover—or doom one-third of the world's human population. Apparently, the eco-activists would like to solve the competition for land between people and wildlife by eliminating people. But in the 21st century, with rising farm productivity and rapidly declining birth rates, setting the needs of people and wildlife needlessly against each other is both inhumane and environmentally irresponsible. Genetic engineering, both in medicine and agriculture, is good for people and the planet.",https://doi.org/10.1155/s1110724304004000,

Neotectonic activities not only influence the landform and Land use but it has the potential to influence the water resources. Archival LANDSAT/IRS and latest CARTOSAT data of a part of the National Capital region shows that the Yamuna River has shifted towards north eastern direction in reference to the Delhi ridge. In the adjacent of Yamuna River, Gautam Buddha Nagar deposition of recent sand deposit proves that the river is shifting towards north eastern direction. Besides changes in the position of the river the sand-clay deposition has changed the groundwater quality. An investigation being carried out since last two decades in and around parts of Haryana-Delhi-Noida-Ghaziabad area to infer the changes in geological fracture/faults. These structural anomalies inferred as lineament length and density and its correlation with ground water quality are alarming for the local inhabitants of National Capital Region of India Surface water and Groundwater resources are dependent on each other. Terrain information is essential for the water resource understanding Surface water flows depends on the structural tectonics and geological variability Dissolution of the cations and anions varies in space and time depending on the tectonic and climate variations. In tectonically active areas if the rainfall is high the process of groundwater quality can be slow. Besides this microtremor activity within the semi arid area in a part of the National Capital Region has been studied to infer probable changes in the hydrogeochemistry of the alluvial aquifers. Epicentral clusters identified within Rohtak and Sonipat boundary as well as in the western Jhhajhar district which is North West of Delhi show water level fluctuations using the mean water level fluctuation from 2000 to 2016. The region with the water level rise and fall coincide with the area of the epicentral clusters. Further, it has been reported that the local topography of the area predisposes it to flooding events falling in the linear transect of Rohatak-Sirsa-Hissar as the region forms a saucer shaped depression causing the flood water to accumulate although no concrete evidence suggests so. The current study suggests that the region has frequent seismic activity along the intersection of the two regional faults causing abrupt water level fluctuations at these clusters. The hydrogeochemistry of the region shows that the groundwater has high salinity in some shallow and deeper aquifers probably due to the observed frequent water level fluctuations which could be due to the combined effect of both anthropogenic factors (agricultural return flow, canal irrigation etc.) and natural factors (seismicity, high mineral dissolution etc.) or both. The water of the alluvial region of the study area where most of the seismic clusters are present has its major ion geochemistry mainly influenced from rock water interaction. Efflorescence evaporation due to irrigation return flow is also one of the main factors for the high salinity as well as the presence of some ionic concentrations in the aquifer samples besides silicate and carbonate weathering and mineral dissolution. Majority of the samples from the study region for pre-monsoon show both carbonate and silicate weathering as the processes controlling major ion chemistry whereas for post monsoon samples, majority shows increase in silicate weathering. Therefore, both ion exchange and reverse ion exchange processes are governing the chemistry of the aquifer waters in the pre-monsoon samples whereas the post-monsoon water chemistry is predominantly controlled by reverse ion exchange processes for a majority of the aquifer. The potential seismic hazard in Delhi and adjoining areas is attributed to the Himalayan Thrust System and reactivation of fault systems of the Delhi Fold Belt. The historical and modern seismicity records indicate that the fault Delhi-Sargodha Ridge (DSR) and Aravalli-Delhi Fold axis are the most seismically active zones. The seismicity of the region is due to bending of the lithosphere prior to underthrusting below the Himalayas. A study evaluating the seismic potentiality of Delhi-Rohtak area has also shown high percentage of Fe and Mn in active fault zones.4",https://medcraveonline.com/IJH/IJH-01-00003.pdf,

The soil-to-plant Transfer Factors (TF) and Health Risk Index (HRI) were calculated. The highest mean levels of Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb, and Cu were detected in spinach while the highest mean level of Zn was found in onion. Iron levels in lettuce, spinach, beetroot, onion, and carrot ranged from 2203 to 3404 mg/kg which was above the permissible limits (450 mg/kg) recommended by the Food and Agriculture Organization–World Health Organization (FAO/WHO). The concentration of Pb (0.4 mg/kg) and Cr (13.8 mg/kg) in spinach exceeded the permissible level recommended by FAO/WHO of 0.3 mg/kg and 1.3 mg/kg, respectively. The metal transfer factors in vegetables were in the order: Cd>Pb>Cu>Fe>Ni>Co>Zn>Cr>Mn. The daily intake and HRI of Mn and Fe in vegetables were above safe levels. There was no obvious heavy metal contamination in the soil and irrigation water. These results suggest that the consumption of vegetables grown on the study site could pose danger to human health. High heavy metal content in crops was attributed to the accumulation of Fe and Mn, which are the major ores extracted from the mining activities in the study area.

The paper examines innovative wastewater treatment methods like biofiltration, membrane bioreactors, and electrocoagulation, exploring their effectiveness and limitations. It emphasizes the significance of proper wastewater treatment in mitigating risks and maximizing benefits. Key considerations such as economic viability and social acceptance are highlighted, urging comprehensive cost-benefit analyses and active engagement with stakeholders. Drawing from case studies in Tshwane, Egypt, Valencia, and Sde Warburg, successful wastewater reuse practices underscore the importance of stringent water quality standards, public education, regulatory frameworks, and stakeholder involvement in achieving sustainable wastewater management. Despite global advancements, challenges persist in the adoption of these technologies in many African countries, necessitating collaborative efforts and targeted capacity-building for widespread implementation. Historical insights reveal the evolution of wastewater irrigation from European and American cities to its current global prevalence, impacting around 10% of the world’s irrigated land with untreated or partially treated wastewater. Technological advancements, such as biofiltration relying on microbial activities, membrane bioreactors integrating biological treatment with filtration, and electrocoagulation as an electrochemical process, offer sustainable solutions. Case studies highlight the economic, environmental, and social benefits of successful wastewater reuse programs. However, the review acknowledges the risks associated with wastewater reuse, including environmental contamination and public health hazards. To strike a balance between risks and benefits, the paper advocates for proper wastewater treatment, robust regulatory frameworks, and responsible farming practices. It concludes by stressing the need for collaborative efforts, international partnerships, and targeted capacity-building initiatives to overcome barriers to the adoption of advanced wastewater treatment technologies in African countries, fostering water management, ensuring food security, and contributing to social and economic development amid global challenges.",https://www.ijscia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Volume4-Issue6-Nov-Dec-No.539-1038-1048.pdf,

The degradation of the Aral Sea began in the 1960s when larger portions of the Syr Darya and Amu Darya were diverted for irrigation and to provide for the household needs of Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, and southern Kazakhstan. As a result, the sea significantly withdrew from its shores and exposed the seabed, which was covered in sea salts contaminated by pesticides and other chemicals [1,2]. In today’s day and age, desertification is one of the world’s most serious problems. Desertification bears unexpected and undesirable consequences for mankind. The increasing land degradation accelerates the lowering of agricultural yields, which will eventually lead to the impoverishment of the local population and will cause people to migrate from their homes. For this reason, desertification is one of the most worrisome problems facing mankind today.

INTRODUCTION Scarcity of conventional sources of water in arid and semi-arid regions of the world has been behind the movement to find alternative or additional sources. Some of the possible sources are: deep groundwater, treated wastewater, and brackish water. Deep groundwater is not always available and can be very costly to access. Wastewater, when treated, is a relatively stable water source that has uses in agriculture, industry, recreation, gardening, industrial-plant cooling, and 41 Bull High Inst Public Health Vol.39 No.1 [2009] recharge of groundwater (1). At 2.8% Middle East and North Africa countries, MENA, has one of the highest average population growth rates in the world. Combined with scarce natural water supplies these results in very low per capita water availability, expected to decline to 725 m3 per capita, per year (pcpy), by 2025, far below the benchmark level of 1000 m3pcpy used as an indicator of severe water stress. Countries in the region which practice wastewater treatment and reuse include Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Oman, UAE, and Egypt. However, only Tunisia, and to a certain extent, Jordan, already practice wastewater treatment and reuse as an integral component of their water management and environmental protection strategies (2). The reclaimed water as percent of total wastewater volume in some Middle East countries is recorded as 1, 1, 6, 9, and 15% in Suadi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan, Qatar, and Kuwait; respectively. A number of countries in the Middle East are planning significant increases in water reuse to meet an ultimate objective of reusing 50 to 70 percent of the total wastewater volume (3). Health risks are one of the major concerns about effluent reuse. Some risk factors are short term and vary in severity depending on the potential for human, animal or environmental contact, while others have longer term impacts that increase with increased use of reused water. The main concerns are pathogens such as viruses, bacteria, protozoa, and Helminthes, and trace organics and heavy metals, endocrine disrupting chemicals, and pharmaceutically active compounds (1). The Hyderabad Declaration on Wastewater Use in Agriculture 2002, Hyderabad; India, stated that with proper management, wastewater use contributes significantly to sustaining livelihoods, food security and the quality of the environment.

In this mini-review, we have discussed why the Faculty of Medicine, University of Gezira (FMUG), Sudan, can lead in social accountability in Africa and the Middle East. This critical analysis is based on searching the literature published in PubMed, Medline, Scopus and Google scholar. We added sections about reflection on opportunities and future direction for FMUG on social accountability. Many unique features in the curriculum that led to excellence in teaching, research and service, will qualify FMUG to lead in social accountability. The location in the heart of Sudan and being community-oriented medical education meant that FMUG, over the last 45 years, gained and mastered the art of social accountability. FMUG continues to be a leader in medical education and has a pioneer master's program in medical education. The majority of the graduates who are not staff members continued to support the medical school many years after their graduation (teaching, research and donation) and promote the concept of social accountability at the national and international level. The curriculum meets all of the competencies of social medicine. Hence, graduates are influential leaders in all medical specialties, and most importantly, in addressing the priority health concerns of the community in rural and urban areas. Therefore, through research and innovations, FMUG can establish social accountability alliance for medical schools and consider adding more unique components to the concept of social accountability (promotion of concept health made at home, especially during COVID-19 pandemic). For instance, retention and recruitment of doctors (training and promotion) and brain drain are main challenges to many health authorities in African and Middle East countries. Another area of innovation, is environmental social accountability of medical schools in order to develop environmentally sustainable solutions to address health concerns especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. This of considerable importance as Gezira state has one of the largest irrigation agriculture schemes in the world. We believe that medical schools' concept of social accountability will continue to evolve, likely depending on the community's needs. © Journal of Public Health and Emergency.

The processing of cassava is known for its high consumption of water resources. This study therefore investigates the potential for cassava processing water conservation using combined peroxide-oxidation and adsorption recycling processing technology. A Sequential Peroxide-Oxidation and Adsorption treatment process was established by producing cassava peel carbon and activated carbon from waste cassava peels. This was used in the adsorption of pollutant parameters in oxidized cassava processing wastewater. The study further went on to estimate the volume of water that could be conserved in Nigeria through the employment of the Sequential Peroxide-Oxidation and Adsorption treatment process with the aid of a 3-scenario water-based estimation techniques. The research revealed that the estimated volume of water employed in processing cassava through fermentation process is about 1,525 l/ton while that for non-fermentation process is about 960 l/ton. However, an estimated 104,951.36, 100,195.20 and 95,639.04 million litres of water could be conserved considering each of the three cassava process combination scenarios. The study concluded that if cassava industry could make use of the combined peroxide-oxidation and adsorption recycling processing technology described as in the experimental procedure, substantial volume of water resources could be conserved and recycled for other uses such as irrigation, as well as groundwater recharge thereby improving water budget.

This study used the Cobb-Douglas linear regression model to test hypotheses. The study found that employment and capital have a positive and statistical effect on the Jordanian agricultural sector. The effect was insignificant with a value of 0.5997, which is greater than 5%. The results also show that agricultural output works at a declining rate of return for volume as the total elasticity of the two components of production for labor and capital are less than the right one, where agricultural output is growing at a slower rate than the increase in labor and fixed capital. Technology has no significant impact and this may be due to the low knowledge and skills of the labor force. Therefore, it is recommended for those interested in the agricultural sector to increase the skills of agricultural labor and provide them with modern agricultural knowledge . Introduction The economic status of nations is almost synonymous with the extent of their progress in the various fields of technology. It is common knowledge that referring to a country as a developing country means that it does not have the technology to elevate it to the ranks of the advanced industrialized countries in the field of technology. Therefore, the concern of developing countries is to take advantage of modern technology in various economic sectors to improve economic growth rates. The agricultural sector is an important sector in the economies of countries because agricultural production is a strategic commodity, because arable land is often limited, water resources are limited, and agricultural production is increased. It is recommended to use the best agricultural technology to ensure productivity and efficiency of the agricultural sector in Jordan, to develop the agricultural sector through legislation and the use of advanced agricultural technology. International Journal of Academic Research economics and management sciences Vol. 7 , No.1, January 2018, E-ISSN: 2226-3624 © 2018 HRMARS 63 The agricultural sector in any country in the world plays an important role in the economic and social development process. Successful development experiences in various countries of the world have shown that the agricultural sector plays a central and pivotal role in the rise of the state and economic and social progress. The importance of the agricultural sector is also increased by contributing to production and employment and increasing the country's GDP, as well as being a major source of food for the population, providing the economic sectors with the necessary productive inputs, in addition to absorbing labor and increasing agricultural exports and their diversity, and 28% of the GDP of other sectors is directly or indirectly dependent on the Jordanian agricultural sector. Global agriculture, including agriculture in the Arab region and Jordan is one of it, faces many difficulties and challenges such as global climate change and changes in the level and time of rainfall. The Arab region is one of the most agricultural areas that have suffered during the past decades. This has led many researchers to find solutions that reduce these effects, Where the thinking of technology has become a basic and logical solution to these challenges, especially in the light of the large and increasing demand for food as a result of population growth and urbanization. The purpose of this study is to examine the impact of agricultural technology on the Jordanian agricultural sector. The rest of the study is arranged as follow: section 2, literature review, section 3 data and methodology, section 4 empirical analysis and results discussion and section 5 conclusions. Literature Review Studies have shown that agricultural knowledge and science and technology had contributed significantly in increasing agricultural production over time and contributing to food security through reducing cost reduction, increasing of efficiency and productivity improvement of the agriculture sector (Samah et al., 2009; Blattman et al., 2003; Nicholas, 2003; Ramírez; 2007; Díaz, Urquhart, 2009). . Scientists are taking advantage of technological advances in developing longterm food alternatives to alleviate the burden and difficulty of obtaining for their livelihood under the current changes. (Jaafrawi, 2011). Providing agricultural communities with access to information sources that can lead to the advancement of agricultural sectors and bring about real changes will create many opportunities for improvement at many levels, whether productive or labor, and provide content that was not previously available (Mustafa, 2012). The challenge facing agriculture in developing countries in the coming years is enormous, Especially if there is no response to the growing demand for food. Because of population growth and rising incomes, demand in developing countries is expected to increase by 59% for cereals, 60% for roots and tubers, and 12% for meat in the coming period. This expansion of demand can not result from any significant expansion of irrigated area due to water competition with urban demand and environmental problems and while it will therefore need to come from growth in yields. It is worth noting that the growth rate of cereals in developing countries is declining From an annual average of 2.9% in the period 1967-1982 to 1.8% in 1982-2001. (Janvry et al., 2001). International Journal of Academic Research economics and management sciences Vol. 7 , No.1, January 2018, E-ISSN: 2226-3624 © 2018 HRMARS 64 Therefore, the decline in the rate of growth in production should be stopped. Increases in yield should be compared to current trends in part. As the rate of growth in production achieved through traditional plant breeding and agricultural practices is declining, the next phase of increases in production. Agriculture should rely on the scientific progress of biotechnology. However, while biotechnology has made impressive progress in agriculture in some of the more developed countries, it has had little impact in most developing countries and therefore the aim of studies should explore the conditions that can help the current technological revolution which is vital in agriculture in developing countries. (Shaibu, et al., 2008). Empirical Evidence The study of Milovanović (2016) aimed to analyze the role, potential and contribution of IT in agriculture business. the study find that IT has great potential for supporting farmers and the other stakeholders in improvement of efficiency, effectiveness and productivity of agriculture. The study of Joseph Chissa, et al., (2013), aimed to prove the relationship between the agricultural production in South Africa and the independent variables represented by credit in banks, agricultural production requirements, and employment as well as rainfall by using CobbDouglas production function. The study showed that there was a statistically significant effect of bank credit and agricultural production requirements, while the results of the study did not show a statistically significant effect of both employment and rainfall on agricultural production. The study also found that the estimated production function is of a fixed size. The study of Jaafrawi and Inas (2011 aimed to study the determinants of the Egyptian agricultural production function for the period(1985-2011). The study assumes that the independent variables (crop intensification, agricultural production requirements, size of agricultural labor, agricultural output of a previous period) have a significant effect on the dependent variable (Egyptian agricultural output). The descriptive approach has been used to present theoretical principle in the economic thought of the production function. In addition to describing the factors of production factors needed to construct the model of the production by using the production function of (Cobb -Douglas) in line with the nature of the Egyptian agricultural sector. In order to study the relationship between the dependent variable and the independent variables by introducing new independent variables, such as the variable of agricultural output for the previous period, and the variable of crop intensification to express the production element of technical technology, in addition to the traditional production elements of capital and labor. The results of the study showed that the crop density, production requirements, agricultural workers and agricultural output for the previous period had a positive and significant effect on the Egyptian agricultural output. The econometric model explains 99% of the change in the Egyptian agricultural output. The study of Susan (2011) The aim of the study was to measure the economic impact of improved agricultural technologies on cassava productivity in the state of Koji, Nigeria. The results were drawn from a household survey covering the 2009/2010 agricultural season. The data obtained from the interview table were subjected to descriptive and deductive statistical analysis.

Careful management of water resources has been an absolute necessity in this region where annual renewable water supplies average about 435.2 billion cubic meters (BCM), compared to Africa's 3,950 BCM, Asia's 12,009 BCM, and the world total of 43,764 BCM. The Middle East region’s water security and internal variables has been worsening since 1960s, has not become a political issue because it has been possible to deemphasize the problem. As it is fundamental to the internal variable in Middle East such as, political changes and tensions, social, economic, and environmental sustainability of every community and every political economy, water is a strategic resource. In political economies where water sustainability is narrowly defined as water self-sufficiency, water will be identified as a particularly strategic resource. A regional security complex is defined as the integration of regional relations resulting from the rapport de forces particular to the region, which is determined by asymmetries of power, the Middle East region, with its many ideological, religious, and geographical disputes, extensive water resources, such as the Nile, Tigris and Euphrates river valleys, are coming under increasing population, irrigation, and energy pressure.

In this paper, we tackle this challenge by employing data-driven techniques to develop forecasting tools for three widely used crop-productivity related variables (i.e., actual evapotranspiration, reference evapotranspiration, and net primary production), which can then be used by farmers to take corrective actions on their farms. Prior work in this domain, despite using data-driven methods, suffers from two major limitations: (i) they mainly focus on estimating variable values (as opposed to forecasting the future); and (ii) they mostly use classical Machine Learning (ML) prediction models, despite the abundance of data sufficient to train sophisticated deep learning models. To fill this research gap, we collaborate with PlantVillage, the world’s leading non-profit agricultural knowledge delivery platform for African farmers, to identify ∼2,200 smallholder farm locations, and gather remote-sensed data of these farms over a period of five years. Next, we propose CLIMATES, a meta-algorithm leveraging structural insights about temporal patterns of this time-series data to accurately forecast their future values. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate its performance in this domain. Our experimental results show that CLIMATES outperforms several state-of-the-art time-series forecasting models. We also provide insights about the poor performance of some competing models. Our work is being evaluated by officials at PlantVillage for potential future deployment as an early warning system in East Africa.

However, most countries in this subregion do not yet have the irrigation technologies that are already applied in many more advanced nations, which further exposes them to the serious risk of severe drought caused by global warming. This study investigates the potential impact of solar radiation modification (SRM) geoengineering on the water availability over the four major river basins that cross most of Central African countries (i.e., Niger Basin, Lake Chad Basin, Cameroon Atlantic Basin and Congo Basin). For this purpose a potential water availability index was computed based on an ensemble-mean simulations carried out in the framework of Phase 6 of the Geoengineering Model Intercomparison Project (GeoMIP6), considering two SRM simulation experiments: the stratospheric sulphate aerosol injection (G6sulfur) and the global solar dimming (G6solar). The climate change simulation results in a robust decreases by up to 60% in water availability, most pronounced over the Cameroon Atlantic Basin under the hight radiative forcing scenario. Therefore, in a business-as-usual world, the reduction in water availability combined with the rapid population growth expected by 2050 in the studied region, could result in a significant water deficit over Central African countries towards the end of the 21st century. This water deficit can affect all activities that depend on water resources, such as water supply, agriculture and hydropower generation. Furthermore, the results also show that SRM methods have the potential to significantly reduce this deficit by increasing water availability (as compared to climate change) by up to 50% over the affected river basins, with a more accentuated increase found in the Cameroon Atlantic Basin when the global solar dimming is applied. These results suggest good possibilities of adaptation for populations living in the geographical areas of these river basins.",https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ad657d/pdf,

More details than are given in the report are needed before the full significance of these experiments can be assessed. Food yeast has been used in treatment of vitamin B deficiencies. Subjects who were given 7 or 5 g. daily improved or were cured in the course of five or seven weeks, while little change was seen among the controls. Manufacture of food yeast from molasses and ammonium salts has been started in the West Indies; the yearly output anticipated is of the order of 2,500 tons,3 which would provide 1,000,000 people 1/4 oz. (7 g.) a day for a year. How could this supply be best used? Peoples in Africa, who formerly depended on yeasts in fermented drinks for their supply of B vitamins, suffer from deficiency diseases since they have changed over to more sophisticated food. Food yeast could restore these vitamins, though in a less interesting vehicle. Even the 3 g. of protein would add appreciably to the value of the diets of people who get a large proportion of their calories from cassava. And food yeast could also be used to make up for the deficiencies of polished rice. Two per cent. of food yeast can be added to white flour without affecting the flavour of bread made from the flour. This suggests a new way of putting back some of the good which is removed in milling white flour. The latest argument in favour of 73 % extraction is that hens do not get enough riboflavin if they are not given whole grain; that we cannot have both our pre-war supply of whole eggs and 85% flour. But putting the yeast into debased flour seems a roundabout process. Why not give the hens the food yeast and leave us our 85 % flour ? A supplement of 5 to 10% to the balancer meal for domestic poultrykeepers is recommended. Food yeast is not a magic key to the problem of the world's malnutrition. The daily dose recommended supplies only a fraction of some of the nutrients needed, and the amounts that could be made would supply this dose to an even smaller fraction of the people who lack these nutrients. It would not add the calories that are needed to prevent famines, nor increase the fertility of the soil. The long-term solutions are to be found in the wider use of legumes that put nitrogen into the soil, and in the steps proposed by the World Conference on Food and Agriculture-irrigation, prevention or Wure of erosion, use of fertilizers, and a gradual change to mixed farming. But food yeast should mitigate some of the present evils and be a useful adjunct in the future.

Will coming decades finally end this chronic cycle of want? Andwhere does tropical medicine fit in the modern nexus of food, agriculture, and health? In November 2017, a meeting at Stanford University provided a modern primer on rural poverty and agricultural development with a special focus on Africa. The conference featured four global leaders: 1) Agnes Kalibata, Rwanda’s former Minister of Agriculture and Animal Resources and current President of the Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa (AGRA); 2) Kanayo Nwanze, Past President of the United Nations’ International Fund for Agricultural Development and winner of the 2016 Africa Food Prize; 3) Rajiv Shah, President of the Rockefeller Foundation and former Administrator of the United States Agency for International Development; and 4) Usha Barwale Zehr, Director and Chief Technology officer at Maharashtra, one of India’s largest multinational seed companies. Seated next to me at Stanford was a former college classmate. An industrial engineer and entrepreneur, from 2004 to 2009 Thomas Riley also served as the United States Ambassador to Morocco, where he helped negotiate the first-ever free trade agreement between the United States and an African nation. Since then, Riley has continued to visit Africa and connect with fellow ambassadors. Impulsively, I asked Tom for his thoughts about current funding for African development. “Too much US government investment in health, not enough in agriculture,” he replied, matter-of-factly. His comment stuck with me. Then came the round-table and some irrefutable facts. As moderator Etharin Cousins stated at the outset: “Today some 100 million of the farmers across Sub-Saharan Africa farm less than 2 hectares of land. Eighty percent of those living in rural areas are poor. More than 30%of the rural population are chronically hungry and 35% of the under-5-year-olds are stunted.” By 2050, when the world’s population is expected to top 9 billion, Cousins (who formerly directed the UN World Food Program) added, Africa will have experienced the lion’s share of growth. KanayoNwanze added a rhetorical question about a central paradox of Africa—namely, that a continent possessing twothirds of the world’s uncultivated-but-fertile land continues to suffer devastating food insecurity. “By 2050, who is going to feed Africa? A man in his 60s? A woman with a hoe? No! Africa needs the agriculture of tomorrow, which will first feed Africa, then the world.” Nwanze is not just good with words. Originally trained as an agricultural entomologist, early in his career, hehelpedwith efforts to control a potentially devastating influx of mealworm attacking African cassava; asDirector-General of theAfricaRiceCenter, he also promoted New Rice for Africa, a high-yield, droughtand pest-resistant strain specifically developed for Africa. A day later, I ordered Nwanze’s book. Published in 2017, “A Bucket of Water—Reflections on Sustainable Rural Development” is a slim, thoughtful work describing many strategies that could further increase smallholder yields in Africa and beyond. The book also discusses climate change and soil degradation, civil conflict and migration, women’s role in farming, the retention of young people in agricultural enterprise, and the promise of research, technology, and innovation from gene-edited seeds to reliable electricity, internet connectivity, and satellitebased imaging (to help grow drought-resistant crops, for example) as well as improved storage and transport of crops and access to financing and insurance to accelerate uptake of new technologies. “A Bucket of Water” also offers lessons from Asia, where 38% of cultivated land is currently irrigated as opposed to 6% in Africa, and in South Asia, where 149 kg of fertilizer is applied per hectare of land. In Africa, the current use of fertilizer is nearly 90% lower. Agnes Kalibata is another agricultural entomologist who has championed smallholder access to improved seeds as well as networks of “agro-shops.” First appointed Rwanda’s Minister of Agriculture in 2008, 6 years later, she moved to AGRA, an organization jointly funded by the Gates Foundation and the Rockefeller Foundation. Kalibata’s dedication to private-sector cooperatives resonates with Nwanze’s pragmatic take on farming. As he writes in A Bucket of Water, “Profit and income are not dirty words for poor farmers. Whether the entrepreneur is a multinational firm or a young woman selling vegetables at a roadside stand, farming is a business.” Usha Barwale Zehr cited the legacies of the Rockefeller and Ford Foundations in bringing “good, high-yield planting material” to India and forecast future public–private partnerships in Africa focused on hybrid seeds and solar-powered water pumps. Rajiv Shah not only touted real-time data to sustain maximum productivity but predicted that Africa could someday lead the world in cultivating proteinand micronutrientrich crops. So, once again, what is the take-home for members of the American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene? Can those fighting tropical disease share “space” and resources with experts and visionaries in global agriculture? At the very least, should not we engage around important areas of overlap? Rajiv Shah, the only medical doctor on the Stanford dais, would likely agree. In another 2017 speech, he reiterated a core belief shared by John D. Rockefeller, Sr. and Frederick Gates, Rockefeller’s chief philanthropic advisor. “Scientific agriculture,” said Shah, “was seen (by them) as a promising way to fulfill their foundation’s mission of promoting the wellbeing of humanity throughout the entire world. Initially, the foundation fought disease—building schools of medicine and public health, combating yellow fever and malaria. Then after seeing millions starve during World War II, and as booming population growth threatened to outpace global food production, Rockefeller turned to fighting hunger as the greatest enemy of human well-being.”",http://www.ajtmh.org/deliver/fulltext/14761645/98/6/tpmd180231.pdf?itemId=%2Fcontent%2Fjournals%2F10.4269%2Fajtmh.18-0231&mimeType=pdf&containerItemId=content/journals/14761645,

Globally, sorghum is cultivated on 41million hectares to produce 64.20 million tonnes, with productivity hovering around1.60 tonnes per hectare. With exceptions in some regions, it is mainly produced and consumed by poor farmers. India contributes about 16% of the world's sorghum production. On global front, sorghum was grown in 105 countries of the world in the year 2010-11 covering an area of approximately 40.5 m ha with grain production of 55.65 m tons and an average productivity of 1.374 tons per ha (FAO website: http://www.fao.org). During the last three decades period (1980-2010), cropped area and production reported an annual growth rate of -0.34% and -0.51% respectively. Development and adoption of the improved cultivars, improved management practices have increased the productivity levels significantly despite tumbling acreage of sorghum across the globe in recent past. Sorghum primarily produced in India (7.38 m ha) constitutes about 18.21% share in global area followed by Sudan 5.61 m ha (13.85%), Nigeria 4.7 m ha (11.6%), Niger 3.3 m ha International Journal of Current Microbiology and Applied Sciences ISSN: 2319-7706 Volume 9 Number 12 (2020) Journal homepage: http://www.ijcmas.com Attempts have been made to examine the trends and forecasting in area, production and productivity of Sorghum crop in Telangana State.

But, the lion share in global sorghum production is contributed by USA (15.7%) followed by India (12.58%), Mexico (12.47%) and Nigeria (8.59%). The productivity in developed countries is about five times higher than the productivity in developing countries. The world highest productivity levels were observed in USA (4520 kg per ha) while the productivity in India is hovering around 949 kg per ha. In India, this crop was one of the major cereal staple during 1950's and occupied an area of more than 18 million hectares but has come down to 7.69 million hectares (TE 2010). Sorghum grain yields in India have average 1170kg/ha in the rainy season and 880kg/ha in the post rainy season in recent years ICRISAT, (2014). Sorghum is the world’s fifth most important cereal after wheat, rice, maize, and barley in both production and area planted (FAO/ICRISAT). Sorghum is one of the main staples for the world's poorest and most foodinsecure people. The crop is generally suited to hot and dry areas where it is difficult to grow other food grains. These are also areas subject to frequent drought. In many of these areas, sorghum is truly a dual-purpose crop; both grain and stover are highly valued outputs. In large parts of the developing world, stover represents up to 50 percent of the total value of the crop, especially in drought years. Developing countries account for roughly 90 percent of the world’s sorghum area and 70 percent of total output (FAO/ICRISAT). Asia and Africa each account for about 25 to 30 percent of global production. Nigeria and Sudan are the major producers in Africa. Production in Africa remains characterized by low productivity and extensive, low-input cultivation. Generally, sorghum is grown primarily for food in the developing countries and in the developed countries almost all sorghum production is used as animal feed. All India total sorghum production has registered a constant growth rate of 0.10% per annum during the period 1967-68 to 20102011 which can be mainly attributed to negative production of kharif sorghum rather than positive growth in rabi sorghum production. Though, kharif sorghum yield growth rates were relatively higher, it could not offset the declining growth rates in production, as the growth rates in kharif sorghum area were negative and high. Just opposite is true in case of rabi sorghum where the area decline was not sufficient to undermine the yield growth, thus resulting in positive production growth rates. Telangana is the twelfth largest state in India in terms of area. Sorghum is an important staple cereal crop grown mostly under rain fed conditions in Telangana. The crop is grown in kharif season in about 1.09 Lakh ha in Telangana with a production of about 1.11 Lakh mt at an average productivity of about 1015 kg/ha. (Www.icrisat.in. retrieved on 2014-03-29) The present study is based on 36years of data i.e., from 1979 to 2015 of Sorghum in Telangana State. The linear growth rate (LGR) and compound growth rate (CGR) for the crop characteristics i.e., area, production and productivity of Sorghum crop in Telangana State are estimated by fitting the following functions, the analysis of the data has been carried out by using data on area production and productivity obtained from web site: www.indian stat.com. Rao (1965) made an attempt to analyze the trend in agricultural growth in the country as a whole and in different states during the period 1949-50 to 1961-62 to determine the Int.J.Curr.Microbiol.App.Sci (2020) 9(12): 2514-2524 2516 major components of agricultural growth. He concluded that the rate of food grains output decreased at the rate 4.4 % in the period 1949-50 to 1955-56 to 3.8 % in the period 1955-56 to 1961-62. The growth rate of aggregate crop output remained more or less constant at 4 % despite acceleration in the rate of growth of non food grains from 3.0 to 4.5 %. The growth in productivity was found to be positively correlated with the irrigated area. Chada (1967) studied the ground nut crop during 1945-50 to 1964-65. There was linear growth rates of 4.65, 5.23 and 0.32 in area, production and productivity respectively of groundnut for Punjab state during study period and for total oilseeds, they were 2.93, 3.85 and 0.66, respectively, at all India level. Tyagi et al., (1974) attempted to measure the impact of green revolution by estimating linear growth rates for two periods of time between 1950-51 and 1970-71. The estimates of growth rates were suffered from limitations of standardization because he had taken ‘b’ as growth rate. Pavate (1979) made an attempt to study the compound growth rates of area, production and productivity of cotton in during the three decades. During the period of the first two plans increase in area (3.8 %) rather than increase in yield, which actually fell to -1.1 %. In the next decade, all the three items did not show any significant raise as the growth rates for area, production and productivity were only -0.2, 0.3 and 0.5 %, respectively. Yoginder Alagh K et al., (1980) aimed at studying the growth rates of crops for the periods of green revolution (period I: 1960-61 to 1969-70) and post-green revolution (period II: 1970-71 to 1978-79). The study revealed that the estimated growth rates in sub-period II were higher than those for sub-period I and that the growth was more evenly spread in sub-period II. Materials and Methods Methodology for the estimation of growth rates The study was based on 36 years of data i.e., from 1979-80 to 2015-16.

INTRODUCTION The present work was conducted to evaluate the effect of radio elements in the black sands of eastern and western Rosetta branch, Egypt on macro and micro-elements of Aerva plants. The agricultural development represents the main solution for facing the drastic demands for food, all over the world. The development may be occurred through several ways. One of them in the Northern Delta area is raising the soil surface level by adding some sandy layers. These sandy layers most probably will contain black-sand and some wild plants. However, the greatest part of the blacksand was found in Rosetta area, and possibly the largest known accumulations of blacksands on the African coast, (Davidson, 1950). The black-sands contain some heavy and radioactive minerals. The radioactive minerals contain potassium, uranium and thorium. Although, potassium is one of macronutrient for plants was undergoes a simple from radioactive decay. The decay of uranium and thorium proceeds sequentially along a chain disintegrations (IAEA 1979). Uranium content of soil is highly variable with values ranging from 1 to 8 ppm, the average being about 1 ppm, (IAEA, 1988).

English This paper primarily attempts to detect the trend in the present upshots of global warming temperature data. It has been done through the estimation of the long memory fractional parameter using a simulation technique in the presence of additive outliers which stands as wild observations generated in the atmosphere due to global warming. Then, the study investigates empirically the impact of global warming on the particular aspect of global agricultural production. Based on Monte Carlo simulations, a data generating process is applied where additive outliers are generated in a discrete way. Observed facts reveal that additive outliers affect the bias and the MSE of the estimated fractional parameter. The size of the additive outliers in data generating process has also important effects on the estimated fractional parameter depending on the value of true fractional parameter. The result exhibits a non-trend or a natural cyclical variability influenced by a stochastic process in the case of climate change behavior with wild observations (outliers) that produce a contradictory outcome of profound uncertainties against the case of true world temperature data trend. The results of empirical investigations assert that in the late 21st century unabated global warming would have a negative impact on global agricultural production in the aggregate and the impact could be severe if carbon fertilization benefits (enhancements of yields in a carbon-rich environment) do not materialize, especially if water scarcity limits irrigation. In addition, if warming would not halt in the 2080s, but would continue on a path toward still higher global temperatures in the 22nd century, agricultural damage could be more severe. The study also shows that the composition of agricultural effects is likely to be seriously unfavorable to developing countries with the most severe losses in Africa, Latin America and India.",https://doi.org/10.21082/jae.v26n2.2008.123-143,

Data for the study were obtained from the Central Bank of Nigeria Statistical Bulletin. In order to achieve the objective of the study, Augmented Dickey-Fuller Unit Root, Johansen co-integration and Vector Error Correction Model were employed. The unit root test conducted shows that the variables were integrated of order one i.e I(1), which means that the variables are stationarity at first difference. The co-integration results showed that long-run equilibrium relationship exists among the variables. Result of the regression shows that government capital expenditure on agriculture has a positive and significant impact on agricultural output, while Government recurrent expenditure on agriculture also has a positive impact on agricultural output in Nigeria. Furthermore, the study also reveals that personal income tax has a negative and insignificant impact on agricultural output. Also, findings from the Variance Decomposition reveal that the predominant sources of variation in all the variables can be attributed to its own shock. The study therefore recommends that government should increase capital budgetary allocation to this sector in a consistent manner because of its importance to the development of the sector and to the national economy. The study further suggests that expansionary fiscal policy measures should be encouraged by the government because it will play a vital role in the growth of agriculture in Nigeria. If this measure is put in place, agriculturalists would be able to have more income to invest in agriculture. Even in the part of the government, when more money is allocated and effectively implemented in agriculture, there would be increase in agricultural output and this would increase the nation’s gross domestic product (GDP). Keyword: Fiscal Policy, Agricultural Output, Vector Error Correction Model, Nigeria, Taxation. Introduction The proven path to economic prosperity is agriculture. There is no region of the world that has developed a modern economy without first establishing a foundation in agriculture successfully. Even as it is now, there is no economy that can do without consuming one agricultural produce or the other. Agriculture has been and will continue to be the mainstay of most economies. International Journal of Academic Research in Business and Social Sciences Vol. 1 0 , No. 8, 2020, E-ISSN: 2222-6990 © 2020 HRMARS 226 In some developed countries like USA, Japan, UK, development in the agricultural sector has helped their industrialization process by providing the raw materials needed for production to a greater extent. In India, it was recorded that 28 percent of their national income comes from agriculture while about 70 percent of people in the country are engaged in agriculture where they earn income for survival. However, in Africa, agriculture creates most jobs for both the people practicing subsistence and commercial farming. Aside from the northern and southern African countries, in some oil producing countries like Nigeria, Cameroon, Cote d’Ivoire, agriculture accounts for half or more of the working population and also contributes to Gross Domestic Products (World Development Report, 2008). Since 1980 to 2017 there has been continuous increase in capital expenditure over recurrent expenditure. Data sourced from the CBN statistical bulletin 2017 shows that in 1984, government capital spending on agriculture was 25 million naira while that of recurrent expenditure was 2 million naira. Also, in 1994, which was ten years after, capital spending was 2.8 billion naira while recurrent expenditure was 1.2 billion naira. Furthermore, in 2017, capital expenditure on agriculture was 75 billion naira and that of recurrent was 68 billion naira. From these figures, it is evident that government channels more money to capital expenditure on agriculture than recurrent expenditure on agriculture. However, there are a lots of problems still facing the sector despite all the funds budgeted for the development of the sector. These problems are inadequate social and infrastructural facilities such as good roads, proximity to the market, electricity, storage facilities and so on. In spite of these, fiscal policy is viewed as an important policy instrument that can be used to develop agricultural sector based on its roles. It is against this backdrop that this study tries to investigate the impact of fiscal policy instruments on agricultural output in Nigeria. When it comes to the nation's development, agriculture is the main engine that stimulates economic processes because there is nothing in agricultural produce that is wasted (National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), 2016). Most of the produces are used as raw materials which are transformed into finished goods. A nation that invests in agriculture helps the industrial and other sectors of the economy to grow because of easy and cheaper access to raw materials. This brings about prosperity and development to an economy. Apart from raw materials for the manufacturing sectors, agriculture also plays some important roles which aid development. These roles include, sources of food for the growing population, foreign exchange earnings, source of income and savings for farmers, to mention but a few (Chandrasekaran, Annadurai & Somasundaram, 2010). In Nigeria, various policies have been formulated in order to realize these aforementioned roles. The policies also aim at strengthening agricultural sector. Some of these policies include, Operation Feed the Nation (OFN) in 1976, Green Revolution of 1980, Structural Adjustment Programme (SAP) in 1986, the Directorate of Foods, Roads and Rural Infrastructure (DFRRI) in 1987, Better Life for Rural Women also in 1987, Rural Agro-Industrial Development Scheme (RAIDS) in 2001, National Economic Empowerment Development Strategy (NEEDS, SEEDS and LEEDS) of 2003, Land Use Decree of 1976 among others. Although, these policies are important and laudable, they have not helped much in improving the agricultural sector significantly as it ought to be. The costs involved in executing these policies usually exceed the benefits ought to be derived. This might be because funds are not being channelled to real farmers or might be that the funds are diverted for other purposes. During 1960s and early 1970s in Nigeria, agricultural section was the most important based on its contributions to economic growth and development. This situation persisted for decades before oil International Journal of Academic Research in Business and Social Sciences Vol. 1 0 , No. 8, 2020, E-ISSN: 2222-6990 © 2020 HRMARS 227 sector took over in 1970s which caused a drastic decline in the agricultural's contributions to the development in the economy (Farm Management Association of Nigeria (FAMAN), 2011). The trend in the share of agriculture from early 1960s to date shows a huge variation and long-term decline. In 1960, it was recorded at 60 percent while in 1970 and 1980, it was recorded at 48.8 percent and 22.2 percent respectively (NBS, 2010). In 1993 and 1994, the major source of food accounted for about 30 percent of the GDP while livestock, forestry and wildlife, and fisheries accounted for 5 percent, 1.3 percent and 1.2 percent respectively (NBS, 2016). The major factor responsible for the decline in agriculture’s contributions to GDP may be attributed to the neglect of the sector as a result of oil boom. In 2016, NBS also estimates that 25 percent of the GDP of the Nigerian economy is composed of the agricultural sector and 70 percent of the Nigeria's labour force is employed in agricultural sector (NBS, 2016). It can therefore be seen that the growth and development of any nation depend to a large extent, on the development of agriculture. Nigeria which is naturally blessed and endowed with various natural resources such as good atmospheric condition, fertile and vast land, adequate rainfall, sufficient sunlight and so on, still hungry in the midst of plenty. This is as a result of underutilization or non-utilization of most of these natural endowments (Lawal, 2011). Nigeria‘s agricultural sector has been faced with several problems which hindered the growth of the sector and also inhibited its potentials to be fully realized. These problems include; inadequacies in the supply and delivery of farm inputs, shortage of working capital, low level of technology, diseases and pest infestation, poor post-harvest processing, poor storage facilities, inconsistent and poorly conceived government policies, problems of pests and diseases, negative attitude of people towards farming due to low reward, inadequate agricultural education and extensions, poor transportation, lack of credit facilities, irrigation problems, lack of investment, lack of basic infrastructure, inaccessibility to loan facilities due to high bank interest rates, inadequate fertilizers and farm implements, environment hazards, labor and land use constraints. Several researchers have investigated the impact of fiscal policy on agricultural sector development with mixed findings. For example, Zirra and Ezie (2017) studied the impact of government fiscal policy on agricultural sector output in Nigeria and discovered that government expenditure on agriculture has negative impact on agricultural sector. In another development, Aina and Omojola (2017) assessed the effect of government expenditure on agricultural output in Nigeria. The findings showed that there is a significant and positive increase of about 2 percent which is very low, between government expenditure on agriculture and agricultural output in Nigeria. However, as a result of the discrepancies in researchers' findings and with a strong view of how important fiscal policy instruments are in developing a nation, there is need to conduct further research in respect to the extent at which fiscal policy as impacted the g",https://hrmars.com/papers_submitted/7528/impact-of-fiscal-policy-on-agricultural-output-in-nigeria.pdf,

To capture the international trade in agricultural commodities, all opportunities, as they arose in the last World War, were harnessed and soil fertility was bartered away for the precious metal, as so much produce exported is so much soil fertility driven out of the land. Deforestation, to meet the needs of wood for fuel, cellulose, explosives, newspaper, books, rayon, match sticks, paints, varnishes &c. and to bring more land under the plough, for agricultural produce, brought in its wake, floods, erosion and the desert.

This could not have happened at a worse time, since the economy of the country was in a recession even before the pandemic. The situation is exacerbated by the highest level of unemployment in the world, widespread nepotism and corruption, the plundering of state coffers and the favouring of the business interests of BRICS partners by government officials over those of South Africans. The government's commitment to prioritising their BRICS partners' business interests over those of the South African people contributes to food insecurity in South Africa. This includes the export of coal from mines in Mpumalanga to China and India, while nothing is done to rehabilitate the region, which was once known for its agriculture. The government handed over to the Chinese company SAEMB the Musina-Makhado Special Economic Zone, where four opencast mines, a 3 300 MW power station and an iron smelting plant will be developed. This development, however, requires the government to build a dam that will harvest 60% of the annual runoff of the Limpopo River, which in turn will have a devastating effect on farmers and communities downriver in South Africa, Zimbabwe and Mozambique who irrigate their crops with water from the Limpopo River. The same kowtowing of the South African government to its BRICS partners can be seen in the reluctance with which the government responds to the plundering of our marine resources by Chinese fishing boats and abalone smugglers. The unfair competition imposed on local chicken farmers by distributers of dumped chicken, mainly from Brazil, with the approval of government, caused the closure of several South African chicken farms and the resulting loss of tens of thousands of jobs along the supply chain. The reluctance of the government to take sides in the Russia-Ukraine war is partly linked to the fact that South Africa imports fertilizer and wheat from Russia. South Africa, a water-scarce country, is more vulnerable than many other countries to the effects of global climate change. The abnormal rain pattern, that is characterised by severe droughts in certain regions and heavy rainstorms and floods in others, has a devastating impact on the already economically struggling South African community. Abroad, attempts are made to ensure that mean temperatures do not exceed the pre-industrial level mark by more than 1,5 °C. South Africa, however, heats up twice as fast as many other countries, and has already exceeded the pre-industrial era level by more than 2 °C;it will continue to get warmer and drier, causing most of the country to become desertified by 2050. A third of South African rivers do not reach the sea anymore because of over ion of water from rivers;similarly, there is extensive ion of groundwater. Together farming and forestry account for 70% of water use in South Africa. This over ion of water, worsened by the heat and aridification resulting from climate change, led to the degradation of most wetland and estuarine ecosystems and the drying and burning of irreplaceable peatlands. These political, socioeconomic and environmental calamities create the worst possible scenario for food security in South Africa. Already one in four people in Africa suffers from food insecurity and this number will rapidly rise in the wake of global climate change, which will result in the loss of two thirds of arable land by 2025. South Africa is nearing socioeconomic collapse. This, in conjunction with continuing droughts, storms and rising temperatures associated with global climate change, will lead to food insecurity, starvation and anarchy. The effect of global climate change will make it progressively more difficult to produce enough food for the South African population. It is imperative that South Africans consider alternative methods of food production, including water use. Entomophagy is widel practiced throughout the world, but is especially prevalent in South America, the Far East and Africa, where approximately 2 billion people use 1 900 species of insects as food. The nutritional value of insects is unsurpassed and, in some respects, even more nutritious than meat. The larvae of the black soldier fly (BSF) Hermetia illucens are a source of high-quality proteins and unsaturated fats that are used worldwide as animal feed. Insects are a source of minerals such as iron, calcium, copper, zinc and magnesium and high levels of vitamin A, B2 and C. The ecological and socioeconomic benefits of using BSF larvae instead of grain as feed for fish, chickens and pigs are enormous. BSF larvae can be bred almost for free by feeding it a wide variety of organic waste, including rotten vegetables and fruit, manure and even carcases that would have ended up in rubbish dumps and would have contributed to the methane and carbon dioxide pollution emanating from such dumps. The water use of BSF is negligible, because the water in the organic waste that would have been discarded in waste dumps is sufficient to sustain them. BSF affords the subsistence and small-scale farmer the opportunity to raise chickens at a lower input cost than ever before. The conversion of feed to food in insects is far greater than that of chickens, pigs or cattle. In the case of the house cricket (Acheta domestica) the conversion rate of feed to food is twice as effective as that of chickens, four times as effective as pigs and twelve times greater than that of cattle. Compared to conventional farming, this implies that with insects far more exceptionally nutritious food can be produced in a smaller area, with little water and no poison or fertilizer whatsoever, while waste and the associated methane gas are removed from the environment at the same time. A few South African companies have already seen the potential of insects as food and feed. Even though insect farming is still in its infancy, it is already generating jobs and new socioeconomic opportunities in South Africa. Insect farming, especially BSF farming, will in the near future probably grow in popularity all over the world as an affordable, healthy, ecologically sustainable alternative food source that will, directly or indirectly, be consumed by humans. BSF afford the environmentally conscious homesteader who wants to produce livestock such as chickens, fish, or pigs in a sustainable manner an unsurpassed environmentally friendly alternative. BSF will also give the desperate, impoverished and starving population of the future an alternative free source of feed that will offer them economic prospects and food security.

This makes this sector a critical factor in the depletion of water resources. Accordingly, this paper explores potential mitigatory impacts of climate-smart water management (CSWM) technologies in sub-Saharan Africa. About 70% of the population in sub-Saharan Africa is dependent on agriculture for sustaining their livelihoods. This is despite the low agricultural output in smallholder farming systems (SFS) due to water scarcity. This has spurred several attempts to promote the adoption of climate-smart agriculture (CSA) to raise agricultural outputs and improve smallholder farmers’ livelihoods. However, there has not been a comprehensive analysis of data categorised by various aspects of climate-smart water management technologies. In this systematic literature review, climate-smart water management technologies in sub-Saharan Africa’s agricultural sector were identified and analysed to determine strategies that could enhance their adoption and impact. To this end, academic articles reporting on the adoption of climate-smart water management technologies in databases were reviewed. Four significant literature databases were used. These were limited to Springer Link, ScienceDirect, MDPI, Wiley Online, and Google Scholar. The findings demonstrate that rainwater harvesting and micro-irrigation are the primary climate-smart water management technologies used by smallholder farmers. The literature review shows that adoption of CSWM practices is constrained by inadequate technological infrastructure, financial implications, unsuitable policies, and low user skills, particularly. It is therefore recommended that government agricultural departments and relevant advocates of CSA should incentivise and subsidise smallholder farmers to encourage CSWM technology adoption. This can be achieved through the implementation of suitable policies directed at technological infrastructure development, financial support for adoption, and technical skills training.",https://doi.org/10.3390/w16192787,

The manifestation of climate change such as rising temperatures, increasingly erratic rainfall, and more frequent and severe floods and droughts have grave consequences on the livelihood security of smallholder farming communities, making them more vulnerable. Agriculture plays a great role in the livelihood of rural communities in many African countries. Most such countries are, however, predicted to be among the globe’s most vulnerable to climatic changes (Schlenker and Lobell, 2010; Samson et al., 2011; Morand et al., 2012). Muller et al. (2011) noted that the negative consequences of climate change are anticipated overall for Africa where over 95 % of the farmers subsist on rain-fedagriculture. In Ethiopia, agriculture is the dominant sector contributing around 50% of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and 85% of total employment and livelihoods. It is also the major source of food for the population and, hence, the prime contributor to food security (CEEPA, 2006). Climate Resilient Green Economy (CRGE, 2011) noted that climate change has the potential to hold back economic progress, or reverse the gains made in Ethiopia’s development and could exacerbate social and economic problems. It is heavily dependent on rainfall, with irrigation accounting for less than 1% of the country’s total cultivated land. Crop production is dominated by small scale subsistence farmers (about 8 million households) who practice more traditional farming, accounting for 95% of the total area under crop and more than 90% of the total agricultural output (CSA, 2011). Vulnerable agricultural systems are most prevalent in arid, semi-arid, and dry subhumid regions of the developing world, home to half of the world’s currently malnourished Abstract: Agriculture remains the main source of food and income for most rural communities in Ethiopia. Understanding the impact of climate change on crop production can help to optimize schemes and increase yields. The main aim of this study was, therefore, to modeling climate change and its impacts on food barley (horduem vulgare l.) production using different climate change scenarios in Lemu Bilbilo district, Oromia regional state, Ethiopia. Time series anomaly for temperature showed that both annual maximum and minimum temperature have increased by 0.06 oC and 0.11 oC respectively and rainfall showed slight variability during the period of 1980-2010.The projected temperature and rainfall pattern shows that an overall increasing trend in annual temperature and significant variation of monthly and seasonal rainfall from the historical period of time. Days to flowering, maturity and yield of HB1307 variety simulated by DSSAT V4.6 model was calibrated and evaluated by Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Index of agreement (IA) and coefficient of determination (R2). Therefore, RMSE, IA and R2 revealed a very nice agreement with observed data’s set. The Results indicate that food barley yield decreases on average by 22%, 24% in 2030s RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 respectively. Similarly yield decreases on average by RCP4.5 (25%) and RCP8.5 (19%) in 2050s relative to the baseline (1980-2009) due to climate change. Early sowing should be considered as an adaptation strategy for food barley under future climate.",https://doi.org/10.20431/2454-9444.0503005,
